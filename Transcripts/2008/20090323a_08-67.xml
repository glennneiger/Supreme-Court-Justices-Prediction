            <text syncTime="7.323" offset="135753">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a jury's acquittal resolves an issue in a defendant's favor, that determination is final and the government may not seek an inconsistent determination of that issue from a second jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.801" offset="197611">Unlike acquittals, hung counts are not verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.424" offset="216106">They decide nothing, and therefore a hung count cannot be inconsistent with an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.561" offset="244736">A straightforward application of this Court's decision in Ashe v. Swenson is all that is called for in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.540" offset="284651">A new rule is not necessary.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="46.681" offset="293219">Mr. Buffone, may I raise one preliminary issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="50.837" offset="309833">And it's an issue which is -- does not go to the reason we took the case, but I'd like your response to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.773" offset="333552">Your argument, your Ashe v. Swenson argument, assumes, as you have said in the brief, that the -- that the verdicts of acquittal essentially determined that your client did not possess insider knowledge, and I question whether the verdicts of acquittal did necessarily establish that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.384" offset="428011">I've looked at the -- at the jury instructions, and I -- I will be candid to say I did not parse the whole jury instruction, so you may very well correct me in the assumption that I'm going to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.976" offset="486316">But the point of the -- of the jury instruction that seemed to go to your argument is set out on page 105 of the Joint Appendix, and the judge is telling the jurors what they had to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.231" offset="555384">And one of them was that your client made any untrue statement of material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.163" offset="631139">It seems to me that the jury under that instruction could have come back with a verdict of acquittal simply on the assumption that your client had not made affirmative statements at the -- at the meeting in question, therefore he had no obligation to -- to correct any statements, because it is not clear from this instruction that he had to correct the statements of other people who omitted material facts, and that therefore the only thing that the verdict proves or the only thing that the verdict may have assumed is that he didn't speak up and say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.521" offset="788501">Is that a possible analysis?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_j_buffone" startTime="174.456" stopTime="227.186">
            <label>Mr. Samuel J. Buffone</label>
            <text syncTime="174.456" offset="804279">I do not believe so, Your Honor, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.958" offset="818280">First, under the Ashe test as interpreted by this Court in Dowling, the record as a whole must be analyzed.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.609" offset="848896">And in Dowling, the Court looked at admissions made by the defendant's attorney during the course of the second proceeding that identification of his client was not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.416" offset="888080">Similarly here, looking at the entirety of the record, in its arguments closing and opening, and most importantly in its cross-examination of Mr. Yeager, the government made clear to the jury its theory of omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.894" offset="946072">And that theory of omission was that Mr. Yeager when he was at the 2000 analysts conference had a duty to stand up and correct omissions if there were any misstatements made by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.205" offset="995286">They argued to the jury that he would be guilty of omissions if he did not affirmatively correct it.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="227.186" offset="1015139">No, I -- I agree that -- that did seem to be the point of the cross-examination, and in fact I guess you set it out in one of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.806" offset="1049621">But is -- is that enough?</text>
            <text syncTime="238.228" offset="1059338">We -- to my knowledge, we've never held that that is enough to convert or -- let's say, to -- to -- for us to assume, despite a more protean jury instruction, that the jury necessarily had to find a -- a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.578" offset="1136765">And I guess maybe my question boils down to is: Why should what perhaps consumed 60 or 80 seconds of cross-examination suffice to tighten up a jury instruction which -- which basically is open-ended?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_j_buffone" startTime="276.194" stopTime="292.595">
            <label>Mr. Samuel J. Buffone</label>
            <text syncTime="276.194" offset="1211267">Well, Your Honor, first there was more to the trial record than a snippet of cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.334" offset="1239792">Again, in opening statement the government began by arguing to the jury that Mr. Yeager was the man behind the screen, that he was--</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="292.595" stopTime="328.907">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="292.595" offset="1276782">That's the government's -- that's the government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.079" offset="1286708">And in order to convict for securities fraud based on an omission, isn't it necessary for there to be a duty to disclose?</text>
            <text syncTime="303.747" offset="1321399">And what would prevent -- how can we be sure that the jury here did not find that there was no securities fraud because, insofar as the government was proceeding on an omissions theory, your client didn't have a duty to disclose, did not cause a material fact to be omitted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_j_buffone" startTime="328.907" stopTime="351.711">
            <label>Mr. Samuel J. Buffone</label>
            <text syncTime="328.907" offset="1422023">--Your Honor, first, the instructions permitted alternative ways to reach the first element of securities fraud, and one of the three alternatives was either misstatements or omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.603" offset="1484821">And I think the instruction, for all of its frailty, was clear that the jury could convict on an omissions theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.401" offset="1508018">Now, Your Honor's question--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="351.711" offset="1513242">I agree with that, but why couldn't they find that there was no securities fraud based on an omissions theory because there wasn't any duty on Mr. Yeager's part to disclose?</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel J. Buffone</label>
            <text syncTime="361.269" offset="1551485">--Your Honor, the indictment was an integrated theory of fraud, that had charged that Mr. Yeager and others had planned to make misrepresentations and material omissions for one purpose, and that purpose was to enhance the price of Enron stock so that they could later engage in insider trading to sell that stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.666" offset="1645108">The omissions theory was grounded in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.789" offset="1657647">It was elucidated by the instructions, and it was clarified so that there could be no uncertainty by the cross-examination and arguments of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.286" offset="1695577">This jury -- under an Ashe analysis, the question is what did this jury believe and what did they rationally decide?</text>
            <text syncTime="405.159" offset="1727028">They--</text>

            <text syncTime="407.158" offset="1735074">Ashe is a seriatim prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.844" offset="1749807">It was one event, a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.094" offset="1758793">There were six victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.545" offset="1764645">Victim number one -- the charge relating to victim number one, was an acquittal that necessarily decided that the defendant was not among the robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.228" offset="1827338">So that is quite a different situation from what we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.724" offset="1853356">--Justice Ginsburg, first, it is my belief that seriatim prosecutions raise no greater threat to the core values of double jeopardy than was raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.174" offset="1899123">Those core values are, first of all, the finality of acquittals.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.374" offset="1915946">And the acquittal here was offended by any effort to retry an issue of fact necessarily decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.734" offset="2065366">Your Honor, to the question of seriatim prosecution, again, although Ashe was in a sense a seriatim prosecution, in all of the Ashe-type cases decided by this Court jeopardy had not even attached, let alone terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.522" offset="2140494">The issue we believe should be addressed in terms of what was the finality of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.456" offset="2168289">The finality of the judgment here were six acquittals.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.502" offset="2180409">Those acquittals were final and were not subject to redetermination.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.721" offset="2197337">The issue preclusive effect arises from the jury's acquittals, not from the hung counts, the hung counts which were not final and which resolved nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.742" offset="6037441">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Two separate lines of double jeopardy analysis lead to the conclusion that the government can retry hung counts that occur in a verdict simultaneously with acquittals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.455" offset="6096269">The first is the principle that the government may, under the doctrine of continuing jeopardy, try to obtain a verdict when a jury is hung.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.232" offset="6135348">The basic principle there is that the government is entitled to one full and fair opportunity to convict and that the hung counts, when the jury cannot agree, interrupt and prevent the government from achieving that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.414" offset="6184145">Double jeopardy, therefore, does not bar the government from completing its opportunity to obtain a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.691" offset="6209223">The second doctrinal line is that which grows out of the Powell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.455" offset="6232315">Collateral estoppel is premised on the idea that the jury has acted rationally.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.527" offset="7844592">The first is that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not aimed at preventing the government from attempting to bring its -- all of its charges in one indictment against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.867" offset="7881895">What the collateral estoppel component is aimed at is the government going sequentially, carving its prosecution up into pieces, and trying in different attempts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.189" offset="7923169">But isn't -- isn't the real problem that -- that you raised by your answer the following problem: That in this age in which there are, as Justice Breyer's hypo suggests, lots of overlapping criminal statutes -- you can indict not only for drugs but for telephones, and I don't know what other overlapping crimes there -- there may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.867" offset="8025882">Therefore, that gives the government by joining a lot of overlapping charges or lots of charges with common elements in either one indictment through various counts or simply by a series of indictments to be tried together -- it gives the government a bigger chance of getting a hung jury or some irrational resolution on some of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.420" offset="8140089">And if the government can bring loads of counts, increase the likelihood of getting a hung jury on one issue or one indictment, the government in effect has a key to avoiding just what Justice Breyer's hypothetical suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.616" offset="8208948">If they wait and bring the second count in June, there's an issue preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.625" offset="8232981">But if they bring it together, they've got an irrational verdict, and there's no issue preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.017" offset="8258476">Therefore, isn't the policy behind both double jeopardy and the issue preclusion extension a policy that argues in favor of saying, don't let the government have all these bites at the apple, because in fact it results or can result in seriatim prosecutions?</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.487" offset="8372370">There is, of course, the interest that Your Honor has identified, but the countervailing interest is that the government should have one full and fair opportunity to convict a defendant on charges that have been preferred by a grand jury on a showing of probable cause, and that does not occur when the hung counts deprive the government of that one opportunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.389" offset="8599949">But more fundamentally, I think that the number of counts in this indictment should not lead the Court to think that this was a case in which the government overcharged in some nefarious effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.336" offset="8647805">First of all, nefarious efforts like that tend to backfire on the government, and that's why sound prosecution policy dictates against overcharging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.536" offset="8684586">Here, I don't think it's fair to regard the number of counts as a proxy for overcharging, and that is because they break up into logically distinct units.</text>

            <text syncTime="2805.718" offset="11329327">And the jury instructions advised the jury that it had to find that he participated in the scheme and that he either made the statements or caused the statements or omissions to be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.274" offset="13527583">So it isn't necessary to treat the jury's hung counts as if they are verdicts of a sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.225" offset="13551303">They simply are data which show that if the jury had been rational and it had resolved a fact in favor of the defendant that was necessary for the government to prove on the other counts, it would have resolved those as acquittals as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.524" offset="13664569">The Solicitor General has essentially asked this Court to take a metaphysical view of the Double Jeopardy Clause, but the teachings of this Court from Sealfon through Ashe is that the important protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause as applied to issue preclusion must be approached with reason, with rationality, with a non-hypertechnical view in order to protect the public policies that underlie the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.637" offset="13801033">And that is quite simply that what happened here should not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.522" offset="13820573">That a defendant should not be forced to relitigate before a second jury an issue that was necessarily decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.909" offset="13858085">I sat through and argued through a 13-and-a-half-week jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.142" offset="13878983">A reasonable and rational explanation of what occurred there is that we had a conscientious jury that followed its instructions, that tried to reach through a complex 176-count indictment, and they simply were not able to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.214" offset="13947319">They spoke the community will, and they spoke it forcefully in their acquittals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.008" offset="13974486">And the only conclusion that can be reached from those acquittals is that Mr. Yeager did not possess insider information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.241" offset="14011371">At the beginning of this trial, we filed two motions, the first challenging the specificity of the indictment, and the second seeking a bill of particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.641" offset="14045017">The district court answered both with the same answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.530" offset="14056615">The insider information that Mr. Yeager is charged with possessing in the insider trading counts is the false statements made by others at the 2000 analysts conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.356" offset="14107920">The omissions theory was not, as the Solicitor General submits, some afterthought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.742" offset="14137386">It was core to the government's prosecution, and it was core to the case.</text>
