            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Kennedy has the opinion of the Court this morning in Case 07-689, Bartlett versus Strickland.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="7.789" stopTime="431.424">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.789" offset="137634">This is an opinion in answering the judgment of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.017" offset="150486">The case arises under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.846" offset="169817">Section 2, the statute, prohibits practices imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.529" offset="228540">It is accepted law that Section 2 can sometimes require legislators to draw a district where a minority group is geographically compact and would constitute a numerical majority of the voting age population.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.884" offset="281934">In election law parlance, that's called a majority-minority district.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.015" offset="306489">Today's case involves a different kind of district, a so-called crossover district.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.786" offset="325611">In this kind of district, the minority population is not itself a numerical majority of the voting age population.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.588" offset="352778">And it can elect the candidate of its choice only with the help from white crossover voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.125" offset="378901">The question here in this case is whether Section 2 can ever require the creation of a crossover district.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.173" offset="407113">When the North Carolina General Assembly redrew its districts after the 2000 census, it drew House District 18 for the State General Assembly to split Pender and New Hanover counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.566" offset="456746">That created the district with an African-American voting age population of 39%, a larger voting minority than if Pender County had not been split, but still it was not a majority-minority district.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.982" offset="514424">Pender County and its Commissioners filed a suit against North Carolina state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.198" offset="535218">They alleged that District 18 violated the North Carolina Constitution, which prohibit splitting counties to draw legislative districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.519" offset="564475">The North Carolina voting officials answered that keeping Pender County whole and not creating the crossover district would have deluded the minority groups voting strength in violation of Section 2, the controlling federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.221" offset="623303">In the case of Thornburg versus Gingles, this Court established three threshold requirements for Section 2 liability and at issue here is the first so-called Gingles' requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.023" offset="666561">And it is that the minority group at issue be sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single member district.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.620" offset="708880">Because the African-American voting age population in District 18 is only 39%, the Supreme Court of North Carolina held that state officials could not satisfy the first Gingles' requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.194" offset="755169">The State Supreme Court ordered them to redraw the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.083" offset="770738">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.775" offset="777529">And today, we affirmed the State Supreme Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.425" offset="792158">The state voting officials were the petitioners in this Court argued that although these crossover districts do not include a numerical majority of minority voters, they nevertheless satisfy the first Gingles' requirement because they are effective minority districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.735" offset="853389">We conclude the petitioner's theory is contrary to the text of Section 2 and to the reasoning of our cases in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.295" offset="883587">Allowing crossover district claims has a mandatory requirement under the statute would require us to revise and reformulate the Gingles' threshold inquiry that has been the baseline of our Section 2 jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.243" offset="935414">We find support for the majority-minority requirement in the need for workable standards and sound judicial and legislative administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.351" offset="971880">The rule draws clear lines for courts and legislators alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.706" offset="993301">The same could not be said of the less exacting standard that would mandate crossover districts under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.602" offset="1016811">Applying that standard would place courts in the untenable position of predicting many political variables and tying them to race-based assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.767" offset="1057562">We must be most cautious before interpreting the statute to require courts to make inquiries based on racial classifications and race-based predictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.465" offset="1096328">The statutory mandate petitioners urge us to find in Section 2 raises serious constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.147" offset="1127048">Heightening these concerns is the fact that Section 2 applies nationwide to every jurisdiction that must draw lines for election districts under state or local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.825" offset="1165709">Crossover district claims will require courts to make predictive political judgments not only about familiar two-party contests in large districts, but also about regional and local jurisdictions where political data are nonexistence and any predictions would be speculative at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.162" offset="1235090">Given the text of Section 2, our case is interpreting that provision and the difficulty of assessing Section 2 claims without the objective guidance of the majority-minority rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.323" offset="1275737">It is no surprise that every federal court of appeals to consider the question has interpreted the first Gingles' factor to require a majority-minority standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.921" offset="1322130">To the extent there is any doubt where the Section 2 calls for the majority-minority rule, we resolve that out by avoiding serious constitutional concerns under the Equal Protection Clause, which permits racial classifications only as the last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.609" offset="1380854">If Section 2 were interpreted to require crossover districts throughout the nation, it would unnecessarily infuse race into virtually every redistricting and would result in a substantial increase in the number of mandatory districts drawn with race as the predominant factor motivating a legislator's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.068" offset="1458698">Now, although we hold that Section 2 does not require crossover districts, our holding does not affect the availability of such districts as a matter of legislative choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.371" offset="1499972">Section 2 allows States to choose their own method of complying with the Voting Rights Act and that may include drawing crossover districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.400" offset="1532050">States that wish to draw crossover districts are free to do so where no other prohibition exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.772" offset="1553575">And because this case does not involve allegations of intentional and wrongful conduct, our holding does not address a situation in which a State intentionally drew district lines in order to destroy otherwise effective crossover districts, an act that would raise serious questions under both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.343" offset="1631838">Racial discrimination and racially polarized voting are not ancient history.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.001" offset="1658483">Much remains to be done to ensure that citizens of all races have equal opportunity to share and participate in our democratic processes and traditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.993" offset="1694427">It would be an irony, however, if Section 2 were interpreted to entrench racial differences by expanding a statute meant to hasten the waning of racism in American politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.884" offset="1745941">The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.336" offset="1759838">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Scalia has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.956" offset="1786274">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.876" offset="1809993">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion and Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
