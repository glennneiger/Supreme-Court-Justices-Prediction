            <text syncTime="8.554" offset="141688">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We are here today because the Oregon court failed to follow this Court's directions on remand and because the ground it gave is not adequate to show a forfeiture of due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="201979">This -- this Court vacated after finding that the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional standard, and it remanded with directions to apply the standard that the Court laid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.589" offset="249835">But the Oregon court didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.039" offset="259657">It never even addressed the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.141" offset="271987">The Oregon court, of course, refused to follow this Court's direction because it believed there were mistakes in another paragraph in our instruction request dealing with what the court referred to as "unrelated issues".</text>
            <text syncTime="54.301" offset="324650">But that isn't what this Court mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.187" offset="336248">And the specific forfeiture theory adopted here for the first time after nine years of appellate litigation is completely inadequate to avoid this mandate.</text>

            <text syncTime="84.337" offset="444813">And it was my understanding that a State court can resolve a case on an alternate State law ground, if there is such a ground in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="101.699" offset="514299">We believe that this disposition is quite inconsistent with what the Court mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.769" offset="534570">The Court heard arguments in this case about the "correct in all respects" rule, but it still mandated an application of the constitutional standard, including the prohibition on punishment for harm to nonparties, and that standard simply was never applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.612" offset="597891">We say that's inconsistent with this Court's opinion.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="125.581" offset="609802">But it seems to me the problem with the argument is that to say it's inconsistent with the opinion we implicitly have to say that the Oregon Supreme Court has to confront State law issues in a certain sequence, and that if it does not do so, those issues are waived, as it were, not only by the court but by the party who raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.644" offset="694021">And the difficulty, I think, with your position here is that on the assumption, which I do make, that the -- that the issue, "correct in all respect" issue, was properly raised by the other side, if we accept your position, we in effect are saying the other side is not going to have an opportunity to argue that before the Oregon Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.260" offset="784509">And that's, it seems to me, kind of a steep hill for you to climb.</text>

            <text syncTime="184.269" offset="844591">I know you are saying that but why -- why does the disposition that you are asking for not entail what I just said, and that is, in effect you cut off the claim by a party raised before the Oregon Supreme Court, not considered by the Oregon Supreme Court, and you cut off that claim simply because the Oregon Supreme Court chose to approach the issues in the case in a certain sequence?</text>

            <text syncTime="227.931" offset="1019193">But referring to that language simply skips over the issue that I am trying to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.118" offset="1043958">Isn't there a problem that we should be concerned with if we accept your position in cutting off the claim made by one party to the case which was never heard by the Oregon Supreme Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="247.843" offset="1098815">Well, Your Honor, this is very similar to what occurred in the Sullivan case in this Court, where the issue of preservation was debated before this Court at the cert stage in the cert papers, and the Court said: We sub silentio passed on the adequacy of the State ground when we GVR'ed the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.551" offset="1241652">Suppose it had said, well, we don't have to deal with whether Instruction 34 was right or wrong in this particular, because it was wrong in other respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.609" offset="1289927">Suppose that had been the first time around what the Oregon Supreme Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.763" offset="1314482">Would that have offended any Federal due process?</text>
            <text syncTime="306.299" offset="1332663">Would that have been an appropriate disposition for the Oregon Supreme Court to make?</text>

            <text syncTime="319.824" offset="1386789">And we say that -- that there are really three reasons why that would not be an adequate ground for forfeiting this valuable constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.955" offset="1575288">I realize it's a Federal law question, and in approaching that question, I keep asking the question which I think I have now put to you three times and have yet to hear an answer on the merits on: Why is it appropriate for us to have a rule here that cuts off the right of a party that properly raised an issue in the Oregon Supreme Court and has yet to be heard on the merits in the Oregon Supreme Court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="389.904" offset="1667135">Well, there are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.620" offset="1673927">First under the adequacy decisions of this Court, including Lee v. Kemna, if it takes years and years after the trial to articulate a forfeiture rule like this, that counts heavily against the adequacy of the State ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.930" offset="1731187">This Court held that in Lee v. Kemna very recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.632" offset="1741949">And then secondly, this is a point that was argued to this Court four -- three -- four separate times now, and when the Court remanded with explicit directions to apply the constitutional standard, that's something that had to be done on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.726" offset="1802344">The Court did not invite the lower court to get into the question of whether this request was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.612" offset="1825959">The Court found that the request was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.731" offset="1834423">Maybe -- maybe this Court insufficiently appreciated the significance of the issue which is now before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.818" offset="1858769">And I still want to know, is there a good reason on the merits why it is fair for us to cut off the right of the other side to raise an issue that they raise or to argue an issue that they raised in a timely fashion?</text>

            <text syncTime="454.495" offset="1925433">Yes, there is a good reason, because this is -- adequacy is ultimately a Federal question for this Court to decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3480.033" offset="14027651">If you look at those cases, you'll see there were simple instructions proposed on a single topic that were infected with an error throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.205" offset="14060251">And the court said if there is any valid proportion of this instruction, it was covered by something that was said to the jury already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.943" offset="14087210">So there was no harm in not giving that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.328" offset="14096823">That is certainly not our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.763" offset="14102570">We have a separately numbered paragraph dealing with the Constitution, which is quite apart from the statutory factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.689" offset="14166204">If you read that instruction, far from providing the protection that the -- this Court said was obligatory, it invited global punishment.</text>
