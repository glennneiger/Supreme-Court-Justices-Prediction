            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="7.985" offset="138365">Thomas Goldstein was convicted of murdering at state court, but after many years of imprisonment, he was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.538" offset="164592">When federal court's found that his trial was infected with an important prosecutorial error, namely, the prosecution failed to turn over to the defense, information would have shown that an informant who was testifying was not reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.602" offset="228854">After he was released, Goldstein sued the prosecution seeking damages under federal civil rights laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.035" offset="258633">But he didn't sue the prosecutor's who prosecuted him with the trial, rather he sued their supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.637" offset="284965">And this was probably for a good reason, the reason he -- he probably didn't sue the trial prosecutors is that he couldn't because prosecutors enjoy an absolute immunity in such suits, whether they make mistakes or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.217" offset="343270">The reason for that immunity, which is well established in the law, was explained by Judge Learned Hand many years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.896" offset="378065">He said it has been thought in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.763" offset="437520">Now, the question before us here in this case is whether the same analysis and same conclusion, namely, absolute immunity also applies to the prosecutors who administer the office as well as to those who tried the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.431" offset="500214">We conclude that the same analysis and conclusion do apply in the circumstances present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.528" offset="528530">Now, what are those?</text>
            <text syncTime="107.101" offset="534800">Well, Goldstein's claim that the prosecution, his claim is that the prosecution's administrative failures here consisted of inadequate supervising, inadequate training and a failure to set up a proper information system that would have kept track of the government informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.643" offset="613063">Now, those three fault, all are faults that relate directly to the work and performance of prosecutor's at individual trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.708" offset="653291">In addition, a specific prosecutorial error at Goldstein's individual trial was an essential element of Goldstein's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.833" offset="693729">He couldn't win without showing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.365" offset="703864">Now, given these circumstances, we find that all of the considerations that support absolute immunity in the context of a trial applied to this case in equal force.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.457" offset="752243">And we consequently hold that the supervising prosecutors here enjoy absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.559" offset="780664">We explain all these further in our opinion if you'd like more explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.296" offset="799577">We reverse a Ninth Circuit determination to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.359" offset="815877">We remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.901" offset="822042">The decision is unanimous.</text>
