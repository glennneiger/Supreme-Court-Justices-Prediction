            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Thomas has our opinion this morning in case 07-1437, Carlsbad Technology, Inc. versus HIF Bio, Inc.</text>

            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="11.385" offset="150925">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and it's not nearly as entertaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.867" offset="200871">After respondent files a lawsuit in a California state court, petitioner removed the case to federal court and sought dismissal of the lawsuit's only federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.614" offset="251862">The District Court dismissed the federal claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.193" offset="282164">It then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1367(c)(3) which provides that a District Court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claim if it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction that would be federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.998" offset="401387">The District Court remanded the case to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.696" offset="416225">Petitioner appealed arguing that the District Court abused its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.450" offset="463245">The Court of Appeals concluded that appellate review of the District Court's decision was barred by 28 U.S.C. 1447 (c) and (d) which this Court has interpreted to preclude appellate review of remand orders that are based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.807" offset="548613">The Court of Appeals held that the appellate review bar applied in this case because the District Court's remand order could be colorably characterized as a remand based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.854" offset="616845">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.324" offset="622696">And in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.746" offset="648401">We conclude that a District Court's order remanding a case to state courts after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is not a remand based on a lack of jurisdiction for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1447 (c) and (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="156.167" offset="730112">Such remand orders are not based on the absence of jurisdiction but on a District Court's discretionary decision not to hear the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.913" offset="773057">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.445" offset="783193">Justices Stevens and Scalia have also filed concurring opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.005" offset="805449">And Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Souter has joined.</text>
