            <text syncTime="9.039" offset="141625">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Congress squarely addressed and unambiguously answered the first question in this case when it enacted the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.031" offset="201498">It authorized the Secretary to take land in trust for Indians, and it declared, as used in this Act, Indians were</text>
            <text syncTime="34.737" offset="244339">"members of any recognized Indian tribe now under Federal jurisdiction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="41.058" offset="269625">The word 1934 as it does every morning in this Court when the Marshal announces that "The Court is now sitting".</text>
            <text syncTime="54.218" offset="322288">When Congress said "now under Federal jurisdiction", it did not mean "then under Federal jurisdiction", but that is what the Government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.990" offset="361368">In fact, the word "then" is the antonym for "now".</text>
            <text syncTime="68.744" offset="380385">"Now" must be given its ordinary meaning, which the Government concedes on -- in its brief, is the date, effective date of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.035" offset="425524">In this statute, the term "now" and synonyms are used repeatedly throughout the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.308" offset="462618">The word "now" appears five times in the same sense throughout the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.962" offset="493234">The word "hereafter" is also used.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.180" offset="506190">The word -- the term "now" or "hereafter" is used three times; "heretofore" is used three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.019" offset="533462">I mention these things because the Congress that read and enacted the statute had a keen sense of the temporal nature of the terms used in the Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="133.151" offset="638056">--Of course, of course, Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.753" offset="644430">There are many contexts in which one could conceivably, but the context would tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.824" offset="668672">In fact, the Government's -- one of the Government's examples is the use of the word "now" in a will.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.727" offset="688316">Of course, everyone knows the will speaks as of the date of the passage of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.481" offset="715379">There's another reference in the statute where the Government refers to that, and the statute itself has a very clear, different meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.587" offset="751741">My reference to the statute and the use of the word "now" in this statute is very, very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.974" offset="777341">The legislation -- the statute refers to legislation "now pending".</text>
            <text syncTime="173.045" offset="797612">That had to mean 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.914" offset="805031">It refers to boundaries "now existing or hereafter established".</text>
            <text syncTime="180.466" offset="827288">It refers to positions and Indian tribes "now or hereafter created".</text>
            <text syncTime="185.852" offset="848812">It refers to lawsuits "now pending or hereafter filed".</text>
            <text syncTime="191.423" offset="871069">It refers to tribes "now under Federal jurisdiction".</text>
            <text syncTime="195.041" offset="885593">All of those uses of the word "now" are consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.612" offset="899908">If the Government was correct, the word "now" would have no meaning in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.147" offset="917985">I think it was interesting, if one takes the question presented as articulated by the Government, it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="212.503" offset="955392">"Whether the Indian Reorganization Act authorizes the Interior Secretary to take into trust on behalf of an Indian tribe that was not recognized -- a not recognized Indian tribe under Federal jurisdiction on June 18th, 1934. "</text>
            <text syncTime="229.898" offset="1024982">if you take that word "not" and strike it out of the question presented, you get the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.618" offset="1051941">So, what the Government is asking for is the exact opposite of what the statute clearly requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.891" offset="1080989">And all one has to do is look at the question presenting -- presented as--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="248.026" stopTime="257.984">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="248.026" offset="1097498">What about -- what about the additional definition in section 19 of "tribe", which is not limited the way the first sentence is?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="257.984" stopTime="387.167">
            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="257.984" offset="1137309">--But it says, Chief Justice Roberts, it says "Indian tribe".</text>
            <text syncTime="262.620" offset="1155908">And the word "Indian", in that very section, at the very beginning of the section, says</text>
            <text syncTime="268.506" offset="1179418">"the term "Indian" as used in this Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="270.475" offset="1187359">blah, blah, blah.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.875" offset="1192897">So then, later in that same section, it refers to "Indian tribe".</text>
            <text syncTime="276.112" offset="1209825">It's important to juxtapose section 5, which is codified as 465, and section 19, which is codified as 479, to look at the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.705" offset="1268234">The first part of section 5 authorizes the Secretary to take land for Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.693" offset="1292163">Now, the way the Government addresses that in the Government's brief, they took the word 465 and said the statute authorizes taking land for tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.750" offset="1340437">It actually says taking land for Indians, and then in the latter part of section 5, it says "title" --</text>
            <text syncTime="315.570" offset="1367709">"When property is taken for Indians, title may be vested in an individual Indian or in a tribe. "</text>
            <text syncTime="322.843" offset="1396757">Then when you get to section 19, Congress very carefully said,</text>
            <text syncTime="327.878" offset="1416923">"As used in this Act, the term "Indian" shall mean. "</text>
            <text syncTime="331.180" offset="1430089">what we've been talking about here today, and that's an adjective that describes "tribe" later in the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.084" offset="1453808">There's two things that the Government does in their brief which I find very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.305" offset="1470631">First of all, the Government says the use of the word "Indian" doesn't necessarily mean Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.625" offset="1491947">But Title I, section 1, of the United States Code, the first sentence in the United States Code, says:</text>
            <text syncTime="355.231" offset="1526324">"The word "singular" -- The word "singular" shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the word "singular". "</text>
            <text syncTime="361.635" offset="1551924">So the United States is disregarding that maxim.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.087" offset="1565717">Of course, the context can always indicate something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.372" offset="1578883">But the Government asks you to ignore the singular or plural.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.026" offset="1597482">And then the other thing that the Government does is to ask you to understand that the word "Indian" means something when it's a noun and something else when it's an adjective, violating another primary construct -- construction, statutory construction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="387.167" stopTime="408.997">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="387.167" offset="1654115">Doesn't it have to be correct because in -- in section 19 it says that the term "Indian" means, among other things, all other persons of one-half or more Indian blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.610" offset="1707823">Now, the use of "Indian" there can't be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.962" offset="1721302">It would be circular if that definition applied to the use of that adjective there.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.032" offset="1745544">I understand that, Justice Alito, and -- and no statute, if you -- if you come along 70 years later, is it not possible to find something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.638" offset="1783996">But the fact is that the only consistent way to look at that term throughout the statute -- and I would say, first of all, it's the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.660" offset="1828091">It's the context of the words in the statute where the word "Indian" has to mean certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.730" offset="1852332">It has to have some limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.282" offset="1858497">Otherwise, the Secretary can do anything, and -- and Congress certainly didn't intend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.151" offset="1878037">It's not just the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.469" offset="1887336">It's the purpose for the statute, which was to protect and remediate Indians and Indian tribes that have been harmed by the allotment policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.740" offset="2328388">Congress decided, the United States decided, in the '30s that that policy had been -- ill-served the Indians and ill-served the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.180" offset="2362138">So the Indian Reorganization Act was intended to address and remediate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.732" offset="2380319">At the same time the United States was concerned and the Congress was concerned that there had to be some limit.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.559" offset="2843627">Now, the Federal Register and Federal records in 1934 were not what they are today, and that's the reason why, when these words were used, the Interior Department set about to look through the history of the Interior Department and to come up with a list of tribes that would have been covered, would have been embraced, by that term now recognized in 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="760.357" offset="3146856">In fact, in the Government's brief, the Government talks about three tribes for which land was taken into trust that didn't fit the definition of now recognized -- tribes recognized in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.450" offset="3207252">We went back and looked at two of those three tribes where -- in fact did have treaties with the United States and would have been included.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.248" offset="13922367">Let me start with Justice Kennedy's question, and I think one other justice asked about other canons of construction, specifically with respect to sovereignty of States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.521" offset="13967506">This Court said in Vermont Agency in 2000 if Congress is to alter the constitutional balance between States and the Federal government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear; and Justice Kennedy, I think you asked that question in the context of the relationship between States and Indian tribes, and I would refer the Court to Seminole Tribe, in which the Court said the Congress must unequivocally express its intent to abrogate States' immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.040" offset="14089550">As the Chief Justice was pointing out, this is a very broad grant of authority, if it is what the government says it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.544" offset="14119643">The Secretary can take property from the State, particularly a small State like Rhode Island, but it would be the same anywhere, and strip the State of jurisdiction and give jurisdiction to a dual sovereign operating within that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.704" offset="14176277">We submit that the legislative history, the legislative language, the legislative purpose, the contemporary construction of the statute by the author of this statute, and everything stands for the proposition that there was some limitation intended here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.428" offset="14231134">I think the Government overlooks the fact and it somewhat misstates it by saying land may be taken for tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.700" offset="14260182">I've heard that several times not just in the brief but during oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.152" offset="14274079">Section 5 which is the grant of authority says the Secretary is authorized to take land for the purposes of providing land for Indians and then section 19 defines the term Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.912" offset="14333116">Now it may -- once it decides that it may take title it may take land for Indians, it can then vest the title in -- as it says at the end of section 5 -- in individual Indians, individual Indian or tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.271" offset="14398527">But it takes lands for Indians; they have to be Indians or land cannot be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.973" offset="14417335">The other canons of construction, besides the ones that must recognize State sovereignty, is that words must be given their ordinary meaning absent a contrary context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.364" offset="14462892">Words are not to be considered to be superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.983" offset="14473341">There are several instances of efforts to repeal by implication in the Government's brief; and I could go on and on.</text>
