            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">I have our opinion this morning case 08-6, District Attorney's Office versus Osborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.252" offset="136464">The question presented in this case is whether there is a constitutional right to access DNA evidence outside of a state's established procedures for providing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.190" offset="176274">The respondent, William Osborne was convicted in Alaska state court of kidnapping, sexual assault, and other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.650" offset="206054">The appellate courts reviewing his conviction found no errors at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.421" offset="225176">Years later, Osborne filed this federal lawsuit seeking access to biological evidence from the crime scene so that he could subject it to DNA testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.456" offset="265300">After two rounds of litigation, the Court of Appeals held that he had a constitutional right to DNA testing under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.594" offset="297796">We granted certiorari to review that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.522" offset="313574">DNA testing has an unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted and to identify the guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.871" offset="342936">The question is how to harness DNA's power to prove innocence in the established criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.209" offset="368327">Answering that question is a task that belongs primarily to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.869" offset="386926">46 states and the Federal Government have already enacted statutes dealing specifically with access to DNA evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.067" offset="419736">These laws recognize the value of DNA testing, but also the need for conditions on accessing the state's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.545" offset="449620">Alaska is one of the handfuls of states yet to enact specific DNA testing legislation, but Alaska courts are applying existing discovery procedures to this noble technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.895" offset="495073">Alaska gives prisoners a right to be released if they make a sufficiently compelling showing that they are actually innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.442" offset="525270">Alaska also provides procedures to vindicate that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.698" offset="542302">There is no time limit on bringing an actual innocence claim under Alaska law, and there are procedures for accessing evidence to support an actual innocence claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.296" offset="584620">Alaska courts have ruled that these procedures include access to evidence for DNA testing in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.052" offset="615654">There are some restrictions on access similar to the ones provided by federal law and the laws of other states, but we see nothing inadequate about those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.317" offset="660689">In addition to challenging the adequacy of the state's procedures, Osborne makes a far more reaching argument that substantive due process requires us to recognize a free standing right to DNA evidence outside of the state criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.064" offset="727771">That is an unprecedented and sweeping approach considering whether to accept that approach largely turns on two different conceptions of the role of the federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.973" offset="771344">Under one view, the federal courts should generally allow Congress and the states to confront new technological problems and they should be hesitant to intervene in short circuit a prompt and considered legislative response.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.987" offset="819409">In contrast, under Osborne's view, the federal judiciary must leap ahead constitutionalizing the issue and taking it away from the democratic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.613" offset="857966">We favor the more restrained course. Congress and the states are actively legislating in the area of DNA testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.857" offset="886909">46 states and the Federal Government have already passed laws on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.741" offset="906449">At the end of the day, there is no reason to think that the federal judiciary would handle the issue more wisely as a matter of constitutional law when state courts and legislatures are doing as a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.621" offset="953992">Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, we reject Osborne's substantive due process claim. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.174" offset="1008118">Justice Alito has filed a concurring opinion which Justice Kennedy has joined and which Justice Thomas has joined in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.617" offset="1037897">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justices GInsburg and Breyer have joined and which Justice Souter joined in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.322" offset="1068722">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
