            <text syncTime="9.855" offset="145889">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is narrowed to a single, but from the Petitioner's perspective a critical, dispute over the scope of internal State sovereignty: whether the First Amendment trumps the otherwise existing authority of the Idaho legislature to direct political subdivisions of the State to take an action, here restricting access to their payroll systems, that the subdivisions could take independently without violating the Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.217" offset="323312">The genesis of this dispute is Idaho Code Section 44-2004(2), which was adopted in 2003.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.989" offset="366362">That provision prohibits State and local government public employers from deducting amounts for political activities from the payroll checks due to their employees and remitting those amounts to third parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.050" offset="966656">In this instance, the -- the legislature concluded that it wanted all public employers, among others, to not allow access to their payroll systems.</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.935" offset="7518166">First, the statute at issue is a content-based restriction on speech which is therefore presumptively invalid, requires heightened scrutiny, which Petitioners acknowledge they have not satisfied, unless one of the exceptions to heightened scrutiny is applicable here, those being exceptions which as the Court has explained in R.A.V. and Davenport, are limited to circumstances where there is no real risk of viewpoint suppression.</text>

            <text syncTime="1881.252" offset="7631433">Mr. Collins, suppose -- I gather Idaho doesn't have it, but suppose Idaho wanted a Hatch Act similar to the Federal Hatch Act that prohibits Federal employees from engaging in political activity, and suppose it decided that not only should the State employees at the capital not engage in political activities, but it's a problem for any governmental employee to do that; they ought to be neutral and we don't want patronage to be passed out on the basis of whether they are campaigning for one party or another, and we don't want them to be coerced into campaigning for one party or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.816" offset="7809693">Now, I assume that such a law would violate the First Amendment if it were extended to all employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.506" offset="7844488">Saying no -- no company employee, no private employee can engage in political activity would surely violate the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2080.464" offset="8428272">The answer to the second question is that our contention is not that the State is never a proprietor and never entitled to the kind of deference that goes with the proprietor when it's dealing with local government programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.307" offset="8491698">As the Court noted in the Council of Greenberg case, a government can become a proprietor with respect to property or programs it doesn't actually own.</text>

            <text syncTime="2163.499" offset="8760445">So, we have a content-based restriction, and the question is: Can it come within an exception to the heightened scrutiny that Petitioners acknowledge they can't satisfy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.723" offset="8805376">But when I'm suggesting that the State could come within reduced scrutiny if it were actually managing the payroll system, I'm referring to situations like Council of Greenburg, where the government with respect to a particular kind of facility or program says, we don't own it, but we -- it's an integral part of a system that we are managing, establishing, not just saying -- not just to say all we care about is one kind of speech we don't want to go on there.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clay Riggs Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="3739.183" offset="15063165">Two points that I think are critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.421" offset="15080093">First, the concession with respect to the State government employees based on Regan it itself entails a concession as to the reasonableness and the due point neutrality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.680" offset="15137144">Two, Respondents' theory of government with respect to the legislature having to speak in some kind of specific term, we would suggest, ignores -- would ask this Court to create entirely new case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.892" offset="15209974">But it also ignores in this situation the fact that the Idaho legislature contributes in 2006-2007 about half of the funds used by school districts in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.568" offset="15268697">And over 80 percent of those funds that go into what is known as a general maintenance and operations fund from which salary compensation is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.257" offset="15311433">Thank you.</text>
