            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1090, Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, and the consolidated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.404" offset="136067">Mr. Franklin.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="8.404" offset="140037">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Acting with express statutory authority and in furtherance of important foreign policies following the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, the President made inapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of law that had applied to countries that sponsored terrorism.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.448" offset="212240">Under the plain language of the statute, those provisions included former section 1605(a)(7), which was a provision of law that applied only to such countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.339" offset="251841">Because section 1605(a)(7) was madel inapplicable as to Iraq effective on the President's determination, it cannot now serve as the applicable statutory basis for abrogation of Iraq's foreign sovereign immunity and therefore subject matter jurisdiction in this case.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="53.551" offset="320700">Mr. Franklin, even if you are right about that, the legislation was an emergency measure with a sunset.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.756" offset="361451">It was revived for 1 year, but then no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.477" offset="380364">So, didn't this suspension of Iraq's lack of immunity -- didn't the immunity come back?</text>
            <text syncTime="82.468" offset="436266">Didn't the bar to immunity come back again once the emergency law sunsetted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jonathan_s_franklin" startTime="89.641" stopTime="249.628">
            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="89.641" offset="465000">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.808" offset="469703">The language of the sunset provision to which you are referring states only that the authorities contained in the section would expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.664" offset="497079">That means the authorities to the President given to him to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.449" offset="512230">Congress did not say that the effect of what the President had done would be nullified once his authority to act had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.935" offset="542218">And it's important to recognize that the President not only made inapplicable provisions of law addressed to state nations that had sponsored terrorism, but he also suspended the Iraq Sanctions Act under the same authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.195" offset="591224">The Iraq Sanctions Act has never been repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.862" offset="601882">So, if it were correct that the -- that the -- everything that the President had done became nullified upon the expiration of his authority to act, then the Iraq Sanctions Act would not only currently be in effect today, but would have been in effect since September 30th, 2005.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.341" offset="671786">And if there's -- that is not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.644" offset="685056">The Iraq Sanctions Act has a huge panoply of sanctions, both dependent on and independent of the legislative determination of Iraq as a state sponsor of terrorism.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.064" offset="718702">But if there's any question about this, when Congress acted again, the same Congress acted in 2003 to extend the expiration date, Congress -- the -- when that Congress acted, the legislative history said quite expressly that the extension was not necessary to extend what the President had already done, because that had already happened and that was permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.664" offset="805115">But it was necessary according to Congress for other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.782" offset="817549">So both because of the plain language of the sunset provision and because of what Congress subsequently did in 2003 to extend it, as well as the interpretation of the United States on this point, the President's actions didn't sunset.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.423" offset="872093">It was emergency legislation to be sure, but the emergency was to give the President the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.327" offset="895707">We were at war at that time and our foreign policy was changing 180 degrees almost overnight away from penalizing the government of Saddam Hussein as a state sponsor of terrorism, as an outlaw regime, and immediately towards helping the people of Iraq.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.789" offset="961640">And Congress gave the President the broad catch-all authority to, if he deemed it appropriate, to relieve the people of Iraq from all, not just some, of the very onerous restrictions and disabilities that had applied to them as a result of the prior regime's support for terrorism.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.666" offset="1033112">The President did this in exercise of his foreign policy judgment in order that the people of Iraq could better rebuild their country and establish a new democratic government that would in fact prove to become one of the United States' most trusted allies in a region that has not always had very many of them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="249.628" stopTime="261.370">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="249.628" offset="1105000">Well, what do you make of the fact that in -- in 2008 Congress said that that was never its intention, it was never its intention for the President to have the authority to -- to do this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jonathan_s_franklin" startTime="261.370" stopTime="332.665">
            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="261.370" offset="1151916">Two things, Justice Alito: The -- the first point is that this was not the Congress that acted in 2003.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.791" offset="1181592">This was a subsequent Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.525" offset="1188592">And that statement occurred almost 5 years after the legislation had been enacted and almost 3 years after the President's authority to act had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.949" offset="1238225">As such, that statement is nothing more than subsequent legislative history that cannot be determinative in deciding whether the President acted validly in 2003.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.091" offset="1286813">That determination should be judged according to the statute that was in front of the President when he acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.495" offset="1308442">But if there's any question at all in the Court's mind about the application of that provision, the President waived it.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.666" offset="1337072">He waived its application as to Iraq.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.716" offset="1345327">It is important to remember that the President would not sign the version of the NDAA that just had that provision in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.272" offset="1371554">He vetoed the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.038" offset="1378555">He vetoed it only because of its effect that it might have on Iraq, and he would not sign a replacement until he was given the authority to waive any and all of the provisions of section 1083 to the extent they may affect Iraq.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.282" offset="1431531">So if that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="332.665" stopTime="340.637">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="332.665" offset="1437069">Including -- including the provision that repealed 1605(a)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="338.351" offset="1459848">So that would be revived?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jonathan_s_franklin" startTime="340.637" stopTime="411.917">
            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="340.637" offset="1469043">--Well, we don't agree with that, Your Honor, because we think that the scope of the waiver would have been to make inapplicable or to waive application of extant provisions of law to the extent they might affect Iraq.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.461" offset="1524318">The President wasn't given the additional power to reenact statutes, to put a repealed statute back on the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.984" offset="1558382">The waiver was just like the EWSAA waiver, where the President was authorized to waiver with respect to Iraq existing privileges -- existing provisions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.942" offset="1598192">But again, to the extent there is any question about that, Title 1, U.S.C. section 108 answers that conclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.012" offset="1630480">That section provides that even if Congress itself had repealed section 1083 in its entirety, that would not bring section 1605(a)(7), which had been repealed by that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.105" offset="1686904">And that is the plain language of 1 U.S.C. 108.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.324" offset="1699756">Obviously the President by exercising a blanket waiver authority can't have a better or more effective ability to bring back into existence expired statutes than Congress itself could have done.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="411.917" stopTime="423.707">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="411.917" offset="1754091">Because technically it's just suspension, it's not -- it's not reenactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.154" offset="1775094">I suppose you could say a suspension is a partial revival, but the provision doesn't exactly fit, does it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jonathan_s_franklin" startTime="423.707" stopTime="466.068">
            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="423.707" offset="1801320">Well, we are talking here about a waiver applied to a repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.826" offset="1817725">I think the temporal point here is that the repeal happened effective upon the President's signature of the NDAA, on January 20, 2008.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.949" offset="1854192">That was already done.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.234" offset="1859417">The repeal happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.267" offset="1863492">At that point, section 1605(a)(7) no longer existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.455" offset="1880315">It was not in the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.088" offset="1886793">The President was authorized then subsequently to waive existing provisions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.459" offset="1912289">And here I think that this -- to allow the President to re-enact statutes according to a waiver authority is contrary I think to 1 U.S.C. section 108, but also common sense as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.534" offset="1964534">He was -- he was allowed to--</text>

            <text syncTime="466.820" offset="1973729">--Okay.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="467.403" stopTime="484.013">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="467.403" offset="1976027">Do we have any other instance in which a jurisdictional provision is withdrawn applicable to pending cases without Congress having mentioned the jurisdictional provision at all?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jonathan_s_franklin" startTime="484.013" stopTime="648.388">
            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="484.013" offset="2042483">Well, I think the closest analogy that I can give you, Your Honor, is in fact the precise circumstances we have here, and that is the doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.369" offset="2075920">Prior to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, determinations upon foreign sovereign immunity were made by the executive, and they had the effect, as the Court stated in the Republic of Mexico case and the Ex parte Peru, of requiring the courts to, quote, "surrender their jurisdiction", even if it had previously attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.301" offset="2163691">So here we have the precise situation that had always happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.019" offset="2178529">It had always been this way prior to the FSIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.038" offset="2190545">The President had always been able to make determinations on foreign sovereign immunity that would have the immediate effect of divesting the courts of their ability to hear cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.144" offset="2227012">Now, there were of course jurisdictional provisions at the time that conferred jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns, and the Court had no trouble -- and this was 150 years of practice, dating from Chief Justice Marshall's first recognition of sovereign immunity up until the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.205" offset="2299214">So this is actually not any different really than what had occurred before.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.842" offset="2321784">We have also cited numerous or several examples of jurisdictional statute that do depend on executive determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.513" offset="2348534">So there's really nothing particularly unusual about that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.817" offset="2365670">I would like to turn at this point, if I might, just briefly to our alternative argument in case the Court might find it relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.090" offset="2398793">This is an alternative argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.506" offset="2408511">It's not one that the Court needs to reach, but it is certainly another basis for reaching the same result in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.778" offset="2437559">And that is the simple fact in 2008 section 1605(a)(7), regardless of what the President had done previously to it, was repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.467" offset="2472354">And it was not just repealed, but it was repealed with a simultaneous bestowal of a replacement jurisdictional provision that encompassed every single pending claim that was then pending at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.359" offset="2523867">So this is the classic example of a jurisdictional repeal that applies to all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.846" offset="2545810">Congress didn't just repeal a statute, but it gave another provision that encompassed every pending claim and allowed every single pending plaintiff to be able to refile their cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.969" offset="2586352">Now, to be sure, the plaintiffs against Iraq were not able to exercise their ability under the new statute -- that is 28 U.S.C. section 1605(A) -- but the only reason they were not allowed to do that was the President's waiver, and the President's waiver was expressly made applicable both to pending cases and to preexisting claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.167" offset="2675064">So, for both of those reasons the alternative ground is also one that warrants reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.859" offset="2945902">Also, they are default judgments and so they are subject to all of the usual rules to the extent about reopening default judgments, not on the grounds of this sovereign immunity issue, but on the normal grounds of reopening of default judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.404" offset="3012044">So, to the extent there are such bases, I don't want to give up on those.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.772" offset="3025523">But we are not -- we are not making -- this argument's immunity argument today applies to these pending cases and the ability of courts to enter judgments, not to existing default judgments, but the execution on those judgments may well be affected by the arguments we are making today.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.548" offset="3088635">In the final analysis, I think this -- this is a case that turns ultimately on the President's exercise of his foreign affairs powers as delegated to him by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.690" offset="3133252">The Court has traditionally given the executive a fair amount of leeway and deference in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.827" offset="3153732">In this case I think that's particularly appropriate, given that these foreign policies are among the most significant facing the United States today.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.865" offset="3697915">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: EWSAA section 1503 authorized the President to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision of law that applies to countries that have sponsored terrorism.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.875" offset="3761967">The terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act falls squarely within the plain language of that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.314" offset="3791747">But if there were any question about that, certainly the President's exercise of his authority under that statute would be entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.103" offset="3830826">Even if one were to add the atextual additional limitation that the Acree court majority tried to, that it only encompassed statutes that would stand as an obstacle to the funding of the Iraqi regime in the aftermath of removing the Hussein government, still the President's memorandum to Congress makes clear his determination that the threat of billions of dollars of judgments against Iraq and the seizure or freezing of their assets by attachment constituted an immediate threat to the foreign policy interests of the United States and our critical foreign policy goals in Iraq.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.365" offset="4003861">I thought we were just told that because there -- of the limitations on enforcement, the -- there would be no realistic threat to the Iraqi assets in the United States because the judgment creditor wouldn't have access to them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Douglas Hallward-Driemeier</label>
            <text syncTime="994.410" offset="4084109">That is because of the authorities that the President exercised under the second proviso of 1503.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.766" offset="4109500">There are exceptions to the immunity of foreign states with respect to attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.051" offset="4130607">There is one that specifically applies to countries that have been designated as having sponsored terrorism, and that exception as well was rendered inapplicable to Iraq pursuant to this same authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.525" offset="4176583">And so, again, it is essential to the government's foreign policy interests in Iraq that these judgments, the ability to attach Iraqi assets -- in fact, at the time, in the summer of 2003, there were plaintiffs that were running around trying to attach the very assets, the very bundles of cash, that the United States Government was attempting to shift to Iraq in order to pay immediate needs in -- in Iraq in the immediate aftermath of having removed the Hussein regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.318" offset="4323704">These critical foreign policy goals would have been frustrated had the President not been able to make our Foreign Sovereign Immunity Law conform to our foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.291" offset="4371560">And, of course, the Court in Altmann recognized that foreign sovereign immunity is an expression of our present foreign policy interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.981" offset="4410326">That has always been the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.016" offset="4418476">And although Congress can establish the general rule, and did in the FSIA, section 1503 recognizes that there had perhaps never been as dramatic a transformation in our foreign policy with respect to a country as happened in the spring of 2003, whereas there had been a whole panoply of sanctions and other provisions of law that had applied to Iraq because of the Hussein regime's sponsorship of terrorism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.052" offset="4538640">On a -- on a dime, our policy shifted 180 degrees, and we became intensely concerned in the success of the new Iraqi regime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.458" offset="4680328">The judgment in the Acree case dismissing the claims for failure to state a claim was because counsel in that particular suit was unable to identify a source of law for their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.301" offset="4735603">The D.C. Circuit has correctly held that Federal law did not at that time provide a cause of action under 1605(a)(7), and counsel was unable when pressed at oral argument to identify the source of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.645" offset="4797043">But numerous district court judgments exist where the courts have upheld the availability of transitory tort under the law of the forum State, under the law of the residence of the plaintiff, or under the law of the -- of the place where the wrong occurred to provide a cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1201.295" offset="4911668">As I said, a number of these judgments apply the law of the forum State where the plaintiff resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.234" offset="4943329">The United States has expressed its view that there are constitutional limitations on the ability of a State to project its substantive law to a tort that occurs abroad, but -- but those issues have not yet I don't think have been resolved by the D.C. Circuit, at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.445" offset="5012187">So plaintiffs have successfully obtained judgments in suits brought under 1605(a)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.199" offset="5039250">And there were billions of dollars in claims that were asserted against Iraq.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.253" offset="5059417">And -- and, as I said, plaintiffs were actively going and trying to seek the actual money that the United States was trying to transfer over to Iraq to pay immediate costs of the reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.078" offset="5110721">But this does not mean -- and I think Justice Scalia's question was critical here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.315" offset="5135694">It does not mean that the plaintiffs are left without any remedy, rather that these plaintiffs have been put on the same footing as any other claimant against a foreign state that is not on the very small list of designated state sponsors of terrorism.</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.869" offset="6201908">And the point that I'm going to make from the text of the statutes is that the Solicitor General just correctly described to you what it was that Congress was trying to accomplish when he said that the structure of 1605 -- 1605(a)(7) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act says if you are the victim of torture by a nation designated as a state sponsor of terror and that designation changes so that you are no longer on that list, then you still have a cause of action under the FSIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.373" offset="6323952">The fact that the country changes its ways and gets de-designated doesn't change that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.361" offset="6343910">Now, what the Solicitor General says is that Congress changed that rule in 1503 and that's the debate in this case: Did Congress when it said that the President may make inapplicable various statutes which they say include section 1605(a)(7), did it change the basic rule about what the effect of a designation and a rescindment of a designation was, or instead was it giving the President a special power to remove the designation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.659" offset="6449131">If all it was doing was giving the power to the President to immediately rescind Iraq's designation as a terrorist state, if it was a more modest power rather than effectively writing into 1605(a)(7) 1605(a)(7) that the Solicitor General just cited to you, that changing somebody's designation doesn't affect their liability, would apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.679" offset="10557147">We have the debate over what any other means and does that include section 1605(a)(7).</text>

            <text syncTime="2684.092" offset="10842823">And something that applies to an -- statutes apply to countries that have supported terrorism under American law only in one way, through designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.031" offset="10874587">And what happens is that the President was allowed to rescind it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.108" offset="13402927">It is not the position of the Government of Iraq that in the very hypothetical instance in which something would change that they could not be redesignated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.896" offset="13434065">We believe they could be redesignated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.598" offset="13440857">We believe that is also the position of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.598" offset="13448798">When we say "permanent", we mean as opposed to just temporary.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3341.552" offset="13472622">I thought you'd say that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="3343.121" offset="13478891">--It is our position that it will be permanent because the Government of Iraq is now a very strong ally of the United States in the fight against terrorism, not a sponsor of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.144" offset="13515045">Just a few other points based on the argument that just occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.529" offset="13532599">They are interpreting the statute apparently now to say that the President only had the power to rescind the -- the previous designations, but that's not what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.754" offset="13577425">If that's what Congress had meant, they would have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.022" offset="13586516">They said "make inapplicable".</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.807" offset="13593621">And their entire case depends on that statute being applicable today because it serves as the abrogation of Iraq's sovereign immunity, and it serves as the predicate for subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.929" offset="13638134">It cannot be both applicable and having been made inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.067" offset="13654747">The other point that was mentioned -- and also I would also say in this regard that our foreign policy towards Iraq is different than our foreign policy towards other former state-sponsored terrorism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.939" offset="13698215">Libya, for example, was taken off the list, but there was an express requirement that Libya answer to the claims that were before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.362" offset="13723920">And, of course, that was because the -- the government that sponsored that terrorism, the -- the Khadafi Government, was still in power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.949" offset="13754222">Here we had gone into the country with U.S. military force aided by our allies, and we have ousted the regime, and we were seeking to support Iraq in its efforts to rebuild.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.954" offset="13790271">There was a point about the de-designation that was done in 2004.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.358" offset="13807825">The Secretary of State -- and it is cited on page 25 in the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.810" offset="13821722">The Secretary of State said in the de-designation that it was largely symbolic or perhaps a belt and suspenders, but he said it was largely symbolic in light of the prior EWSAA determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.535" offset="13868534">However -- and this is relevant to something else that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.487" offset="13880341">The de-designation was also necessary to allow military exports to Iraq because under the proviso 3 of the EWSAA, military exports were specifically exempted from the President's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.977" offset="13930392">That also shows that Congress knew how to make exceptions to the President's power when it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.365" offset="13951916">And, finally, I would say that we do agree with the analysis that Justice Souter has -- has posited, and that is that this involves a lesser power than the President could have exercised on his own authority to -- to completely espouse the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.641" offset="14017014">It, therefore, fits entirely within what is normally done in these kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.545" offset="14036658">And, Justice Ginsburg, it is also the position of the Government of Iraq that Iraqi victims ought to be included in any state-to-state diplomatic negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.817" offset="14073752">But that is a matter for the two governments to resolve between themselves, and that is one of the reasons why these kinds of claims have always been resolved in that manner in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.507" offset="14116488">They are reciprocal, bilateral concerns that affect two very close allies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.576" offset="14136759">Those governments ought to be negotiating and resolving those claims, whatever claims there are on both sides, between the two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.782" offset="14169569">If there are no further questions, thank you, Your Honor.</text>
