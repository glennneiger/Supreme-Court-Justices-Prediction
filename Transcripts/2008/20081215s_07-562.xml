            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Stevens has our opinion this morning in case 07-562, Altria Group versus Good and that will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="10.602" offset="147790">The respondents for many years, smokes cigarettes manufactured by the petitioners, cigarettes marketed by the petitioners as being light or low tar.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.146" offset="190004">In 2005, respondents filed suit in the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.793" offset="204633">The suit alleged that those cigarettes do not in fact deliver less tar than regular cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.808" offset="228665">It further alleged that petitioner's fraudulent concealment of that fact violated the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.571" offset="259699">In the District Court, the petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act as amended expressly preempts the respondent's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.907" offset="305048">The Labeling Act provides that no requirement or provision based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes that are labeled in conformity with the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.491" offset="359382">The petitioners also argued that respondent's claim is impliedly preempted because it is inconsistent with the Federal Trade Commission policy encouraging cigarette manufacturers' use of light and low tar descriptors.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.135" offset="421972">The District Court granted summary judgment for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.835" offset="436809">It concluded that the respondent's claim is expressly preempted because it seeks to require or prohibit certain statements in petitioner's advertising based on smoking and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.256" offset="478396">The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.264" offset="490517">It characterized respondent's claim as a fraud claim and so not based on smoking and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.604" offset="511833">The Court of Appeals held the claim is not expressly preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.244" offset="526357">It also rejected petitioner's implied preemption argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.784" offset="540568">It found no federal policy incurred in cigarette manufacturers to use light or low tar descriptors.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.000" offset="565436">We granted certiorari to address both the express and implied preemption questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.609" offset="587901">In an opinion authored by Justice Stevens, we now affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.066" offset="613710">16 years ago in Cipollone versus Liggett Group, the Court held that the Labeling Act did not preempt a common law claim that cigarette manufacturers had fraudulently concealed a material fact about their product.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.221" offset="670344">The state statute under which respondents in this case filed suit prohibits deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.891" offset="709005">Like the fraud claim in Cipollone, respondent's claim alleges a breach of the duty not to deceive, a duty that is not based on smoking and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.449" offset="743173">We now follow our disposition of the common law fraud claim in Cipollone in rejecting petitioner's argument that the similar statutory claim in this case is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.384" offset="778909">We also reject petitioner's contention that respondents' claim is impliedly preempted because it will present an obstacle to a longstanding policy of the FTC.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.629" offset="815898">Petitioners argue that the FTC has for decades promoted the development and consumption of low tar cigarettes and has encouraged consumers to rely on manufacturers' representations of tar and nicotine content.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.459" offset="863232">Our study of the regulatory history however, reveals no such policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.878" offset="880891">We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.850" offset="892803">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Alito have joined.</text>
