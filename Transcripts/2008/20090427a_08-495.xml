            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Moseley</label>
            <text syncTime="7.487" offset="135356">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At issue in this case is an aggravated felony definition, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), one that serves both as a ground of deportation and as an integral part of a Federal criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.131" offset="209962">For the Court's convenient reference, because I suspect we will return to this and the other definitions, I would refer the Court to the statutory appendix in the government's brief: 3a gives (M)(i); 6a gives the conviction requirement; and 7a to 8a gives the underlying criminal statute in which this aggravated felony definition forms an integral part.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.516" offset="307451">Now, Congress has required -- for deportation, Congress has required conviction of this defined offense, in a definition that says absolutely nothing about the word "tether" utilized by the Third Circuit below, and the definition begins with a restrictive clause, "that", to require conviction of both the fraud and deceit element and also the loss amount as an integral part of this definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.302" offset="426674">Since Congress required conviction, the time-honored categorical approach really should be the governing standard, and I submit that there's nothing in the plain language of the statute, the underlying statute enacted by Congress, to oust that time-honored approach, which I submit is perhaps on a par as being presumptively applicable, similarly to the -- to the stay standards that this Court discussed very recently in the Nken case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.659" offset="6044045">And I think it's also important here to note the structure of the act in terms of how Congress sharply distinguished between what would happen with conviction and -- and what would happen with sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.736" offset="6104336">They did enact specific provisions, 101(a)(43), subpart (F) at 2a of the statutory appendix and (G) at 2a of the statutory appendix, which talk about -- which -- which talk about sentencing and make that sharp distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1771.412" offset="7191030">Even if it were clear that it had nothing to do with a determination of guilt, that would be a particularly odd sort of bifurcation to thrust upon the original criminal proceeding, to require the jury to make findings about facts that are truly extraneous to the purposes of the criminal proceeding that is being held there, and for -- at least for guilt purposes, there is no reason for the jury to have to find that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.593" offset="7279741">And as -- as the questions before were making clear, the reason this Court has applied the modified categorical approach is to determine what is necessary for the underlying conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.948" offset="7317253">That's why it's tied to an investigation into what really were the elements of the underlying offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.019" offset="7337524">And interrogatories about facts that were not, in fact, necessary for the conviction or -- or extraneous facts that are introduced into guilty pleas do not change the fact that that particular attribute was not necessary for the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.095" offset="7393844">And so, we think that it makes sense, in context of the other definitions in paragraph 43 of the definition of aggravated felonies, where it is indisputable that there are multiple provisions that include both an element that needs to be evaluated as an element of the offense and some other limiting factor that need not be an element of the offense; that it makes sense to construe the loss threshold in subparagraph (M)(i) as something that need not be an element, because the consequences of Petitioner's approach would be to read out virtually all Federal fraud prosecutions, including such mainstays as mail fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the government, bank fraud, the offenses that were at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.672" offset="7560088">And he does offer a patchwork of some State offenses that could be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.076" offset="7585688">But even there, there -- there's not any particular consistency to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.497" offset="7611392">He invokes the Model Penal Code, which has a gradation scheme for theft by deception offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.133" offset="7633962">And although the BIA has -- has acknowledged that theft by deception offenses may in certain circumstances constitute fraud offenses, the Model Penal Code does not in the next chapter dealing with forgery and fraudulent practices have a consistent gradation scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.660" offset="7696029">So even in the States that Petitioner cites in his reply brief, Delaware doesn't have monetary thresholds for insurance fraud, even though it does for health care fraud; and New Jersey doesn't have monetary thresholds for credit card fraud or payment card fraud, and so a million-dollar fraud would not be -- would not be treated consistently, depending upon which State it was committed in and even which type of fraud it was in an individual State, if the State--</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.685" offset="7840120">Under the sentencing guidelines, the loss was a very complicated calculation, lots of rules about relevant conduct and lots of cases and different ways of proving loss, and here we just have the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2632.688" offset="10636163">I think that's something that can easily be established through the categorical approach and we would not need to have a 1326 to determine it's a felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.589" offset="13127826">We deal with a dual use statute which has both civil and criminal applications, so that under these circumstances, certainly as this Court held in Leocal and in Lopez-Gonzalez, Chevron deference with respect to Babaisakov would not -- for example -- would not be triggered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.816" offset="13200656">I think, moreover, it's important to note that the Babaisakov got (M)(ii) wrong -- got the -- the requirement of a deficiency wrong, and also got wrong the fact that there were no statutes involved where fraud -- where a loss amount in excess of $10,000 would be an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.047" offset="13281635">Finally, I think the government's reading of this statute might make sense if Congress had said that -- convicted of a crime in -- a crime in which fraud or deceit is an element, with loss to be found at removal proceedings in excess of $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.508" offset="13359480">But that's not the language that Congress employed here, and under these circumstances, even if the statute is perceived to be ambiguous, that ambiguity should be resolved in the Petitioner's favor.</text>
