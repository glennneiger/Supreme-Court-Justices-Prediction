            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">We'll hear argument this morning in Case 08-267, United States v. Denedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.702" offset="130299">Mr. Shah.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="pratik_a_shah" startTime="6.887" stopTime="106.049">
            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="6.887" offset="135001">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or CAAF, held that military appellate courts possess open-ended jurisdiction under the All Writs Act to entertain a coram nobis challenge to the merits of a final court-martial conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.764" offset="214518">This Court should reverse that decision, both because the All Writs Act cannot supply jurisdiction that Congress chose not to confer and because Respondent is a civilian who may no longer invoke the military court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.358" offset="268852">As this Court explained in Clinton v. Goldsmith, military courts, as Article I courts, are strictly limited to the bases of jurisdiction conferred upon them by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.599" offset="321829">Three related aspects of the UCMJ make clear that it does not confer jurisdiction over Respondent's coram nobis petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.438" offset="353176">First, as noted in Goldsmith, the UCMJ narrowly circumscribes military appellate jurisdiction to the findings and sentences of a court-martial conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.293" offset="396643">That is a direct review jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.261" offset="404480">UCMJ Articles 66 and 67, which define appellate jurisdiction, do not contemplate any further review within the military appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.117" offset="439902">Second, once direct appellate review is complete and the military authority executes the judgment, UCMJ Article 76 affirmatively forecloses any further military court review.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.342" offset="492878">As this Court has recognized on two prior occasions, UCMJ Article 76 marks the terminal point of proceedings within the court-martial system.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="106.049" offset="531644">Mr. Shah, how does that differ from the general rule that a judgment becomes final and has preclusive effect once the appellate route has been exhausted or the time to pursue it has expired?</text>
            <text syncTime="124.194" offset="604264">It seems to me that Article 76 simply codifies the rule that applies ordinarily in criminal cases, in civil cases, stating when a judgment becomes final for preclusion purposes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="pratik_a_shah" startTime="140.021" stopTime="198.773">
            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="140.021" offset="667585">Your Honor, yes, Article 76 does that, but it does more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.573" offset="689737">As this Court recognized in Gusik and in Councilman, it marks the end of proceedings within the military court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.911" offset="723069">Now, beyond the text, what this Court looked at in Gusik -- in Gusik, it was a Petitioner seeking habeas review.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.248" offset="744490">One of his alternative arguments in Gusik was that Article 76 essentially violated the Suspension Clause because it -- it marked the end of -- no further proceedings within the military court system as well as within the Article III court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.944" offset="811259">The Court agreed with the petitioner that Article 76 marked the end of any further proceedings within the military court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.300" offset="844696">It disagreed that it also effected a repeal of Article III habeas jurisdiction, but there was no disagreement between the petitioner, the government, and this Court in Gusik that it did mark the end of proceedings within the military court system.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="198.773" offset="902583">Therefore, one can say that that point wasn't decided in the case, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="pratik_a_shah" startTime="202.808" stopTime="227.423">
            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="202.808" offset="918674">Well, Your Honor, one could say that, but this Court again in Councilman ratified that line, that the Court drew in Gusik.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.312" offset="948767">It -- it reiterated the reasoning that Article 76 forecloses any further proceedings within the military court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.001" offset="979487">So I don't think it's just dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.436" offset="985234">It was relevant to its denial of the Suspension Clause claim, and the Court reiterated that in Councilman 25 years later.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.423" offset="1017208">Where, in your view, in that the government is putting forward, can this -- can Denedo go?</text>
            <text syncTime="239.648" offset="1066109">He said, I was misinformed by my counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.135" offset="1088052">I never would have entered a plea if I had known I would be subject to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.139" offset="1111980">And he said, I never found out about it until, what, 8 years later, when the government -- 8 years after his conviction, the government said, you're subject to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.715" offset="1162344">Where can he go with that plea?</text>

            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="267.417" offset="1177182">Your Honor, it appears that Respondent no longer has any further remedies to -- to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.487" offset="1201424">But we think the important point is that in a general -- in the general case, Petitioner is bringing -- the exact same claim the Respondent is bringing is normally going to have several avenues of remedy outside--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="286.145" stopTime="316.748">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="286.145" offset="1251997">We're assuming now, because we haven't gone any further than his plea, that he was so misinformed and he didn't lack diligence in failing to bring it earlier, that he was surprised by the government's action, so he was unaware and, therefore, unable to make this plea any earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.327" offset="1348754">You have given us the answer that it's too bad, he's just out of any court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="pratik_a_shah" startTime="316.748" stopTime="364.029">
            <label>Mr. Pratik A. Shah</label>
            <text syncTime="316.748" offset="1374459">--Well, Your Honor, I think it's important to note that the UCMJ marks the high-water mark of process within the military justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.770" offset="1410508">What the UCMJ did is it took the prior system, which didn't even allow for real direct review within the military court system, and it made that direct review system much more robust.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.763" offset="1462544">It added an intermediate court of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.881" offset="1474978">It took administrative review that was embodied within boards of tribunals that had typically been under the Judge Advocate General.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.202" offset="1500264">It moved that out and gave it greater independence to provide more robust intermediate appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.939" offset="1523252">It added an entire level of a new court, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which provided additional -- a new level of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.712" offset="1558361">And then it said still--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="364.029" stopTime="384.375">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="364.029" offset="1563585">Well, part -- part of independence is the assurance that the court has the ability to do justice in the case before it, and I think the purpose of coram nobis or coram vobis is to protect the integrity of the court, and that's all this court is asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.190" offset="1636206">So that's quite consistent with what you've just said.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="pratik_a_shah" startTime="384.375" stopTime="429.254">

            <text syncTime="384.375" offset="1644983">--Well -- well, Your Honor, in enacting the UCMJ, Congress was balancing several values.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.862" offset="1666926">On the one hand, it was balancing the rights of service members, but at the same time, it was balancing the important value of maintaining good order and discipline within the armed -- within the armed forces, mindful of the military's primary mission in fighting wars and defending the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.158" offset="1732127">Now, given those competing values, it was -- it was reasonable for Congress to draw a line at some point and say it, the conviction is final and to the extent you want to seek further collateral review, you have to go to the civilian system to seek that review.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.131" offset="1788029">That -- that line is reasonable not only from a historical standpoint, but also from a practical standpoint, given the institutional limitations--</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.799" offset="12818704">I don't read it that way, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.168" offset="12824137">I read it as channeling apt post-final attacks within the military -- within the courts in the military justice system, even though the person is -- is -- a final judgment typically happens before an individual is no longer in the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.345" offset="12884846">A final judgment is final because the discharge has been executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.213" offset="12896340">So what he's referring to is, once you have a final judgment, you then can seek collateral relief in the military the way you used to be able to do it in the correction boards in the military courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.604" offset="12941897">And he was saying, now that we're getting rid of this one collateral remedy in the correction boards, we're giving you this other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.924" offset="12967184">We're not giving -- we're just channeling all of them into the military appellate courts, which is a more appropriate judicial forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.828" offset="12994769">And he says clearly it would denigrate the courts to have administrative bodies overturning their judgments, once again showing that these are final judgments that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.618" offset="13033953">And the only -- that was the only premise he offered to make the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.653" offset="13046073">So stripping away one remedy while leaving another intact was the single premise, which is reflected in the House -- the Senate report on page 52 of our brief, where Congress adopts the exact language out of his sworn testimony with, you know, a tiny variation, but that's the premise for the change in the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.299" offset="13124650">I'd also note that, in that legislation, this is the Department of Defense proposing to open the door to this Court's jurisdiction for the first time in -- in 28 U.S.C. 1259.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.541" offset="13173656">And when it did that -- it had to survey the whole landscape of military justice jurisdiction, and when it did that, it saw there were direct review cases, which are reflected in 1259 paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, and then his other category that is defined by what's not in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, and that's the All Writs Act cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.565" offset="13529757">They're -- they remain within the service, and it's interesting that the government cites Mr. Taft's testimony as authoritative on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.806" offset="13566642">And that -- that makes good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.472" offset="13573329">Keep the person in for a direct review so that if their sentence is set aside, we can retry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.376" offset="13592973">But there has been decades of military justice authority that says even if someone is discharged before their conviction is set aside -- so they're on direct review, their conviction is set aside, after they're already out in their civilian world, you know, doing whatever they're doing -- if the government wants to retry them, they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.374" offset="13673012">And the government is -- is the party that asserts continuing jurisdiction to re-prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.576" offset="13689731">And that's why this case is so distinguishable from Toth v. Quarles, because in Toth there was no conviction while the individual was on active duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.515" offset="13721496">And that's why there couldn't have been a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.765" offset="13730482">Here there was conviction on active duty, which is where jurisdiction attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.585" offset="13745842">It cements in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.368" offset="13748976">And if the government wants to invoke that to retry Mr. Denedo, it can try that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.720" offset="13766322">I would say, though, that if -- if there were a personal jurisdiction loophole here, like there was for the MEJA, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, Congress could fix it in a heartbeat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.326" offset="13812820">But we're talking about, you know, 10 cases in 10 years.</text>
