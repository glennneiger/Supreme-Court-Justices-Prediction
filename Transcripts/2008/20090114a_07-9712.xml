            <text syncTime="41.327" offset="270775">The teachings of this Court in this situation are instructive.</text>

            <text syncTime="55.968" offset="329289">Isn't it a fact that after the plea bargain the defendant in essence broke his side of the bargain by committing a crime while he was in jail?</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="75.881" offset="408910">Well, I used to teach contract law and I'll tell you that would have been a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.868" offset="428868">That would have been a breach on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.418" offset="435137">Now, the government has conceded the breach of the plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.856" offset="452796">I don't -- I can't understand why they did that, but they apparently have conceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.241" offset="470350">Does that mean that we have to ignore it for purposes of deciding what the -- what the remedy is?</text>
            <text syncTime="97.628" offset="495950">Ignore the reality that there was a breach?</text>
            <text syncTime="102.381" offset="514968">I mean, you know, if the government said, we will ask the court to sentence at the lower end because of the -- the remorse that the defendant has shown, and the defendant then demonstrates that he has no remorse by -- you know, suppose he comes and stabs the judge -- is the government really supposed to have to go before the judge and say,</text>
            <text syncTime="130.349" offset="626772">"Your Honor, this man is really remorseful and you should sentence him at the lower end? "</text>
            <text syncTime="136.353" offset="650804">It seems to me it's a basic principle of contract law that a party to a contract cannot take action which makes it impracticable for the other side to carry out his part of the bargain, and that's what your client did.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.464" offset="715274">The government couldn't practicably go in and make that argument when he had demonstrated himself to be an unremorseful criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.404" offset="751010">--The government in this case drafted a plea agreement, and most plea agreements -- I've practiced in the Northern District of Texas quite often, and virtually every plea agreement has a provision in it that says if the defendant does some type of criminal activity, thus it will render it void.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.080" offset="813704">This plea agreement did not have that in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.149" offset="933972">Well, the questions so far indicate that one of the promises was an implied promise that you will keep the terms of the agreement by lawful behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.991" offset="977335">So that just -- what you say just begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.276" offset="990501">Now, I recognize the government has conceded a breach, and we will probably move on from that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.196" offset="1014220">But, as Justice Scalia indicates, it puts the case in a very artificial posture, it seems to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.606" offset="1067823">The bargain here was not that Mr. Puckett would get the points, but that the government would agree that he was qualified to receive those points.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.898" offset="7529054">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the government breaches a plea agreement, an objection made in the district court serves important purposes that relate to the functioning of Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.891" offset="7584956">It permits the district court and the parties to determine whether a breach has occurred, and it also, in many cases, may permit an immediate cure of that breach to be administered, obviating the need for appellate review of the issue altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.769" offset="7656532">A central purpose of the contemporaneous objection rule is to ensure that the district court proceedings are as free of error as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.792" offset="7692581">And that purpose is served in this context, the plea breach context, as it is in others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.546" offset="7715568">Rule 52(b) reinforces the contemporaneous objection rule by placing a heavier burden on the party who does not object in the district court to win relief on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.337" offset="7762798">The government's submission to the court today is that the plain-error standard does apply to forfeited claims that a plea agreement has been breached, that the Olano framework should be followed, and that one component of the plain-error showing in this context should require a defendant who did not object to a breach in the district court to show a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding was affected by the breach.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.257" offset="8302488">If the government does engage in some breach of the agreement, it seems to me the consequence is that an individual has given up a trial and as a consequence of that has given up liberty, without either the trial that he is entitled to or fulfillment of the conditions for giving up the liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.157" offset="8410008">And isn't there -- isn't there a very high value to be placed on the fact that nobody in the United States under the constitutional guarantees should be -- should be sitting behind bars without either a conviction following full trial, invocation of whatever rights he wants to invoke, or a voluntary agreement to be behind bars?</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.343" offset="8522752">And -- and when neither of those conditions is fulfilled, don't we have an error that as a matter of constitutional law cannot be regarded as harmless.</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.607" offset="8603836">And the Court there said that it was not -- at the very least, the Court said when the government has not fulfilled its promise and an objection is raised and the defendant has suffered an adverse consequence that was somehow related to the government's broken promise, that the Court is not going to find harmlessness simply based on the district court's statement itself that it didn't rely on what the government had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.693" offset="8724208">Now, we would submit, however, that there could be cases -- and the Chief Justice's hypothetical would have one of those -- where even in a setting where an objection is raised, if the defendant receives the benefit that was the aim of the promise he secured from the government -- for instance, if in Santobello the defendant there received the lowest possible sentence that he might have gotten -- that in that circumstance, Santobello should not preclude harmless error review, and the defendant cannot be said to have -- to be in jail having not received the benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2662.672" offset="10756117">On the other hand, you could argue that there is implicit, also, a promise not to implicitly do the first implicit, if what he has done in the meantime is commit another serious crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.183" offset="14218177">I think it's a hard question, burden of proof and these other things, that I just turned the page, after the person, Ms. Simms, she's the prosecutor, and she's absolutely clear to me, others can disagree, that this judge knew just what the government had agreed to, and the prosecutor was saying that now things have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.764" offset="14296440">And then the judge turns to the probation officer, and the probation officer says, just to reiterate what Ms. Simms said, the new offense, according to the guidelines of the guideline manual, prohibits any acceptance of responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.607" offset="14355895">Now, if that turns out to be right, of course, it couldn't matter less whose burden of proof it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3666.924" offset="14773123">The problem that the Puckett panel had in the third prong of 52(b) they focused on whether or not there is prejudice at sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.797" offset="14812620">That was the focus of the Puckett panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.566" offset="14823696">That is why they said 52(b) plain error applied and was found in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.302" offset="14842608">The problem with that is that Santobello clearly points out that prejudice to the trial judge, that the trial judge -- what the trial judge would have done is simply not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.443" offset="14891196">That is why 52(b) cannot be applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.329" offset="14906765">Secondly, when the government argues that there is no prejudice -- you have to show prejudice at sentencing, the judge would have done something different, that is virtually an impossible standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.453" offset="14951278">Under 18 U.S.C. 355 -- there are a number of factors a sentencing judge has to take into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.107" offset="14977818">The idea -- and there is many different factors they must look at, all of these different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.927" offset="14997149">The idea that a defendant can somehow show a judge would have come to a different result but for the government breach is an impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.498" offset="15027451">The final point I would make is, the argument the government is making now about prejudice, it would make no difference at all if the defendant had objected at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.489" offset="15071336">If there is no effect on sentencing, it would not pass muster under plain-error or the harmless error standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.995" offset="15101430">So the next case that is going to come before this Court is when you have an objection, and then they're going to say the exact same argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.149" offset="15134030">We would ask you to reverse the decision of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
