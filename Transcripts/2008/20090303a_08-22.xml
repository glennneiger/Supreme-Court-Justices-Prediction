            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="3440.665" offset="13869056">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.978" offset="13878356">Justice Scalia, you mentioned that the words "reasonable search and seizure" are in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.524" offset="13900507">The words "due process" are in the Constitution, and that is what we're talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.880" offset="13921928">And this Court has repeatedly said -- and I don't think my opponent objects or disagrees -- that due process means a fair trial in a fair tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.031" offset="13962574">So what are we talking about today?</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.343" offset="13971769">What is a fair tribunal?</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.590" offset="13980756">He said ask yourself, could you be fair if you were in Justice Benjamin's position?</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.934" offset="14006147">That, I submit, is not the question, because this Court has repeatedly said actual bias is something that's virtually impossible to prove, the Council of -- the Conference of Chief Justices said don't go there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.129" offset="14062989">We can't ever determine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.676" offset="14073125">And so the question is what is -- is someone likely to be biased, likely to be unfair?</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.454" offset="14104263">And, Justice Kennedy, one of the -- one of the factors that led us to the conclusion that an objective standard, that a reasonable person knowing all of the facts would probably be biased is language from a number of these court -- this Court's decisions, including your concurrence in the Liteky case -- I think it's Liteky, L-i-t-e-k-y -- in which you said the objective observer would entertain reasonable questions about the judge's impartiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.724" offset="14229337">Now, that's a case involving section 455 and not the Due Process Clause, but I think the logic with respect to the application of the test and the ability of this Court and other courts to apply it, as the Conference of Chief Justices said they could, is the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3583.403" offset="14440093">I mean, if your response to the first question is judges have lifetime tenure, you then can't respond to the second question would it make a difference if he was term-limited by saying, no, it wouldn't make a difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3596.057" offset="14490666">He might be -- he might need the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.537" offset="14500592">This was $3 million in a race in which that amounted to more money than everybody else collectively put into this race while this case was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.426" offset="14540194">Now, the language that I think is important is from the Tumey case:</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.188" offset="14559211">"Might not a defendant with reason say that he feared he would not get a fair trial? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.327" offset="14579796">So instead of the question that my opponent asks, would you be fair, which is not the standard because actual bias isn't the test, would there be a perception, likelihood, probability, appearance of bias, to use the language used by this Court over and over again?</text>
