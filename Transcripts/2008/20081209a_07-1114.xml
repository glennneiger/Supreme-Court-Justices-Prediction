            <text syncTime="8.856" offset="143966">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this case comes to the Court, two things I think are uncontested.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.426" offset="170193">The first is that, at this trial, the prosecution suppressed all the evidence in its files that went to the single most important contested issue of the case, and that's whether the defendant was a drug addict and committed the crimes in an amphetamine psychosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="227558">And the second is that, as soon as the Petitioner found out about the suppression, he presented his Brady claim to the State courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="37.473" offset="258382">There's also a third thing that's uncontested, which is there's no Brady claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.660" offset="279176">That's not at all included in your question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.529" offset="290565">The district court and the court of appeals concluded that there was no Brady violation on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="55.485" offset="330480">--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are a couple issues that you've raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.503" offset="342497">Can I first address the question of whether it's encompassed within the question presented on the merits?</text>
            <text syncTime="63.840" offset="363813">Because the question is, well, is this all just an academic exercise because the procedural default holding wouldn't change the ultimate outcome in the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="71.179" offset="393174">The answer is that it is, we think, fairly encompassed within the question presented, and I can explain why, including with respect to the text of the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.100" offset="424939">The court of appeals in this case disavowed deciding the merits of the Brady claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.820" offset="447822">And let me take you to the petition appendix, and that is at page 22a and again at 24a.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.830" offset="503829">So I'm just trying to walk you through what the court of appeals did.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.716" offset="515323">At the very top of 22a:</text>
            <text syncTime="103.317" offset="521801">"We therefore will not disturb our decision that Cone's Brady claims are procedurally defaulted and not before this court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="109.821" offset="547819">And then on 24a, at the bottom of the first full paragraph, the last sentence:</text>
            <text syncTime="116.875" offset="576031">"We again find that Cone's claims are procedurally defaulted and we reject Cone's request to reconsider his Brady claims. "</text>

            <text syncTime="125.531" offset="610617">On page 25a, they've been talking about those federalism issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.885" offset="628067">They say:</text>
            <text syncTime="130.468" offset="630366">"We need not be delayed by these interesting questions of federalism, however, because, in all events, the documents discussed in the dissenting opinion that were allegedly withheld are not Brady material. "</text>

            <text syncTime="141.776" offset="675610">I was not going to stop, and I was going to just point out the dilemma that I faced when I wrote the cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.827" offset="695777">So, on the one hand, they disavowed deciding it, and then quite clearly there are some -- there are a couple paragraphs there.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.214" offset="717302">You've -- you've stated one.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.000" offset="724511">The next paragraph does the same thing, talking about the merits of the Brady claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.052" offset="740707">So here's the dilemma that I faced in writing the cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.487" offset="750425">They say they're not deciding the Brady claim, but then they talk quite clearly about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.082" offset="2764779">But to your first point, we do identify what we think are clear legal mistakes by the lower courts in -- whether it's a holding or dictum, not to get into -- enter into that debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.604" offset="2806888">We explain that the Sixth Circuit avowedly split the evidence into sort of four different silos or categories, and we think inconsistently with Kyles v. Whitley, and we think the lower courts were wrong not to hold an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.565" offset="2870732">Now, those aren't fact-bound points; those are questions of law, so we believe that it would be perfectly appropriate for this Court to decide the procedural question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2372.341" offset="9597889">It seems to me there was a lawyer for the State here that twice told the courts that this matter had never been raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.565" offset="9638745">Or maybe he said that the courts had decided it, because the State has taken absolutely inconsistent positions, first saying that the trial courts decided it, and they did decide it, but by accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.940" offset="9692244">They thought that paragraph 41 referred to this claim when it referred to an earlier claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.843" offset="9711888">So first they tell the courts -- and you wouldn't know that unless you are pretty familiar because there were a lot of words written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.580" offset="9738846">They tell the courts: It's been decided, judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.699" offset="9751280">Don't worry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.318" offset="9753788">They decided it -- adequate State ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.251" offset="9761520">Then next they wake up to the fact that it wasn't decided, and then they announce: Oh, he waived it, despite the fact that there's a case called Swanson in Tennessee that says that you can raise a later claim if you have grounds for not knowing of it in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.130" offset="9832991">And he didn't know of it until 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.732" offset="9843440">So I see the State taking opposite positions and -- and what seems from the briefs inconsistent with the State law, and I'm confused.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.671" offset="11715166">It was the first time in the entire case that he mentioned anything at all about access to the prosecutor's files.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.290" offset="11733661">Then when he got an adverse judgment in the trial court, he never even made the argument in the Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.610" offset="11754977">He took a completely different theory about waiver, said that waiver was personal and should be -- should be judged on a subjective standard rather than objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.948" offset="11784234">Never mentioned to the Court of Criminal Appeals any argument whatsoever about access to the prosecutor's files.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.352" offset="11805863">It was on the basis of that argument that the Court of Criminal Appeals held that the Petitioner had failed to rebut the presumption of waiver as a matter of law as to all claims that had not been previously determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.659" offset="11847137">So that holding is an overarching holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.725" offset="11855391">It applies to every claim that was raised for the first time in the successive habeas position, and we think justified the district court -- it certainly was the basis of the district court's default and, as well, in 2001 was the basis of the Sixth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.985" offset="11908472">Now, regarding the 2007 decision, we concede that that decision could be read as presenting the question 1, where this Court relies on a finding of previous determination, but we don't think that's what the court did in 2007.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.114" offset="11976913">In 2007, the court specifically ruled that it was not revisiting the Brady claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.082" offset="11996871">That was a decision based on law of the case principles, and to the extent that it discussed previous determination, we don't think it in any way intended to modify its earlier holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.854" offset="12031875">In 2001, the Sixth Circuit clearly relied on the waiver bar, and that's very evident on pages 62 and 63a in the petition appendix, and that's the basis of the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.479" offset="12070431">So we don't even think that the -- that the situation in question 1 is even presented, although if -- to answer the question, in response to Justice Alito's question, I think it would be -- would be an absurd result to say that something that has been previously determined is defaulted, but that's not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.656" offset="12127065">The record shows it's not previously determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.456" offset="12134275">The Petitioner has never argued that it's previously determined, and no court until this point has ever even read the Court of Criminal Appeals' decision as making a previous determination finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.379" offset="12178056">Everyone has accepted the fact that that holding was a waiver holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.415" offset="12194147">So on that -- that's the basis of the default, and the reason that he was defaulted is that he failed to make that argument when he had -- when he the opportunity to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.871" offset="12223927">He could have made it, and he didn't make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.487" offset="12230405">He buried all his good arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.889" offset="12236048">Even on his waiver argument, he was making inconsistent arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.925" offset="12248168">On the one hand, he was saying the claim was novel, the claim of my post-conviction counsel didn't discuss it with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.662" offset="12275127">On the other hand, he says that I'm just now finding out about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.114" offset="12284949">Those are completely inconsistent theories, and the theory that he actually presented in the Court of Criminal Appeals bears no resemblance to the argument that he's making now or that he made in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.552" offset="12322670">But all of this aside, it really is -- is beside the point because at the end of the day, the district court very clearly addressed -- and specifically, not just in passing, but specifically at -- at various points in its -- in its opinion, the materiality of each and every item of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.348" offset="12389857">He went through in detail a discussion of the police teletypes, stating that -- that the jury already was aware that he was a drug user.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.210" offset="12573341">The district court certainly did look at them in categories and separated them, but I think if you look at the Sixth Circuit's opinion, certainly in 2007 where the court -- the court looked at it in more detail, I think that it is clear that the court cumulated the items and said that as a whole that the Brady materials don't undermine -- do not undermine confidence in the verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.966" offset="13016377">Not only is that -- what he said -- he specifically said he went into this individual's home with the purpose of getting fed, getting cleaned up, and getting out of town, and when the Todds ceased to cooperate with him, he had to control them physically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.858" offset="13063920">That's code I suppose for beating them to death because that's exactly what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.810" offset="13079698">He explained what he did and why he did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.095" offset="13088893">His actions are very calculated from -- from beginning to end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.730" offset="13103417">So whether he used drugs or not use drugs, the question is what was going on at the time of this murder?</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.718" offset="13123375">And by his own admission the reason that the Todds are -- are not with us today is because they ceased to cooperate; they became frightened; and he had to control them physically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.739" offset="13159424">I think that's the best evidence of his state of mind at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.508" offset="13170500">Those are words out of his own mouth, and I think that that certainly supports the finding of both the district court and the Sixth Circuit on materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.214" offset="13205400">I agree with the -- with Chief Justice's assessment: We do not think that the Brady claim is fairly included within the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.518" offset="13230582">The merits issue is not a predicate to the default question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.553" offset="13242702">I certainly understand Petitioner's dilemma in this case, but I think faced with that dilemma, he should have squarely presented that question among the questions presented and not dropped it in a footnote in argument 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.743" offset="13279483">We don't think it's fairly presented, but -- but in any event, it certainly justifies affirmance of the judgment or at a minimum dismissal of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.031" offset="13316577">And for all of these reasons, if there are no further questions, we ask that Court to affirm the judgment of the district court -- of the Sixth Circuit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3338.806" offset="13463698">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.758" offset="13475506">Justice Kennedy, he has been on death row; he is not in solitary confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.643" offset="13491075">Here's the dilemma I think about how the Court needs to dispose of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.964" offset="13512391">On the one hand, we have the State, which is unapologetic about having suppressed a whole bunch of evidence and about having misstated the procedural history to the State court and then to the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.505" offset="13558471">On the other hand, the Court's business is usually not to get into the weeds of things like fact-bound Brady claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.409" offset="13586160">And I think that the Court can accommodate both the concern of the signal that it would send in affirming the judgment in this case and also the -- the bad precedent it might set by getting into the jots and tittles of this witness statement and that witness statement, by resolving the case as follows: On page 22 and 24a of the petition appendix, the court of appeals says the claim was procedurally defaulted because it was previously determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.560" offset="13686784">That's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.560" offset="13690755">That is the argument that was passed upon by the court of appeals, and that should be reversed on procedural grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.730" offset="13715414">On the Brady claim, it seems to me that the court of appeals, when it did discuss the claim, made a couple of big mistakes the Court could identify and send the case back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.586" offset="13754807">The first is, when it talked about the merits, it said we don't think this evidence would have mattered because there was a lot of evidence at trial that he was a drug user.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.341" offset="13785840">But as has been discussed, I think in detail, the court of appeals, because its assessment was kind of passing here, misunderstood that when the experts said that, then the prosecutor turned around and completely discredited that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.333" offset="13833801">And so I think that colored the Sixth Circuit's assessment incorrectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.601" offset="13846862">The second is the Kyles point, and the third is the possibility that we're entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.339" offset="13869850">And so I think an opinion of this Court that simply dealt with the undefended procedural default ruling and then went to the merits and only made those three points and then left it to the lower courts to resolve the Brady claim ultimately would balance the concerns about the Court's institutional interests in not sending a signal of affirming this judgment in light of what the State has done here and not getting into the weeds of the claim.</text>
