            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="11.891" offset="154039">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The question presented in this case is whether the provision of enriched uranium under separative work unit or SWU contracts is covered by the Federal antidumping duty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.048" offset="202627">The resolution of that question turns on whether the performance of SWU contracts results in merchandise being sold in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.035" offset="234600">The Department of Commerce, which is the Federal agency entrusted by Congress with the administration of the antidumping duty law, concluded after an extensive investigation that SWU contracts do result in sales of enriched uranium.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.695" offset="285174">That determination was reasonable and should be sustained by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.397" offset="300011">Now, the fundamental bargain in a SWU contract is that the customer, the utility, provides a combination of feedstock or feed uranium plus cash, and receives in return a specified quantity and assay of enriched uranium, and by U-235 within the final product.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.096" offset="390813">Now, the customer has discretion to choose among varying combinations of feedstock and cash in order to complete the transaction for a particular quantity and assay of enriched uranium; but the enricher has its own discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.189" offset="451208">That is, having received the consideration paid by the utility, the enricher is free to make its own determination based on economic considerations as to the relative proportions of feedstocks and SWUs that should be used to make a given quantity of enriched uranium.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.466" offset="516305">So the overall -- the character of the overall transaction is comfortably characterized as a sale, because it involves the acquisition by the utility of a product, merchandise, that it didn't own at the outset of the transaction in exchange for consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.866" offset="621944">And the farmer takes his grain up and they operate on it, and then he drives away with the grain, milled.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.872" offset="657889">Now, it may make no difference to anybody whether the identical molecules are the same; and I think in such a case you'd say they are processing it; they are not buying and selling it.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.429" offset="708148">Well, indeed, as we've explained in our opening brief, at common law the distinction between a bailment and a sale in that type of circumstance depended upon whether the miller or the equivalent processor was under an obligation to return the very same thing in processed form.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.362" offset="1519929">The other thing we would say about the grain hypothetical is that when you hear about the farmer providing grain to the miller or the utilities providing feedstock to the enrichers, it may conjure up images of a tangible good that is in the physical possession of the farmer or the utility that is then physically transferred to the enricher.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.430" offset="1620135">In the case of the miller that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.397" offset="1628076">But the way that a utility provides feedstock to an enricher is not by taking physical possession of the feedstock and then by transporting it.</text>

            <text syncTime="728.507" offset="3020507">That is, although the contracts between the utility and the enricher deem the enriched uranium to have been produced with the customer's own feedstock, everybody acknowledges that that is not the fact in the real world.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.725" offset="3225307">And the Federal Circuit relied dominantly on the Florida Power case in which the same issue was presented, albeit under a different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.084" offset="3286747">But I -- reading that Florida Power, where the Federal Circuit adopted the Government's position, the Government's position then was that this very same transaction involved the rendition of services and not a sale of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.136" offset="3394999">Does the Government have a distinction between those two cases, or are you now saying in hindsight you realized that the position that you took before the Federal Circuit in the early case was wrong?</text>

            <text syncTime="840.113" offset="3466888">I don't think we have disavowed the position we took in the Florida Power &amp; Light case.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.501" offset="3488413">Now, in all candor, I would have to say the question of the Contract Disputes -- Disputes Act's applicability to SWU contracts is of a lot less interest to the Federal Government now than it was then, because the reason that arose in a case involving the Federal Government was that at that time USEC was a Government instrumentality and we were representing USEC in its governmental incarnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.217" offset="3587260">Now that USEC has been privatized, the Federal Circuit is unlikely to confront the question whether the Contract Disputes Act applies to this sort of arrangements, because these are not -- this is not a Federal entity, in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.709" offset="3641281">The reason that we think the two cases are reconcilable is that the Contract Disputes Act, as its name implies, is a statute that governs the resolution of disputes between contracting parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.450" offset="3692272">And in that situation, it's much more appropriate to look to the form of the parties' arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.021" offset="3714529">And the court -- the Federal Circuit in Florida Power and Light placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that the contract was styled as one for enrichment services.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.460" offset="3752249">And that is an appropriate consideration to take into account when you are resolving disputes between the contracting parties, but when the whole purpose of the antidumping statute is to prevent contracting parties from entering into arrangements that are mutually beneficial to themselves, but that would and unfairly disadvantage domestic competitors, it was appropriate for Commerce to look behind the form of the contract and to look at physical and economic reality.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.095" offset="4278774">It is possible to look at this very narrow set of circumstances where a customer is providing raw materials of the kind that the producer uses to make a good, and to say in that circumstance we could look at it as the customer providing two kinds of consideration for the good it's receiving; or we could look at it, as the Respondents do and as the Federal Circuit did, as saying, the other way to look at it is this is essentially the customer receiving a service on its own goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.816" offset="4405729">Now it seems to me to begin with, the question that is before the Court properly is whether Commerce, which is undoubtedly the agency charged with enforcing this statute, has adopted a reasonable view when it's taken one of those two positions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.444" offset="4480230">Maybe at some point -- maybe it's not a relevant question -- but I will assume for the sake of argument Commerce does have the power to classify it either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.633" offset="4517010">What is bothering me, and maybe that's not in this case, is that as the -- as your brother lawyer just said, this statute has been around for 90 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.089" offset="4550760">There has been trillions of dollars worth of foreign commerce during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.393" offset="4568001">Yet I don't find cited here any instance in which Commerce ever before said that when you have title to a good, and you send it abroad, for even a big change in it, and then it comes back, that that is a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.236" offset="4635397">Now, I might -- I don't know all the Commerce cases; maybe they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.222" offset="4651384">But what I found here is like a blank on that side, and on the other side the tolling cases, Florida Power &amp; Light, the pizza case, to the point where I thought, if I was a lawyer advising a client, and that client said if I keep title to the good, am I home free, I would have to say, yes, you are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.657" offset="4869036">--Where we discuss Commerce's tolling precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.059" offset="4878649">And then it went and it essentially decided that what it had done in that precedent, it wanted to reexamine that, because it thought in the end what was happening in all of those cases is there was a resale of the merchandise; and it thought it would be a better practice to focus on that sale of the merchandise for purposes of applying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.557" offset="4956703">When it did that, however, it found it had created a loophole in the case where there wasn't a further sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.543" offset="4980632">So it has gone back to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.226" offset="4987319">So at least in terms of the precedent, Commerce has been on different sides of that, but they have been wrestling with exactly the problem that I outlined at the beginning, which is dealing with a question that essentially has no ready answer to it and trying to pick among the plausible answers that were available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.922" offset="5054088">Secondly, just about the specific situation here, I don't believe that there is any chance that the utilities and the enricher in this case could claim unfair surprise or unjust reliance; because they say in their own briefs, they did not set their transactions up in this way in order to try to comply with prior decisions of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.787" offset="5145621">They say -- they make a point in their brief in saying we have perfectly innocent intentions here, that they set their transactions up purely for historical and commercial reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.143" offset="5186999">So -- now, the other question that Justice Breyer raises is about the cases, and Justice Ginsburg I think mentioned earlier the Florida Power &amp; Light decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.450" offset="5232243">And again, Florida Power &amp; Light is a case in which there is no agency that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.870" offset="5261918">So at that point there is no question of Chevron deference, no question of whether this is a reasonable position; all that the Court had to decide was, given the possible choices, which did it think was the better choice under those circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.149" offset="5323045">And particularly I think it's important in that case, is the Federal Circuit said, this is a case that doesn't fall readily into either of the two categories.</text>

            <text syncTime="1472.473" offset="5996377">And the question would be in this case, could Commerce reasonably think that the manufacturer had sufficient control over the new good to be deemed the owner of that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.883" offset="6970013">As you suggested, Justice Breyer -- you referred to -- the Department of Commerce has treated processors who are called "tollers", in the language that Commerce uses, as performing a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.160" offset="7031035">And the transaction for the sale of that service has not been treated as a cognizable sale under the antidumping law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.736" offset="7093415">Not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.252" offset="7095400">Sometimes that is the case, Your Honor, but not always.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.704" offset="7105223">For example, in the Taiwan Semiconductors case, which Mr. Stewart referred to and which is cited in our brief, what the U.S. company provided was simply a design to for a chip.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.096" offset="7146809">The Taiwanese company, which was the processor in the case according to the Department of Commerce, manufactured the chip, provided the silica, used the design of the U.S. company, but no raw materials at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.137" offset="7203025">The Department of Commerce, in its explanation as to why it treated the sale for purposes of the antidumping law as the eventual sale by the U.S. company and did not and could not treat the sale by the processor as a cognizable sale, explained that the statute itself requires Commerce to compare the U.S. price, which is called the export price, the price at which a good is sold or imported into the United States, with the price at which the product is sold in the company's home market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.577" offset="7344713">And because a processor does not and cannot either provide all the essential components of the product, because it's only providing the processing service and not the raw materials, and because it does not and cannot set the price at which the product is sold in the United States, it is therefore not the appropriate sale to look at that in terms of the antidumping statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.589" offset="7512837">And in the latter case, you would say that's a sale, and in the former case you would say it's not a sale?</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.063" offset="7558708">In fact, in one of the cases that we cite regarding flanges which were, according to the Department of Commerce, fungible, they concluded that the processing service there was not the cognizable sale, the downstream sale of that product was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.823" offset="7621716">But more importantly it doesn't change the substance of the deal between the two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.291" offset="7639583">What the utilities come to the table with is cash, and they provide the feed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.933" offset="7682215">And when the feed is put into the gaseous diffusion chamber, which is the very large installation that the enricher uses to concentrate the two different molecular isotopes, it takes a month for the gas to work its way through this plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.943" offset="7750238">The enricher cannot feasibly segregate different lots of feed, just like you can't with a grain elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.381" offset="7783988">The analogy would be, with respect to a grain elevator, you would have to run in one farmer's bag of feed, run it all the way through the elevator and through the mill, and wait until the product comes out at the end, and then run another farmer's bag of feed through.</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.786" offset="10685565">And it instructs the Department to look at the price at which the product is sold in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3382.678" offset="13637193">I would like to touch briefly, if I can, on the purpose of the statute, because the government relies very strongly on this notion that somehow the processors' sales have to cognizable in order to further the antidumping statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.670" offset="13693095">This law is not a boundless license to protect domestic industry from any competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.241" offset="13715456">There are other statutes that are are written much more broadly in the trade laws; for example, the countervailing duties law, the safeguards law which allows the Department of Commerce to impose quotas or tariffs on the import -- not the sale but the import of any goods, statutes regarding the protection of intellect0ual property rights, all of which are cited in the -- in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.088" offset="13802809">So the notion that somehow to protect the integrity of the statute you need to rewrite it to allow them to address processing sales exclusively is really not -- not well-founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.847" offset="13857876">Finally, with respect to the loophole question that the government has relied on, I think it's important to focus on what is specifically at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.436" offset="13888178">The government initially argued that it was critical to address this case and these particular transactions because of concerns about agreements with the Russians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.828" offset="13933735">That has been addressed as to U.S. concedes in its reply brief by -- legislation that has been implemented by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.767" offset="13969471">The government has consistently in court and in its decisions -- not just in the Contract Disputes Act that you referenced Justice Ginsburg, but in other cases regarding the UCC which relates to the sale of goods, the government has said: These very kinds of contracts for the processing of uranium are contracts for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.430" offset="14056197">They are not covered by statutes that reach the sale of goods or the disposal of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.963" offset="14146267">One of the things Ms. Halligan said, and I think it's really a central theme of their brief, is that utilities come to the enricher for services and not for goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.967" offset="14178346">And to understand what it is that utilities acquire, I think it may be helpful to ask: Under what circumstances would the utility have a valid breach-ofcontract right?</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.238" offset="14211365">And it is very clear that the enricher's obligation under the contract is to deliver a specified quantity and assay of enriched uranium at a specified time and place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.594" offset="14248772">And if the enricher complies with that obligation, it doesn't matter that the enricher decided to -- what they call in the industry -- SWU's to produce the final product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.802" offset="14297673">And the utility in that circumstance couldn't file a breach-of-contract claim by saying: I paid for more SWU's than I actually received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.008" offset="14326512">Because what the utility had contracted for was a given product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.194" offset="14339260">The second thing -- and I think the corollary to that is -- it's potentially misleading to say that every contract is either one for merchandise or one for services, especially when you are contracting to acquire ownership of a commodity that doesn't exist at the time the contract is formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.738" offset="14409373">The only way you are going to get to your ultimate objective is for somebody to create it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.123" offset="14426927">And that can generally be described as a service, but it still results in the sale of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.427" offset="14444168">With respect to the used-car analogy, I understood Ms. Halligan to acknowledge that -- that that would be a sale even though the consideration paid by the customer is partly in cash and partly in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.902" offset="14490039">And if the customer and the car dealership characterize their contract as one for car-refurbishment services and said that the new car the customer receives shall be deemed to be the used car that it traded in in refurbished form, nobody would contend that that deeming quality should be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.030" offset="14562555">Now here the -- the falseness of the proposition that it's the same feedstock is less apparent, but it's equally the case that the utility doesn't receive back its original feedstock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.736" offset="14605396">And finally the perspective of tolling regulation in cases, Commerce has essentially said three things: First, we were dealing with a separate question; that is, who is the producer, which sale is relevant, and not whether the goods are covered at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.210" offset="14651267">Second, they said in those situations the tollee was exercising much more control over the ultimate process than is the case here where the utilities don't manufacture anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.703" offset="14701213">They simply pay for one of the inputs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.703" offset="14709258">And, finally, Commerce said that if at some level of abstraction there is a tension or contradiction between what we said previously and what we decide today, then what we decide today controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.094" offset="14750845">And Commerce is entitled to make that determination.</text>
