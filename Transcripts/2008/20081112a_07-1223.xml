            <text syncTime="6.570" offset="132723">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The problem at the heart of this case is construing subsections (d) and (e) of 28 U.S.C. 2254 together in a way that makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.163" offset="191133">The last time that this Court construed those two provisions together was in Michael Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.650" offset="213076">Michael Williams presented a different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.033" offset="222584">But we believe that looking at how Michael Williams would play out with a small change in the facts will help frame the issue that's before the court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.773" offset="257588">Now, as the Court recalls, in Michael Williams the Virginia Supreme Court denied Williams the investigative assistance he needed in order to help develop a claim based on his suspicions of jury misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.397" offset="303982">He, therefore, didn't make the claim in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.516" offset="316520">On -- in Federal court he got investigative assistance; and, in speaking with the investigator, two of the jurors referred to the foreperson, Bonnie Stinette, as Bonnie Minehart.</text>

            <text syncTime="66.208" offset="371273">We took this case to decide a question, and one of the factual predicates of the question is that the State court refused to consider certain evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.016" offset="422473">And I'm puzzled about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.385" offset="431982">What was the evidence that the State court -- do you say that the State court refused to consider evidence that was proffered to it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard P. Bress</label>
            <text syncTime="114.489" offset="564370">Specifically, Your Honor, the State provided 120 days to develop the State habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.827" offset="585791">The Petitioners during that time developed 14 different claims, including the claim that's at issue here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.783" offset="617556">In the course of that they interviewed, I think, 11 different witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.485" offset="636364">For the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim they got affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.722" offset="657366">They also interviewed all 12 jurors for five different claims of juror misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.109" offset="678891">They interviewed five different witnesses for Brady claims, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.410" offset="692057">They ran out of time, Your Honor, and they asked the court for more time on repeated occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.714" offset="709298">They asked the court to investigate--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="153.098" offset="718806">But that really does not present the question that you asked the Court to decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.135" offset="738973">--Well, Your Honor, if you read it that way, it would not, but I don't read the question presented that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.206" offset="763319">I read the question presented to present the question of when the district court properly hears evidence after a finding of diligence by the prisoner and holds that the State court didn't provide a full and fair opportunity to that prisoner to develop the facts in State court, that where the evidence is important the -- the district court may consider that evidence, rather than giving deference to the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.029" offset="898529">And giving deference to the State court is not even on the table any longer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.981" offset="914411">It was -- what the Fourth Circuit did, the Fourth Circuit took the new evidence into account and deferred to the State court nonetheless.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.979" offset="1010333">The -- as the Virginia Commonwealth attorneys point out in their amicus brief, there is a rule in the Virginia State court that any facts not set out in the habeas petition at the State level can't be brought in later.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.439" offset="1064249">He wasn't able to bring the facts in afterwards.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.128" offset="1098940">No, they weren't, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.928" offset="1106150">There were three categories of new facts or new evidence that came in on Federal habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.366" offset="1127884">And if I may, the first -- the first of them had to do with facts that undermined the State's claim of aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.805" offset="1161634">The State relied on only one aggravating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.173" offset="1171143">That was future dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.073" offset="1178770">And in the course of that, in developing it, their number one emphasis was on one adjudicated -- unadjudicated bad act, and this was a story told by Billy Jo Swartz about an alleged horrific assault on her and of Tracy Nicholson, who was a girlfriend of the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.837" offset="1257765">What the jury didn't know at the time was that both Tracy and her mother, who were there, said that the incident did not occur, that there was no assault there, and Billy Jo Swartz was a liar.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.895" offset="1302068">Now, on State habeas, Joanne did submit an affidavit and, in that affidavit, said that Billy Jo Swartz had lied.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.565" offset="1332684">That created a dispute of fact at the State level, but unfortunately rather than hear the witnesses to determine the credibility and -- the Virginia Supreme Court instead decided against Petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.776" offset="1401543">There was a dispute on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.212" offset="1407289">There was evidence on both sides.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.933" offset="1542186">They said, on the one hand, they did, and yet, on the other hand, when they were looking, for example, at Joanne Nicholson's testimony, they said she could have been effectively impeached by other statements that she had made, that in their household, she had never seen Bell be physically abusive to her daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.745" offset="1613448">Now, Joanne Nicholson and Tracy Nicholson have said throughout that he was never physically abusive to Tracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.934" offset="1646153">The supposed impeachment would have come from police court records that have never been introduced in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.320" offset="1667678">So the Virginia Supreme Court, without a hearing, just said, on the one hand, we accept these facts as true and, on the other hand, even though Joanne Nicholson would testify that this event never occurred that way, she would have been impeached so the jury wouldn't have believed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.526" offset="1904556">You know, when your firm with all of its expertise and resources comes into the case at the Federal habeas level, will it not always be the case that you will be able to find some additional mitigation evidence and then, under your theory, that will be a new claim and it well get de novo review?</text>

            <text syncTime="476.010" offset="2010509">The Sixth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit have adopted that rule for Brady claims, and we haven't seen the flood that supposedly is going to come through the gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.282" offset="2043528">Secondly, on a more theoretical level, for someone to be able to introduce this new evidence on Federal habeas, they have to first be able to demonstrate that they were diligent in attempting to formulate it in the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.590" offset="2092847">Second, they've got to be able to demonstrate that it's important and importantly changes the overall factual mix.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.967" offset="6546307">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The claim in Bell's case is the textbook example of a claim that the effective death penalty intended for 2254(d) to apply to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.409" offset="6604089">In the Virginia Supreme Court, Bell presented his claim with his allegations of what he says counsel didn't present and didn't find at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.749" offset="6637422">And the Virginia Supreme Court assumed the truth of all of those allegations and did not contest any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.653" offset="6661036">There were never any facts in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.819" offset="6669709">The State never contested any facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.455" offset="6680263">The State court assumed them all true, and then applied -- faithfully applied this Court's established precedent under Strickland and Wiggins, in particular, and weighed that evidence that he had claimed had not been found by his counsel against the aggravating evidence in this case of a drug dealer who killed premeditatedly a police officer in a small town and upon weighing that found as a -- as a matter -- as a de novo matter on the merits that he could not show prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.176" offset="6811188">Because there was no reasonable probability that a jury would have found a life sentence giving -- assuming the truth of everything he alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.348" offset="6839818">Now, when he went to Federal court, the Fourth Circuit faithfully applied 2254(d) to that after addressing all of the same evidence and also agreeing that there was no prejudice, and then said that the State court decision was not unreasonable under 2254(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.077" offset="6910767">Now, Bell comes to this Court and says for the first time that I have a new claim, and that was not made below, and this is not a new claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.534" offset="6956534">Everything that he presented in Federal court was presented to the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.153" offset="6979103">There is absolutely no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.121" offset="6986940">In fact, to the effect that there was some difference in the district court and the State alleged -- we pleaded default because he presented a few new affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.663" offset="7033125">The district court resolved that and said: I'm not even going to look at those because they aren't critical to my decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.019" offset="7062486">I am only going to look at -- and he described in particular the exact same record that the Virginia Supreme Court had found.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.310" offset="7223714">It was only this one issue that the district court found -- believed that he needed to have a hearing on, we believe erroneously.</text>

            <text syncTime="1874.539" offset="7604579">Could he then come into the Federal court and say: My claim here is not only ineffective assistance, but ineffective assistance with the overlay of the refusal of the State courts to give me an adequate opportunity to develop my -- my ineffective assistance claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.600" offset="7680857">And if he made a colorable showing on those two issues, would he then have an opportunity for a Federal evidentiary issue, and would the findings that eventuated from that be subject to -- in effect, to -- to being short-circuited by deference to the State court findings?</text>

            <text syncTime="1911.645" offset="7753059">--I think my answer to that has to be that it depends because the statute before the effective Death Penalty Act in 1996 had clearly had what we would call the Chandler v. Dane factors in which would you look at the adequacy of a State court process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.339" offset="7823799">Those were removed after 1996, so the statute does not provide authority for a Federal court to go in and determine was the process adequate if the decision, itself, was reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.866" offset="8081889">In the Effective Death Penalty Act Congress left that alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.649" offset="8281046">The Brady standard, however, does not require the probability of a different verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.535" offset="8300586">Brady uses the term</text>

            <text syncTime="2056.622" offset="8332978">So that in fact with respect to Brady claims subsection (e) is imposing a higher requirement than Brady did and a higher requirement than would have been applied before Brady.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.308" offset="12695636">In McNeal and Claudy, this Court did hold that, in certain instances, a State habeas court must hold a hearing if there are facts in dispute and they are not willing to assume them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.666" offset="12737118">I agree that a State doesn't have to have a proceeding at all, but if it has one, it has to be fair.</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.704" offset="12773272">The State did deny us additional time, expert assistance discovery, and a hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.341" offset="12799812">The Federal court specifically found that we were diligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.310" offset="12815694">That's at 84a.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.595" offset="12820814">And in Michael Williams, this court said that the finding of diligence also constituted a finding of cause for purposes of cause and prejudice, which makes sense because you've got a prisoner who has done the most they can and yet hasn't been able to fully develop the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.839" offset="12885807">There was no external impediment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.124" offset="12894898">As you'll recall, in Michael Williams, the information was there; it was just very hard to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.527" offset="12912556">Finally, we presented very substantial new evidence on the Federal level here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.829" offset="12933768">It's simply not true that there is no new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.014" offset="12942545">The new evidence included evidence undermining the sole aggravating factor, both the live testimony of Joanne Nicholson, which allowed the court actually to determine whether she would have been a credible person to undermine the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.989" offset="12990401">The State had held on the papers she wasn't credible, which the State can't do on the papers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.595" offset="13020808">He was beaten with electrical cords, with planks, with a belt, leaving the scars on his body that he bears today.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.299" offset="13559662">Your Honor, I think she said that what you would have to look for, I think, is whether "wholly new matter" means "new evidence".</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.352" offset="13583903">If she says it's new evidence, such as new DNA evidence, we agree completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.672" offset="13601144">That's not what she said previously in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.691" offset="13609190">Previously, she had said that new evidence in that sense, like DNA evidence, can't make that claim a new claim and, therefore, you're foreclosed under 2254(d), so long as the State court's opinion is intrinsically reasonable based on its inadequate record.</text>
