            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Thomas has our opinion this morning in case 07-581, 14 Penn Plaza versus Pyett.</text>

            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="8.146" offset="137968">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.639" offset="167957">Respondents are members of the Service Employees International Union who worked for petitioner Temco Service Industries as night lobby watchmen and in similar capacities in a building owned and operated by petitioner 14 Penn Plaza.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.453" offset="247265">14 Penn Plaza is a member of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, a multiemployer bargaining association for the New York City Real Estate Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.852" offset="300868">The Union and the Board entered into a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.468" offset="319258">I'll refer to that as a CBA that requires union members to submit all claims of employment discrimination to binding arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.471" offset="363353">14 Penn Plaza, with the Union's consent engaged a contractor affiliated with Temco to provide licensed security guards for the building causing Temco to reassign respondents to jobs as porters and cleaners.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.484" offset="431376">Contending at least reassignments violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, ADEA, respondents through the Union requested arbitration under the CBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.630" offset="491980">After the initial hearing, however, the Union withdrew the age discrimination claims on the grounds that its consent to the new security contract precluded it from objecting to respondent's reassignments as discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.111" offset="557913">Respondents then filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which issued them a right to sue notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.682" offset="592185">In the ensuing lawsuit, petitioners filed a motion to compel the arbitration of respondents' age discrimination claims in accordance with the CBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.634" offset="635967">The District Court denied the motion and the Second Circuit affirmed holding that this Court's decision in Alexander-Gardner-Denver Company forbids enforcement of collective bargaining provisions that require arbitration of ADEA claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.251" offset="706393">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.137" offset="730008">A provision in a collective bargaining agreement that clearly and unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate ADEA claims is enforceable as a matter of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.524" offset="783506">The Union and the Board collectively bargained in good faith and agreed that employment-related discrimination claims including ADEA claims would be resolved in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.223" offset="834288">This freely negotiated contractual term easily qualifies as a condition of employment subject to mandatory bargaining under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.631" offset="887996">Thus the CBA's arbitration provision must be honored unless the ADEA itself requires this arbitration, this particular class of grievances from the -- whether the ADEA itself removes -- I'm sorry, the -- this particular class of grievances from the NLRA's broad sweep.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.657" offset="972006">It does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.646" offset="980052">This Court squarely held in Gilmer versus Interstate/Johnson Lane Corporation that the ADEA does not preclude arbitration of federal age discrimination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.169" offset="1026132">The CBA's arbitration provision is also fully enforceable under the Gardner-Denver line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.893" offset="1052985">The facts underlying Gardner-Denver and its progeny revealed the narrow scope of the legal rule they engendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.178" offset="1082138">As the Court explained in Gilmore, these cases “did not involve the issue of the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statutory claims,” but “the quite different issue whether the arbitration of contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statutory claims.”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.110" offset="1161864">Gardner-Denver does not control the outcome whereas here, the CBA's arbitration provision expressly covers both statutory and contractual discrimination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.785" offset="1212541">Even though the Gardner-Denver line of cases included broad dicta highly critical of using arbitration to vindicate statutory antidiscrimination rights, that skepticism rested on a misconceived view of arbitration that this Court has since abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.034" offset="1289550">Finally, this Court is not positioned to resolve the first -- in the first instance respondent's claims that the CBA allows a Union to prevent them from effectively vindicating their federal statutory rights in the arbitral form.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.998" offset="1357364">This question would require resolution of contested factual allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.419" offset="1379098">It was not fully briefed here or below, and it is not fairly encompassed within the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.147" offset="1406056">We therefore reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.952" offset="1437194">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.696" offset="1452241">Justice Souter also has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer have joined.</text>
