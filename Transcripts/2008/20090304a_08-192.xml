            <text syncTime="186.283" offset="850589">That would be the sort of person that comes within 18 U.S.C. as an aider or abettor of drug distribution and also would come within 843(b) as a facilitator of drug distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.719" offset="1164267">That person was able to avoid detection because they never came into physical contact with drugs and they didn't come into physical contact with the persons who were engaging in the transaction on the street.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.398" offset="1399056">Is it because the terms still cover it, that's -- the breadth has expanded, or because this is something new technologically that the statute shouldn't be construed that broadly?</text>

            <text syncTime="362.599" offset="1555790">You know, before there were automobiles, you had to have someone with a lantern walk in front of your carriage, and they don't change the law and it still turns out to be the law when you're driving your car, and it doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.081" offset="1597795">But, I mean, is there a case of ours that says what to do in that case, in such a situation of statutory construction?</text>

            <text syncTime="382.968" offset="1637292">But our argument doesn't depend on that logic, because even in 1970, certainly land lines were well in use, and in fact the indications are that that's what Congress was principally concerned with in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.478" offset="1683372">And even -- and at that time we would make the argument, just as now, a person who used the telephone in buying drugs for personal use wouldn't come within the ambit of the provision because the text of the provision goes to someone who uses a phone in committing, in facilitating, or in causing the commission of a drug felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.114" offset="1749828">And so if you're not someone who's facilitating the commission of a drug felony in the first place, then you can't be charged as using a phone in facilitating a drug felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.611" offset="1783892">And the reason that a buyer for personal use, whether we're talking about 1970 or now, wouldn't be considered a person who is using a phone in facilitating a drug felony is because of the buyer-seller rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.152" offset="1830076">Buyers aren't aiders and abettors of the felony distribution, and by the same token they shouldn't be considered facilitators of felony distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.483" offset="1963301">First, their definitional equivalence.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.496" offset="1971451">Black's Law Dictionary defines "facilitating" as</text>
            <text syncTime="469.604" offset="1983885">"an act of aiding or helping or making easier. "</text>
            <text syncTime="471.994" offset="1993394">and it in turn defines "aiding and abetting" as</text>
            <text syncTime="475.180" offset="2006141">"to facilitate the commission of the crime. "</text>
            <text syncTime="476.759" offset="2012411">So they mean the very same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.491" offset="2019412">And I don't think there's anything talismanic about the particular formulation "aiding and abetting", and in fact the Court established that in its opinion in Gebardi.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.677" offset="2048146">That statute dealt with the Mann Act, which barred transporting a woman for purposes of engaging in immoral acts or aiding or assisting in that transportation or causing the transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.948" offset="4593204">It -- it is the statutory history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.167" offset="4602086">And I'm speaking now in terms of the enacted statutory text; not legislative history, but the history of the enacted statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.258" offset="4626432">And what that bears on is not the word "facilitating", which is what the buyer-seller rule particularly pertains to, but the word "felony", which is another word in the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.971" offset="4665302">And so Congress could have barred the use of a phone in connection with any drug offense, including a drug misdemeanor, but Congress pointedly didn't do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1151.327" offset="4710755">And because it chose to limit the offense to the use of a phone in connection with a drug felony, the effect is to exclude from the purview of the statute use of a phone in connection with a drug misdemeanor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.772" offset="4792466">Before the Controlled Substances Act, the communication facility provision barred the use of a phone in connection with any drug offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.863" offset="4816917">And in 1970 in the Controlled Substances Act, Congress narrowed its reach to encompass only use of a phone in connection with a drug felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.343" offset="4846801">So it excluded use of a phone in connection with a drug misdemeanor, and that's significant in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.701" offset="4868221">One is, even without reference to the statutory context of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, it's significant because Congress excluded use of a phone in connection with a drug misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.852" offset="4908868">Petitioner used a phone in connection with his misdemeanor, simple possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.083" offset="4925795">But under the government's argument, the very same conduct by the very same person would be brought back into the fold of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.536" offset="4951604">Even though Congress excluded it, it would be brought back into the fold of the statute by recasting it as facilitating the dealer's felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.609" offset="4979816">And the mode of analysis the Court used in Gebardi and the mode of analysis that underlies the buyer-seller rule to begin with would -- would lead us not to infer that Congress would have intended that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.557" offset="5019627">But in terms of the history and the statutory context which you were alluding to, Justice Ginsburg, it is significant for that reason, as well, because the context in which Congress narrowed the reach of section 843(b) so that it only encompasses facilitation of a felony and not facilitation of a misdemeanor is one in which Congress, in the 1970 Act, sought to extend leniency and afford a chance at rehabilitation to drug users.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.722" offset="5116280">And that's manifested not in legislative history but in the statutory text itself, because Congress penalized simple possession for personal use as a misdemeanor; whereas, the receipt of drugs previously was a felony, regardless of the purpose of the possession, whether it was for use or for distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.947" offset="5185243">But Congress did more than that, because in immediately adjacent provisions to the one in which it narrowed simple possession to a misdemeanor, it also enacted a provision which is now found in 18 U.S.C. 3607, which allowed a simple possessor who is a first-time offender to avoid any conviction at all if they successfully complete a period of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.424" offset="5267163">And Congress went further still because it also enacted, in another adjacent provision, further relief for a first-time simple possessor who is under the age of 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.903" offset="5304989">With respect to that person, it allowed the person to obtain a complete expungement of the criminal records associated with the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2030.893" offset="8229031">But part of the reason we can infer is that the 1970 statute created a whole host of misdemeanors, of misdemeanor regulatory offenses under the Controlled Substances Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.996" offset="8273439">So one good example is section 829, which prohibits distributing a controlled substance without a prescription, and that's an offense -- that's a misdemeanor, and that could easily be caused or facilitated over the phone, if somebody calls a pharmacist.</text>

            <text syncTime="3437.062" offset="13853717">I think you said that the -- the presence of the use of the telephone was not just a jurisdictional hook, because back in 1970 the Federal Government really wasn't in the criminal law business the way it has become in the last 30 or 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.262" offset="13914425">At that time, there was a lot of concern -- the Travel Act and other statutes -- about exactly what the Federal justification for -- justification for Federal participation existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.562" offset="14031663">And the telephone law presupposes that one of those underlying acts is already going on.</text>
