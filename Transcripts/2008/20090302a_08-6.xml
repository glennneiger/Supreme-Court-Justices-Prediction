            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-6, District Attorney's Office for the Third Judicial District v. Osborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.620" offset="137927">Mr. Rosenstein.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth M. Rosenstein</label>
            <text syncTime="8.899" offset="143047">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State of Alaska fully recognizes the importance of DNA evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.930" offset="171154">The State provides criminal defendants with pretrial access to that evidence, and it has postconviction procedures that give prisoners a fair opportunity to retest that evidence should new technology become available.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.222" offset="216398">So this case really isn't about the importance or power of DNA evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.893" offset="239073">Rather it's about three things: First, it's about the proper procedural device for asserting in Federal court a right to postconviction testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.982" offset="275435">Section 1983 is not the correct device because Mr. Osborne's claim clearly sounds in Federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.945" offset="307200">The evidence he seeks has a singular relevance to support a direct attack on the validity of his confinement.</text>

            <text syncTime="57.069" offset="335726">Well, he's -- he's not -- at this point all he's doing is seeking evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.349" offset="356833">We don't know -- he doesn't know, presumably -- exactly what that evidence is going to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.160" offset="380134">The evidence may prove to be exonerating and it may not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.170" offset="400196">Until one knows the tendency of the evidence, one can't say that we have a Preiser problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.873" offset="426945">So if -- if we don't have that kind of a problem, then I don't see -- I guess I don't follow your argument that this necessarily sounds in habeas.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.009" offset="467487">Well, Your Honor, the -- Mr. Osborne's case is comparable to Balisok v. Edwards, where the Petitioner was seeking damages for -- as a result of a biased hearing in prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.656" offset="542093">And if he was seeking damages in this 1983 action for false imprisonment or -- or imprisonment under an invalid conviction, I would understand your argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.091" offset="583784">But what he is saying in effect is: I want process to know what this evidence has to say; and that is not seeking damages, and it's not seeking release.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.008" offset="631536">It's not seeking damages, but the proof -- the difference between this case -- the only difference between this case and Balisok is that in this case the proof is going to be happening in a laboratory; whereas, in Balisok the--</text>

            <text syncTime="145.252" offset="688483">The difference -- the difference is that if he succeeds in this case in getting access to the evidence, that doesn't get him outside or -- or even in position to go outside the prison door.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.558" offset="741669">All it does is get him some evidence to test.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.136" offset="752013">And what he does with that later, if he finds it favorable, presumably is necessarily going to be in habeas.</text>
