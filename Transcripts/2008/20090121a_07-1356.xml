            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="7.137" offset="133998">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court has always held that a defendant's voluntary statements obtained in violation of constitutional standards may be used for impeachment purposes when the defendant testifies at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.031" offset="201498">The Court has excluded statements for all purposes only when they are involuntary or have been compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.619" offset="231905">The question in this case is whether voluntary statements obtained in violation of the rule of Massiah v. United States should be treated differently than all other voluntary statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.879" offset="284985">The answer is no for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.481" offset="299301">First, permitting the impeachment use of voluntary statements obtained in violation of constitutional standards is necessary to prevent perjury by criminal defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.639" offset="347993">Second, in terms of the effect at trial, there's no basis for distinguishing a voluntary statement obtained in violation of the Massiah rule from Fourth Amendment violations, Miranda violations, or violations of the rule of Michigan v. Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.916" offset="417061">In all of those situations the resulting evidence may limit defense counsel's options at trial, but there's no basis in that respect for distinguishing a Massiah violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.391" offset="463036">It has no different effect than those others.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.093" offset="473799">Also, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not include a right to commit perjury or to have the assistance of counsel in presenting false testimony.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="100.949" offset="509221">When does -- when does the Sixth Amendment violation occur?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_mcallister" startTime="104.400" stopTime="132.735">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="104.400" offset="523013">That question, Your Honor, as you realize, is debated a bit in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.471" offset="543284">It's -- Kansas, for purposes of deciding this case, is willing to accept the position of the United States and the Respondent that it occurs when the statement is admitted at trial, although the cases have not necessarily definitively resolved that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.962" offset="597305">We, frankly, think it's unnecessary to answer the question because it's a minimal point in terms of potential deterrent -- deterrents that operate in this setting--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="132.735" stopTime="146.977">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="132.735" offset="636385">Do you -- do we have any other situation in which, for purposes of impeaching testimony, a constitutional violation is allowed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_mcallister" startTime="146.977" stopTime="182.334">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="146.977" offset="693332">--Well, that's the -- that's one of the intricacies of -- of this particular question, although arguably in the -- in the Fifth Amendment context certainly, the Miranda warnings are given.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.939" offset="757175">The police don't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.956" offset="761250">And -- and if that is the completion of the violation, it's -- it's analogous in many ways, if one looks back at the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.378" offset="790925">The Court has suggested that the actual violation is the use of the statement at trial against the defendant, not simply obtaining it without the necessary warnings being given.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.484" offset="827392">So we would argue that is, in fact--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="182.334" stopTime="183.270">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="182.334" offset="834706">It's parallel to the Fifth.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_mcallister" startTime="183.269" stopTime="234.202">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="183.269" offset="838468">--It's parallel to the Fifth in this respect, and certainly, distinct from the Fourth in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.106" offset="861874">But we don't think it matters at the end of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.806" offset="868665">If -- if one were to treat it like the Fourth Amendment, so that the violation is complete when the police send in an informant and he works hard to elicit statements in violation of the Messiah rule, if it's complete at that time, then all of the analysis from the Fourth Amendment cases is equally applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.551" offset="935643">If the violation does not incur -- occur until it's presented at trial, then it's analogous more to the Fifth Amendment and also to the Michigan v. Jackson and Michigan v. Harvey cases, which were a Sixth Amendment right to counsel violation, in which case the Court says it was wrong for the police to initiate interrogation after he had invoked his rights, but will let the statement be admitted for impeachment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.416" offset="1027072">So it's exactly analogous to what the Court did in Harvey itself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="234.202" stopTime="280.866">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="234.202" offset="1042223">It would make no difference, I take it, General McAllister, if this had been a police officer who was pretending to be a cellmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.343" offset="1090811">In this case it was a snitch, but it could be the police officer doing inside the cell what he couldn't do outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.834" offset="1136786">That is, the police officer outside who wants to interrogate must inform the arrestee of his Miranda rights, but inside the cell, the police could pretend to be a jailbird and they can -- can get the information that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.914" offset="1225080">Is that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_mcallister" startTime="280.866" stopTime="337.768">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="280.866" offset="1228842">Well, Justice Ginsburg, I believe that is correct if -- if it's for example, an undercover officer, someone has gone in -- and in fact, there are cases such as Weatherford v. Bursey that involved an undercover agent who was present for meetings with the defendant and his counsel, and the Court indicated that the presence alone would not violate the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.645" offset="1303970">It's the deliberate elicitation and use of statements obtained from the defendant that would violate the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.399" offset="1331033">So if a -- a cellmate, another defendant, is the informant who listens and hears, it wouldn't make any difference under the Court's cases if, in fact, it was a police officer pretending to be a cellmate who listens and hears, just as it wouldn't make -- it wouldn't be a violation if there were a recording device in the cell and the defendant talked to himself, which there are cases of that, and it was picked up on the recording device.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.097" offset="1425805">The mere listening -- that goes to whether there's a violation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.549" offset="1439598">But the who, there is -- it wouldn't matter for our purposes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="337.768" stopTime="349.559">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="337.768" offset="1456525">--So the police know that they -- they can get around the clear prohibition on their questioning without Miranda warnings by pretending to be a jailbird.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_mcallister" startTime="349.559" stopTime="366.104">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="349.559" offset="1503650">Potentially, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.678" offset="1512114">But, again, the -- the violation would go to what happens in the cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.063" offset="1529668">So if the police officer is pretending to be another defendant and sits in the cell and the defendant starts telling the officer things, that would not violate the Sixth Amendment at all under the--</text>

            <text syncTime="373.341" offset="1598736">In -- in this case, the -- the jail mate made a statement that encouraged the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.880" offset="1632904">He wasn't just passive.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.149" offset="1641994">He was encouraging the defendant to speak.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="386.517" offset="1651503">--There is certainly testimony about what he was told to do and what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.171" offset="1674073">It does not suggest aggressive efforts, certainly, to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.640" offset="1691941">He may not have been completely silent, but he certainly didn't say, tell me what you did, let's talk about your crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.694" offset="1716182">But he did make one arguably suggestive statement to the defendant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="407.098" stopTime="412.482">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="407.098" offset="1733841">Anyway, your answer is that a police officer could affirmatively elicit testimony?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_mcallister" startTime="412.482" stopTime="421.288">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="412.482" offset="1755366">No, not that he could affirmatively elicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.203" offset="1770203">That's the dividing line between the Massiah and Kuhlmann case.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.238" offset="1782324">If he was in the cell -- well, I guess what I'm suggesting--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="421.288" stopTime="440.800">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="421.288" offset="1790579">But you're -- you're talking about impeachment only.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.624" offset="1799879">We're not talking about the case-in-chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.474" offset="1807297">So if the police -- he can't -- outside, when he questions the defendant and gives no Miranda warnings, that's inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.400" offset="1867065">Right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_mcallister" startTime="440.800" stopTime="471.019">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="440.800" offset="1868633">--Outside of -- well, it would still be admissible for impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.370" offset="1882948">And we're asking for basically the same rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.270" offset="1890471">So it would be the same thing if he were in the cell, deliberately elicits, knows he's violating Massiah, it couldn't be used in the government's case-in-chief, but it could be used for impeachment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.695" offset="1932163">But that would be true of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.995" offset="1937387">If the officer deliberately failed to give the warnings, got a statement, they would not be admissible in the case-in-chief; but -- the Court cases are very clear -- they would be admissible for impeachment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.586" offset="1979810">So we're asking for the precise parallel rule.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="471.019" stopTime="474.656">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="471.019" offset="1989528">But you're -- you're making no distinction, then, between the Fifth and Sixth Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_mcallister" startTime="474.656" stopTime="518.167">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="474.656" offset="2004052">Well, there may be distinctions, and -- and there is an distinction in the text of the Fifth Amendment -- suggests actually a rule of exclusion when you truly have -- when there truly is a compelled statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.714" offset="2052326">And the Court has recognized that in cases such as Portash, where the -- the witness is given use immunity, testifies before the grand jury and the government later tries to use it against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.319" offset="2090674">The Court says, no, you cannot use that testimony for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.521" offset="2107496">So there is a difference between the Sixth Amendment and Fifth Amendment in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.557" offset="2119617">But what I was suggesting is the way Massiah and Miranda operate is similar in this context, that a violation results in suppression of the evidence from the government's case-in-chief, but it remains available for use as impeachment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="518.167" stopTime="527.273">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="518.167" offset="2178132">What about the argument that essentially this is like taking a pretrial deposition, only one side isn't represented?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_mcallister" startTime="527.273" stopTime="833.173">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="527.273" offset="2214494">Well, with all due respect to that argument, Your Honor, we disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.361" offset="2242915">There are strong incentives for the police, frankly, not to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.663" offset="2260052">And in part one of the reasons -- well, there's two.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.848" offset="2268829">One is the police know if this is truly in violation of the Sixth Amendment, then nothing can be used in the case-in-chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.586" offset="2295787">So, at most, it is impeachment if the defendant testifies and if the defendant testifies inconsistently with whatever is elicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.775" offset="2324522">But furthermore, given the line the court has drawn between Massiah and Kuhlmann and what goes on with the informant in the cell, if they can hear the statements without deliberately eliciting them, if you will, if the informant is present, the defendant wants to talk, starts chatting, they discuss the crime, those statements, the Court has held in Kuhlmann, are admissible for all purposes, because they are not a Sixth Amendment violation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.759" offset="2428489">So, the police do have some -- some strong incentives to actually try to gather the evidence, if they're going to, in a way that makes it usable in the prosecution's case-in-chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.698" offset="2468195">There's much less value to having it solely for impeachment, which is always going to be speculative if it would ever going to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.119" offset="2493900">It would depend on if the defendant testifies and if he testifies inconsistently with what he has told an informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.589" offset="2519813">And in that regard, there are other deterrents I'd like to mention here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.177" offset="2542174">The informant in this case, for example, in jail recognized that he did not want to be an aggressive questioner or -- or obvious as a government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.634" offset="2587941">In fact, he said, I didn't really want to ask him questions because I was afraid if he felt I was being too nosey, I might get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.990" offset="2617407">And so, the informants have their own incentives to be careful here.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.275" offset="2634543">And in this case, it's also important to remember that deterrence is simply one side of the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.231" offset="2666308">And the Court has said many times even if there would be some deterrent effect to extending the rule to include impeachment, that doesn't answer the question whether it should, in fact, be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.670" offset="2708104">That still must be weighed against the costs on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.205" offset="2722210">And the Court has numerous cases emphasizing the costs that are present on the other side of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.925" offset="2745093">Perjury by criminal defendants is a primary one, but also cases talking about the importance of allowing the jury to hear the truth and to search for truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.067" offset="2785740">The jury here gets to evaluate and did, I would argue, quite effectively from Mr. Ventris' standpoint, evaluate the informant's credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.589" offset="2827745">The jury was -- was informed, cross-examination of the informant's circumstances, what benefit he received, who he was, all -- all the things they might want to know in deciding whether to believe him.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.182" offset="2878109">His testimony went not solely but primarily to the question of who was the shooter in the murder in the case, and the jury acquitted Mr. Ventris of the murder charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.371" offset="2922935">So they did not believe, at least beyond a reasonable doubt, that he in fact was the shooter.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.875" offset="2940907">And that is precisely how this should work.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.144" offset="2953968">We're not saying informants are always 100 percent reliable, but we're saying the Court has a long tradition, the country has a long tradition of putting this evidence in front of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.052" offset="3001616">It's tested by crossexamination, knowledge of what the incentives are, bringing that out in front of the jury, and then the jury decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.640" offset="3032022">There are many of these cases where it's -- this was a typical, one codefendant saying, he was the shooter, the other defendant saying, no, she was the shooter.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.496" offset="3067444">And the informant simply had information that was relevant to the credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.298" offset="3086566">And that's the way it was used in this case, was as impeachment on rebuttal to evaluate Mr. Ventris's testimony and whether the jury believed him or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.923" offset="3129093">The other thing I would remind the Court is we are simply saying that the rule should be no exclusion under the Sixth Amendment for impeachment purposes, but that does not mean that the normal rules of evidence and other rules of trial procedure do not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.384" offset="3198997">They do.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.084" offset="3201714">And they might well result in the exclusion of some potential informant's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.204" offset="3222194">So if the government were to want to put on an informant who had been convicted many times of perjury and the judge said, no, I just do not think this evidence is credible enough to even put in front of the jury, not this person, the ordinary rules of evidence and trial procedure would operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.500" offset="3291470">Furthermore, as happened in this case, the judge can, and often will, give cautionary instructions, limiting instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.337" offset="3322817">All of that remains appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.356" offset="3330863">But there's simply no reason to exclude the evidence as a matter of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.760" offset="3356463">It would be inconsistent, frankly, with -- with, really, the general tone and holdings of the cases in the -- in the Fourth Amendment, Miranda, and even Sixth Amendment territory, including primarily Michigan v. Harvey and Nix v. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.769" offset="3412470">Unless the Court has further questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="849.449" offset="3503167">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has consistently allowed the use of voluntary statements obtained in violation of constitutional standards for impeachment purposes, and that same rule should apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.660" offset="3572025">There's no question that Respondent's statements were voluntary, and the substantial societal costs of allowing him to commit perjury unchecked greatly outweigh any speculative deterrence benefits that would flow from a per se rule of exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.605" offset="3635869">The purpose of the right to counsel is to provide an adversary process to ensure the defendant gets a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.276" offset="3666484">And to effectuate that right, the Court has excluded deliberately elicited statements from the government's case-in-chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.114" offset="3697831">But not allowing the statements for impeachment purposes doesn't further that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.351" offset="3718834">Instead, what it does is allow the defendant to distort the truth-seeking process, and that's just too high a price to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.772" offset="3748509">Well, you say there's no deterrent value, since the police are -- are not going to do this, that they know they're not going to be able to use this in their case-in-chief.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.060" offset="3873688">I mean, as this Court recognized in cases versus -- like Hudson v. Michigan, for example, the police have their own codes of conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.115" offset="4109834">You know, when this came up in the Kansas Supreme Court, it was a case of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.884" offset="4124985">And as General McAllister noted, there are a lot of reasons why the police would want to just follow the rule in Kuhlman and send the informant in to be a passive listening post because if--</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.605" offset="4247865">And then, of course, there are also State and the Model Professional Ethics Rules that talk about when a prosecutor can contact a person who is represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.311" offset="4286631">And there are limitations there as well, both in terms of the prosecutor contacting a person represented or using an agent contacting a person represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.132" offset="4317978">But I mean, those are -- those are deterrents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.634" offset="4327905">I think the police discipline is a deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.436" offset="4335114">But I think we also need to -- to focus on this Court's cases in the Fourth and Fifth and Sixth Amendment Jackson context that taking the evidence and making it unavailable in the government's case-in-chief is a substantial deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.826" offset="4384747">This Court said in each of those previous case that not having the evidence available in the government's case-in-chief is a very high price to pay, because that means that the government has to come up with other evidence that can meet its burden of proving all of the elements of the case beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.936" offset="4445142">And, as General McAllister noted, it's really very speculative, and the police certainly wouldn't know at the time they're asking questions of the defendant, whether this rebuttal impeachment evidence could ever be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.811" offset="4488714">It's entirely within the control of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.679" offset="4496133">It's only if the defendant -- if the government first meets its burden of proof with other evidence at trial, and then the defendant decides to testify, and then he testifies inconsistently with his prior statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.486" offset="4543363">And our position is at that point that the jury should hear the conflicting evidence just as it has heard it in all of these other previous cases and be allowed to make a decision about who's telling the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.411" offset="6875052">The prosecutor is still responsible for the informant because the informant is his agent, so even if -- when the informant goes ahead and deliberately elicits the statement, it's still a constitutional violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2511.012" offset="10149449">You said at least there should be a determination by the judge that the defendant intentionally testified falsely.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.784" offset="10384551">The issue is simply going to be whether or not the -- the States -- or the police agent is deliberately eliciting the statement or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.509" offset="10423421">So there -- there's likely going to be some kind of pretrial litigation regarding the admissibility of the statements, and it could be handled at that time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="2600.172" offset="10506073">Two quick points by way of rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.659" offset="10536061">The balancing of the interests here is sprinkling water under the bridge even in the Sixth Amendment context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.813" offset="10560721">In both Nix v. Williams and Michigan v. Harvey where the Court was dealing with Sixth Amendment interests and -- and Sixth Amendment right-to-counsel violations, both of those cases make clear that the question of what exclusionary effect to give a violation is subject to a balancing analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.493" offset="10639402">And that's what we're asking for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.793" offset="10644626">That's why it's treated for these purposes like the Fourth Amendment in the Miranda context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.880" offset="10664897">And Nix itself, to paraphrase the Court, makes a fundamental point which I think illustrates how this works, and it worked effectively to defendant's advantage in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.621" offset="10711918">In Nix v. Williams, the Court said the Sixth Amendment right to counsel -- and I'm paraphrasing slightly -- protects against unfairness by assuring an adversary process in which proffered evidence is tested by crossexamination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.763" offset="10764476">And it's done in front of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.881" offset="10772940">It is not about requiring the exclusion of entire categories of witnesses or types of evidence for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.403" offset="10807003">So the right to counsel was exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.855" offset="10820796">It was exercised effectively in this case when Mr. Doser was strongly cross-examined by defense counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2694.634" offset="10883908">But that's where the -- the police here and the prosecutor paid the price of the way in which the evidence was obtained.</text>
