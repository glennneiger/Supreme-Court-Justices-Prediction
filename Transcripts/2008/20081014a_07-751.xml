            <text syncTime="6.404" offset="132096">Mr. Stirba.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Stirba</label>
            <text syncTime="7.187" offset="135231">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At the time of the arrest in this case there were three different Federal circuits and two State courts that established it was Constitutionally permissible for police officers to enter a home without a warrant as a follow-up entry to effectuate arrest after an illegal drug transaction when a government agent had occurred and probable cause had been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.321" offset="247766">Although the rule has become known as the doctrine of consent once removed, and the lower courts have banned various rationales in support of the rule, the name or label is not important.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.747" offset="305445">What is important is that the rule is predicated upon well recognized Fourth Amendment principles, and that at the time of the arrest the consent doctrine was well established in the lower courts as settled Fourth Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.025" offset="374512">Thus, irrespective of how this Court rules on the constitutionality of the rule itself, the Petitioner officers could have reasonably believed that what they were doing was lawful.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="80.618" stopTime="96.878">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="80.618" offset="428952">Well, because the Fourth Amendment principle of consent was well established?</text>
            <text syncTime="85.939" offset="450163">In other words, if a police officer goes to the door and says "May I come in", that is -- that is perfectly acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.260" offset="479525">Is that -- that the level of generality that you think we ought to analyze this issue at?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_stirba" startTime="96.878" stopTime="131.050">
            <label>Mr. Peter Stirba</label>
            <text syncTime="96.878" offset="493944">No, certainly we think that the generality of just pure consent is not the level at which it should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.150" offset="522992">In fact, that was the problem with the Tenth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.483" offset="532396">But it has to be -- the right has to be defined in a specific clear way, and it has to be -- the contours of the right have to be sufficiently clear that police officers know that when they engage in the conduct, they know what they they're doing is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.910" offset="590075">In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, all of the law that was in existing at the time of the entry was supportive of exactly what the police officers did.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="131.050" stopTime="170.592">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="131.050" offset="630617">Well, it seems to me that misses the point of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.085" offset="642738">I mean, the point of the case is that consent to the police was established, consent to police informants was not, and that when I consent I am not consenting to the -- to the whole world.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.429" offset="700207">If I am consenting to somebody who is not a police officer, that is not equivalent to consenting to a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.333" offset="727792">That's the point of the case; and as I understand it, there was -- there was only one case at the time that this occurred which equated the confidential informant for the police with the police; and that was the Seventh Circuit case; isn't that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_stirba" startTime="170.592" stopTime="191.506">
            <label>Mr. Peter Stirba</label>
            <text syncTime="170.592" offset="788814">Justice Souter, we are not -- we are not contending this is an implied consent case, although that has been a theory that has been advanced in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.012" offset="818489">We believe that the way that this was constitutionally lawful -- this is really a Lewis case, and that is once you engage in some illegal conduct with a government agent in your home, you have waived any expectation of privacy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="191.506" stopTime="224.727">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="191.506" offset="872511">No, but that -- that equates -- in terms of existing law, that equates the government agent, which in this case is not a police officer, but a confidential informant, with a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.730" offset="925383">And it seems to me that is the nub of the case: Is that person equivalent, so that consent to one in effect is consent to as many police as want to come in, or is it not the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="216.204" offset="971254">And it seems to me what you have got to argue here is that the confidential informant and the police officer for Fourth Amendment purposes should be treated as identical.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.229" offset="1023394">There's one -- at the time that this search was made, as I understand it, there was only one case which held there was such an equivalence, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.016" offset="4154535">The mandatory order of decision for qualified immunity cases announced in Saucier v. Katz should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.420" offset="4180135">I did want to begin by clarifying the answer to your question, Justice Ginsburg, because I'm not sure if it was entirely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.491" offset="4204377">There were really two cases here, one of which was the criminal prosecution of Mr. Callahan, the Respondent in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.644" offset="4233007">And the individual officers were not parties as to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.215" offset="4247322">That was handled by the State of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.765" offset="4253487">And you're correct that in the criminal proceeding the consent once removed argument was not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.969" offset="4274280">And that led to the motion to suppress ultimately being granted and consequently Mr. Callahan was not subject to criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.308" offset="4307717">Mr. Callahan did file a civil suit against the individual officers who were involved in effecting the arrest, and in that civil proceeding the consent once removed argument was made all the way up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.830" offset="4353797">It was made in the district court, and it was made in the court of appeals as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.834" offset="4381800">Isn't the issue whether there was or was not probable cause quite separate from the consent once removed doctrine?</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.507" offset="4416491">What -- assuming that there was probable cause here, there may be many instances in which the consent once removed doctrine would be applied, if it's a valid doctrine, where there wasn't previously probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.197" offset="4467273">I think the consent once removed doctrine would have its greatest utility in cases where the police suspect but don't have probable cause to believe that a particular individual is engaged in criminal activity, and so they send an informant or an undercover police officer in to try to either confirm or dispel their suspicions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.478" offset="4544387">They wouldn't be able to get a warrant at the outset because they would not have probable cause at that time of ongoing criminal conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.343" offset="4643861">And one question that would bear on that would be, in these cases, is there difficulty or impossibility of getting a warrant under normal probable cause standards?</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.734" offset="4993379">--Well, I -- I would think that with either police officers or with informants you could have some situations in which the undercover operative has very recently attempted to confirm the presence of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.757" offset="5037474">And you can have other cases in which the undercover operative, again either an informant or a police officer, could hear rumors on the street that a particular individual was engaged in drug-dealing, might not have probable cause, and they might decide that the best way to set up the operation was to send this person in to attempt to make a buy at a time when probable cause was lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.854" offset="5121902">But they would want to arrange the operation in such a way that if the operative's experience confirmed their suspicions and gave them probable cause to arrest, they would be able to go in immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.478" offset="5168400">And our principal contention is not that the consent to the entry of Bartholomew was implicit consent to the later entry of the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.036" offset="5206538">It was that once a person has, even unknowingly, admitted a government agent into his home, his expectation of privacy is sharply reduced and the entry of the officers works an insubstantial incremental invasion of privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2737.783" offset="11057549">So that if in a case in which there is a search without a warrant, if you add up everything that individual officers knew and that amounts to probable cause, then the search is good.</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.695" offset="12821232">But I think in general we are talking about a very small category of cases like this one where their -- the criminal defendant won on the Fourth Amendment and then the police bring up some new argument on a qualified immunity defense because there would already be some law on the questions that were decided in the -- in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.477" offset="12912347">So in those limited circumstances it seems to put too much of a thumb on the scale on the side of police that says well, you can come up with a new theory and you don't even have to show that it applies; all you have to show is that nobody has ever rejected your theory and then it is not fairly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.189" offset="12987162">I don't think in that small number of cases that the balance should really tilt that far towards police.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.083" offset="13066783">It boils down to, in the absence of exigent circumstances, could any reasonable officer have believed that the two circumstances they would like to see in previous cases -- that is, that a confidential informant is inside, and that he sends a signal out that there is probable cause -- do those make any difference whatsoever to the calculation of whether there are exigent circumstances or consent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.330" offset="13159779">The answer is no and no reasonable officer could have believed otherwise.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Stirba</label>
            <text syncTime="3275.155" offset="13207113">The colloquy about the safety concerns when the officer or the confidential informer are in the home I think highlight why the distinction between a confidential informant and the officer really doesn't make much meaningful headway in terms of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.182" offset="13271165">Obviously if the police officer was acting under cover in this particular situation he would not have announced -- there were three arrestees who were actually in the premises at the time of the follow-up entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.757" offset="13321425">He would not have said after the drug transaction occurred</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.526" offset="13336576">"oh, by the way, I'm a police officer, I'm here to arrest you. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.346" offset="13351832">for obvious reasons connoting safety and other issues which would have been attendant to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.232" offset="13371371">Similarly the confidential informant isn't going to do that, either, for the same particular problem, even if the confidential informant had arrested powers under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.355" offset="13411913">The issue is the police officer can call up for backup and assistance to effectuate arrest, which is specifically what occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.228" offset="13447335">Similarly, there is no really distinction to be drawn between a confidential informant as a government actor allowing for the additional entry or follow-up entry of additional officers for backup and assistance to make sure the arrest is safe and secure than if you have a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.888" offset="13514000">The second point I would like to make is the first time any Federal circuit drew this distinction between a confidential informant and a police officer was the Tenth Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.962" offset="13562274">They adopted consent once removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.114" offset="13570947">They just limited it to a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.116" offset="13582858">Obviously the police officers involved in this case could not reasonably be expected to anticipate such a distinction being drawn, especially given the fact that there was at least a Seventh Circuit body of law, the Sixth Circuit body of law, and as we argue, which we think is a fair reading of Gramble -- because they cite the Seventh Circuit body of law that includes the confidential informant -- there were at least three circuits that rejected that distinction, and you in 2000 confirmed that in the Sixth Circuit there is no distinction as a matter of this particular doctrine between a confidential informant and a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.593" offset="13740847">And finally with respect to the exigent circumstances cases, and you can look at any one that was cited by the Respondent, there is no mention of Lewis, there is no mention of consent once removed, there is no mention of any abrogation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.888" offset="13813990">Those issues were not raised, just like the issues were not raised in the criminal appeal of Mr. Callahan's conviction; and so therefore they are really not relevant, they are not probative, and we are not suggesting this is an exigent circumstances case, nor are we suggest relying on for purposes of the Fourth Amendment issue any implied consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.218" offset="13899358">We have rested our -- the justification for the Fourth Amendment issue on search incident and also the Lewis doctrine because we think this is a Lewis case.</text>
