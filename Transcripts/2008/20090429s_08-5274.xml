            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinion of the Court this morning in Case 08-5274, Dean verus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.610" offset="30384">This is the case of the bumbling bank robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.530" offset="42048">Christopher Dean entered a bank, waved a gun, yelled for everyone to get down and started removing money from the teller stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.412" offset="73584">He grabbed bills with his left hand holding the gun in his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.533" offset="90000">As he was reaching over a teller to gather more money, the gun went off.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.772" offset="106992">Dean curst and dashed out of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.505" offset="117936">Witnesses later testified that he seemed surprised that the gun had gone off, no one was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.649" offset="142560">Congress had made it a crime to use or carry a firearm during and in relation to any violent or drug trafficking crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.785" offset="175104">An individual convicted of that offense receives a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, in addition to the punishment for the crime he committed using the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.263" offset="212976">The mandatory minimum increase was to seven years if the firearm is brandished and to ten years “if the firearm is discharged.”</text>
            <text syncTime="62.217" offset="248832">The question is whether a criminal receives the extra three years between brandishing and discharged for discharge of a firearm, if the discharge is an accident, we hold that he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.235" offset="296928">The statute applies, “if the firearm is discharged.”</text>
            <text syncTime="79.595" offset="318240">It does not require that the discharged be done knowingly or intentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.144" offset="336528">The passive voice is discharged, focuses on an event that occurs without respect to any actors intent or culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.846" offset="375264">Now, Dean argues that the provision should be limited to intentional discharges because there is a presumption that the Government must prove that a defendant intended to engage in criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.988" offset="419904">Well, it is unusual to impose punishment for purely accidental conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.363" offset="437328">It is not unusual to punish individuals for the unintended consequences of their unlawful acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.396" offset="465552">Here, the defendant is already guilty of unlawful conduct twice over, a violent or drug trafficking offense and the use of a firearm in the course of that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.342" offset="509328">The fact that the discharge may be accidental does not mean that the defendant is blameless.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.489" offset="529920">If you carry a gun to rob a bank and it goes off, you're responsible for the consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.735" offset="550800">A gunshot, whether accidental or intended, increases the risk that others will be injured, that people will panic, or that violence will be used in response.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.744" offset="590976">It also traumatizes bystanders as it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.773" offset="606960">Those criminals, who want to avoid the penalty for an inadvertent discharge, could lock or unload the firearm, handle it with care during their violent crime, leave the gun at home or best yet, avoid committing the felony in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.887" offset="667440">The mandatory minimum applies if a gun is discharged in the course of a violent or drug trafficking crime, whether on purpose or by accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.187" offset="700704">That was the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit below and the judgment of that Court is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.541" offset="726048">Justices Stevens and Breyer have filed descending opinions.</text>
