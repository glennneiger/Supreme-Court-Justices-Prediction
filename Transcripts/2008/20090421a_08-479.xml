            <text syncTime="3702.089" offset="14913766">There is an amicus brief that cites 189 school districts which have substantially limited strip searches, which proves the Ingraham v. Wright theory, which is that it will be taken care of at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.397" offset="14959010">But administrators, for now, need a bright-line rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.047" offset="14969563">And as to the scope, that bright-line rule is if you have reason to suspect that a student is processing contraband that poses a health and safety risk, then searching any place where that contraband may be reasonably hidden is constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.274" offset="15030481">And in any event, Mr. Wilson in this case certainly could have believed that the Constitution permitted it, Mr. Chief Justice, and so immunity is a foregone conclusion in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.730" offset="15072381">But I would ask the Court to rule on the constitutional question in the affirmative because it would further the interests of judicial economy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3762.794" offset="15156600">The additional issue, Justice Alito, on the factual question is I understand you're not talking about immunity, but the reality is we've got to be able to make decisions, and if we get sued on factual questions because somebody questions whether or not it's reasonable for us to search where contraband may be reasonably located, then we're going to end up in court anyway on those factual questions, which is going to -- you know, deter officials from acting immediately and effectively in those situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.580" offset="15275719">So, I do not think it is a factual question.</text>
