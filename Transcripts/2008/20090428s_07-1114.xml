            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="8.015" offset="32002">Twenty seven years ago, petitioner Gary Cone was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.808" offset="59169">Much of the delay in the execution of his sentence is attributable to the pretrial decision of Tennessee prosecutors not to disclose various police reports and witness statements that Cone contends were subject to disclosure under this Court's decision in Brady against Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.048" offset="140149">Cone first raised his Brady claim in a petition for state postconviction relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.828" offset="163241">The state court denied relief on the incorrect ground that the claim had been resolved in earlier state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.980" offset="195946">The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.472" offset="209844">Cone then sought relief in the federal court by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.450" offset="233772">The District Court held that Cone could not obtain federal relief on his Brady claim because the state court had denied the claim on procedural grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.910" offset="275568">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed concluding that the state court's dismissal of Cone's claim was barred on an inadequate and independent state ground -- ground but -- ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.968" offset="327812">We granted certiorari to answer the question whether a federal habeas claim is “procedurally defaulted” when it is twice presented to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.308" offset="373161">We now hold that the state court's rejection of Cone's Brady claim does not rest on a ground that bars federal review.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.117" offset="404404">We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court to make a full review of the suppressed evidence and to consider whether if it had not -- if it had been disclosed, it might have persuaded the jury to impose a noncapital sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.989" offset="471904">The Chief Justice has found an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.879" offset="487473">Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.819" offset="507221">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia has joined.</text>
