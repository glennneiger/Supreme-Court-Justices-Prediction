            <text syncTime="1206.570" offset="4933799">First, at the time that Officer Trevizo performed this frisk, the Arizona Court of Appeals erred when it held that the seizure that had been caused by the initial traffic stop was already over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.926" offset="4975177">This seizure was still ongoing at the time of the frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.561" offset="4985731">Second, regardless of the answer to that question, under this Court's decisions in Mimms and Wilson, it is constitutionally reasonable for a police officer to order any occupant out of a vehicle during a lawful traffic stop and to frisk that individual if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that that individual is armed and presently dangerous to the officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.416" offset="5225117">We would say that the fundamental reality of this situation is what the Court recognized in Brendlin, which is that, at the time the car pulls over, a reasonable person would understand himself to not be free to leave unless and until the police officer says something that makes fairly clear that the seizure is over and he's free to go.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.107" offset="14631915">--Well, let me give three quick answers to those: First of all, he looked -- this was an unmarked car, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.861" offset="14654903">I -- I think a -- a very reasonable inference is he looked behind because he was surprised that there were all of a sudden flashing lights and a siren on a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.200" offset="14684264">The gang colors, as the lower court -- the court of appeals here noted, although Mr. Johnson was wearing blue, the driver was wearing red.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.973" offset="14723344">If these were really gang colors, it -- it's not consistent with the conclusion that they were gang colors to have people of different colors who were rival gangs in the same car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.928" offset="14759184">And the third thing is, as lower courts have found, acknowledging prior criminal convictions is a basis for concluding that someone is not dangerous because they were forthcoming.</text>
