            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Souter has our opinion this morning in case 07-10441, Corley versus United States, which will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="9.411" stopTime="171.240">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.411" offset="143088">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.202" offset="166181">Federal law has long required that when a suspect is arrested on federal charges, the arresting officer bring him before a magistrate judge as soon as reasonably possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.928" offset="209126">In two cases, McNabb versus United States and Mallory versus United States, this Court has held that if arresting officers violate this law, any confession the suspect may give during the unreasonable delay is excluded from evidence and this is known as the McNabb-Mallory rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.430" offset="283105">In 1968, Congress considered changing the McNabb-Mallory rule as well as overruling our decision in Miranda versus Arizona and it passed 18 U.S.C. Section 3501.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.644" offset="339947">And the question in this case is whether 3501 did a way with McNabb-Mallory altogether or merely limited its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.817" offset="372652">The issue arose here because petitioner Corley confessed to a bank robbery nine and a half hours after his arrest but before being brought before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.276" offset="418523">The Third Circuit held his confession admissible concluding that Section 3501 eliminated McNabb-Mallory entirely, we disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.347" offset="458856">Section 3501 is not a model of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.095" offset="473799">Section 3501(a) says that any voluntary confession is admissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.017" offset="497518">But subsection 3501(c) says that no confession shall be inadmissible solely because of delay unless the delay exceeds six hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.200" offset="542239">If subsection (a) meant what it literally said, subsection (c) would be entirely superfluous because (a) would make any voluntary confession admissible regardless of whether they occurred within six hours of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.804" offset="592603">Giving (a) its literal scope would also eliminate some rules of evidence as it would make any voluntary confession admissible even if it were, for example, hearsay or protected by attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.475" offset="635340">We therefore read subsection (a) as doing nothing more than attempting to overrule Miranda and (c) is limiting McNabb-Mallory to confessions given over six hours after arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.683" offset="680166">Section 3501's legislative history confirms that this is what Congress intended and this reading ensures that the federal requirement of presenting an arrestee to a magistrate promptly retains some teeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.297" offset="738576">Now, we vacate and remand so the Third Circuit can apply the proper interpretation of Section 3501.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.454" offset="763235">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas joined.</text>
