            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Scalia has our opinion in case 07-1090, Republic of Iraq versus Beaty and the consolidated case.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="9.782" offset="145575">These two cases come to us on writs of certiorari for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.910" offset="178072">Respondents in these cases sued Iraq for monetary damages based on allegations of abuse and mistreatment by the Saddam Hussein regime during and following the first Gulf War.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.030" offset="234600">In order to bypass the immunity from suit that ordinarily attaches to foreign sovereigns, respondents invoked a now repealed statutory provision, 28 U.S.C. Section 1605(a)(7) that stripped sovereign immunity if the foreign states actions giving rise to the claims were taken out of time when the foreign state was designated as a sponsor of terrorism pursuant to certain statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.002" offset="358421">Iraq was so designated in 1990 and remained so during the period in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.401" offset="388096">Iraq argued, however, that this statutory exception was unavailable because in 2003, Congress authorized the President to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq "Section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or any other provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism."</text>
            <text syncTime="96.881" offset="493944">The President exercised that power with respect to all such provisions of law which in Iraq's view included the terrorism exception to foreign sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.364" offset="535949">But the Court of Appeals disagreed and allowed the suits to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.446" offset="552249">We granted certiorari and consolidated the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.608" offset="572834">Iraq's reading of the statutory authorization is the most straightforward reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.710" offset="597285">The terrorism exception to immunity is a provision of law and it applies to countries that have supported terrorism by virtue of their designation as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.346" offset="639812">Accordingly, when the President made inapplicable as to Iraq, all provisions of law that applied to countries that have supported terrorism that included Section 1605(a)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="145.394" offset="687982">The Court of Appeals interpreted the authorization more narrowly because its language -- the language authorizing the President to waive appeared in a proviso clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.722" offset="741376">And we have said, pursuant to ordinary English, that provisos are often meant to clarify or limit the effect of the proceeding principal clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.917" offset="790068">They -- they are often used that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.642" offset="796965">They should always be used that way but regrettably they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.538" offset="816609">The authorizations principal clause permitted the President to suspend the Iraq Sanctions Act but the proviso purported to grant the President an additional power here.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.178" offset="863107">Not the power, not to limit or restrain the principal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.190" offset="883169">We therefore reject the Court of Appeals' reading of the authorization statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.136" offset="903022">And we likewise reject the alternative unpersuasive constructions offered by respondents before this Court which I will not describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.441" offset="944191">A subsequent piece of legislation, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, purported to ratify the Court of Appeals' interpretation, but that statute has no bearing on our analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.797" offset="1005631">It was an extraordinary provision which said that nothing in Section 1503 has ever authorized directly or indirectly to making inapplicable of any provision chapter 97, waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.073" offset="1066757">But we think that has nothing to do with the present case because that statute in turn authorized the President to waive its application to Iraq and the President did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.971" offset="1118375">Finally, respondents contend that even if Iraq sovereign immunity was restored by the President's actions, these actions sees to have force once the statutory authorization to waive expired via sunset provision in 2005.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.730" offset="1189324">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.870" offset="1197892">The statute provided that the authorities it granted would expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.803" offset="1213670">That is the President's authority to waive the application of the laws but it did not unlike at least one analogous statute also mandate a similar expiration for the waivers issued pursuant to those expired authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.982" offset="1286395">As a result, Iraq's sovereign immunity was restored when the President exercised his authority to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision of law that applies to countries that have supported terrorism.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.555" offset="1336654">The courts below therefore lost jurisdiction over the suits and should have dismissed the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.396" offset="1360060">The judgments of the Court of Appeals are reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.597" offset="1372808">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
