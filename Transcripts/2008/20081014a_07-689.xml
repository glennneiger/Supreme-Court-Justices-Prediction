            <text syncTime="2855.233" offset="11527335">The first is to provide State and local legislatures, as well as the courts, with a baseline against which to when a section 2 District must be drawn in the first place, when to engage in this race conscious exercise in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.873" offset="11573938">Second, it raises the serious Constitutional concerns identified in LULAC, especially because it combines not only racial gerrymandering but with political-party gerrymandering all at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.146" offset="11619077">And third, it requires difficult predictive judgments about how people would react, how people would vote in a future proposed district, something that is not required under the traditional Gingles analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.970" offset="11666307">And these problems would exist nationwide because section 2 applies to every districting done in every jurisdiction and every -- nationwide, be it a county, city, or locality or down to the school-board or town-council level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.845" offset="11713849">Now, under the first of those points, under the traditional Gingles test, the scope of consideration of race and other things, as well as the majority limit of the districts -- and that provides an -- an easy focal point that anyone drawing a district knows.</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.472" offset="13500312">But now that race relations have improved and there is much more crossover voting, we should now require greater consideration of race as well as partisanship than had ever been done before under the same unamended statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.054" offset="14014610">Let me start first of all with Justice Breyer's question about the arbitrary nature of the 50 percent rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.124" offset="14038956">The 50 percent rule, let there be no doubt, is extremely arbitrary, even under the government's 2 percent cushion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.813" offset="14069676">What would happen is you have a district that is 40 percent -- 46 percent African American, that district could be freely carved off into two districts of 23 percent each, neither of which would provide an equal opportunity to elect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.989" offset="14126414">Even when you are in a situation like this case, where the district is actually functioning and has a proven ability to elect a minority preferred candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.262" offset="14163508">Moreover--</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.612" offset="14168942">Wouldn't Justice Breyer's 40 percent rule be just as arbitrary?</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.249" offset="14195482">--Justice Alito, it is important to recognize that there are significant districts that are out there that would not be protected under the 50 percent rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.240" offset="14243443">And I understand the Court's desire to have some sort of limitation on the size of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.310" offset="14267685">We believe it is already in there, in place as a result of the LULAC decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.947" offset="14286284">It's in place because in North Carolina, as a practical matter, you can't go much below 40 percent and have a district that will actually work.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher G. Browning, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3554.384" offset="14324005">The voting age population is 39.36 percent based upon the census data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.724" offset="14357337">The government wants to use a 2 percent cushion as their threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.294" offset="14383668">But there is some significant problems with that, because when you look at the overcount of white voters, the Census Bureau recognizes the lower count is basically 2 percent there in and of itself, then there are some undercounted black voters is a 1 percent undercount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.570" offset="14444690">So even a 48 percent doesn't even get anywhere close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.089" offset="14462767">Moreover, you have districts where there are a number of eligible -- number of people that are counted in the census that are not truly eligible to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.563" offset="14504667">That is reflected in the brief by the States at page 28 in footnote 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.734" offset="14533402">The States make the point that there are many districts where we have military bases, we have colleges that cause this to be an extremely arbitrary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.340" offset="14567779">And in North Carolina there are districts where once you remove the military base where most of the population will not be voting in that district, there is a shift of even 12 percent in the minority voting age population increasing by 12 percent once you just remove the military bases from the equation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3651.330" offset="14711766">Justice Breyer, in our view the rule that should be applied is consistent with the rule of LULAC, that the minority group is substantially larger than its coalition partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.903" offset="14758055">Here the minority group is 39.36 percent African American.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.589" offset="14776759">It only requires an additional roughly 11 percent white crossover voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.426" offset="14800165">So the white crossover voting that is needed is only a third of the size of the minority group.</text>
