            <text syncTime="4.602" offset="123862">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1996, Congress provided in 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(3)(B) that courts may stay an alien's order of removal pending appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.878" offset="180914">The question in this case is whether Congress intended that temporary stays of removal be governed by the normal standards applicable to stays or, instead, by the special standard that Congress separately set forth for injunctions in 1252(f)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="34.404" offset="243085">There are three primary reasons why the normal stay standard should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.189" offset="262207">First, Congress used different words to describe these different forms of relief, (b)(3)(B) and (f)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="48.062" offset="297629">Congress used different words because it saw these forms of relief as different.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.847" offset="312780">Second and related, a stay is, in fact, different from an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.318" offset="330648">It is a temporary vacatur of a court or agency order pending review.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.388" offset="351023">It is not directed at a party and does not order a party to take action.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.422" offset="367114">Third, even an alien with a strong likelihood of success on the merits who will face certain persecution, if deported, cannot get a stay under the (f)(2) standard, a result Congress should not be presumed to authorize in the absence of a clear statement to that effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.350" offset="754772">And -- and I think it's important that stays are, in fact, denied under the traditional standard, because what that demonstrates is that the traditional standard effectuates Congress' purpose of passing IIRIRA and eliminating the automatic stay and making it, in fact, more difficult for an individual to obtain a stay on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.747" offset="832408">That -- the traditional standard does have real teeth and it does not result in an automatic stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.690" offset="900221">Congress both eliminated the automatic stay, and it replaced it with the language in 1252(b)(3)(B), which indicates that a stay is not automatic unless a court orders otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.080" offset="945779">And -- now, that language was nearly identical to the language that had previously existed, where a stay was automatic except for aggravated felons.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.753" offset="980470">For aggravated felons, the statute provided that a stay was not automatic unless a court otherwise directs.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.323" offset="1006696">And courts had interpreted that language to provide for application of the traditional stay standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.613" offset="1047865">You have a more appealing fact case than is typical because yours involves a denial of a motion to reopen and doesn't really go to the ultimate merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.034" offset="1085586">Most of the petitions, I think, do go to the ultimate merits, and it's easier to see that (f)(2) may apply there as opposed to your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.342" offset="1122785">Now, is there a coherent way of saying that?</text>
            <text syncTime="257.544" offset="1135637">In other words, in your type of case, you apply the traditional stay standards, but in a case where the issue that is before the court is whether to order removal or not on the merits, the -- the other approach applies.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.590" offset="1211810">And where the alien is seeking to enjoin his or her removal, the (f)(2) standard makes a lot of sense, but the (f)(2) standard doesn't contain any predictive language.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.863" offset="1264891">I mean, it -- my understanding is that situations in which they're going to be seeking an injunction to enjoin are actually quite limited.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.522" offset="5743532">Indeed, if section 1252(f)(2) does not apply to such an order barring removal, it is difficult to see what function it would serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.044" offset="5777596">Now, Petitioner's counsel has suggested that 1252(f)(2) must be directed to what I think had been referred to as fluke kind of district court orders, and couldn't really be directed at the situation that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.554" offset="5835588">There are two very powerful responses to that, if I make -- may make them both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.356" offset="5854814">The first is that subsection (f)(2), which appears on page 14a of our brief, refers -- it says no court shall enjoin the removal, et cetera, under this section, meaning that the provision is specifically directed to court orders that are entered as part of the proceedings on judicial review of final orders under section 1252.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.805" offset="5948646">It's not -- it's not principally directed at collateral orders that might arise in some other class action or other sort of suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1508.388" offset="6138922">The question in several of them was whether the separate provision 1252(g), which this Court discussed in the American-Arab case, whether that applied, and there was -- at least one of the cases involved the transitional rules under which (f)(2) doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.081" offset="6205795">But I think the -- the more fundamental answer to your point was the second point that I was -- that I was going to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.134" offset="6225962">There are -- there are three provisions of section 1252 that make unmistakably clear that Congress did not intend any challenge to a final order of removal, any form of judicial review which would include an injunction to take place outside of 1252 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.512" offset="6299418">And 1252(a)(1) provides that judicial review shall be pursuant to chapter 158 of -- and that's on page 1a of the brief -- shall be pursuant to chapter 158 of title 28, the Hobbs Judicial Review Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.106" offset="6361799">But -- and then (a)(5), which is on page 4a of our brief, says notwithstanding any other provision of law, a petition for review filed with an appropriate court is the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of the removal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.983" offset="6429403">Unless there be any doubt, the last sentence in that section says, for purposes of this entire chapter, anytime there's a reference to judicial review, it refers to any sort of statutory or nonstatutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.493" offset="6487395">So anytime an alien would try to get an injunction in any form of judicial review, Congress has expressly barred it not only by this, but then also by section (b)(9) -- subsection (b)(9).</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.202" offset="6946210">And they go to a reviewing court, which is going to be a habeas corpus court, and that court decides, the alien is right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2386.587" offset="9651764">It has a substantive standard that the alien has to make a clear and -- has to show by clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.991" offset="9677364">It -- it presupposes that the alien has to make a showing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.497" offset="9707457">We also believe that it presupposes that the government is permitted to respond to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.485" offset="9727310">So we -- we do not object and have not objected in the lower courts to the courts taking sufficient time to -- to freeze the status quo by issuing a -- a short stay if necessary to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.308" offset="9782690">Now, in the -- in the Eleventh Circuit, for example, which has operated under this heightened showing for some period of time, it tends to work out, because when a -- a petition for review and stay application is granted, the court contacts the Office of Immigration Litigation which works with DHS to inform the court of how soon the -- the order might be issued, and then the court is aware of how quickly it might act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2481.715" offset="10032316">But the -- but the second point I think that -- that reinforces this proposition -- again, if you go back to the Hobbs Judicial Review Act, it has a provision not only for interlocutory injunctions, which is what we're really talking about here, but a provision for temporary -- for a court to issue a temporary stay upon a showing of irreparable injury to allow the status quo to be maintained pending the court's ruling on the interlocutory injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2517.907" offset="10177034">Well, it may -- that may well be the right answer, is to read (b)(3)(B) -- (b)(3)(B)'s opening that -- which says a petition for review does not in itself stay the order -- is -- is very similar to the language in the opening of 2349(b) which is the interlocutory injunction language of the Hobbs Judicial Review Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.885" offset="10256969">It says the mere filing of the petition doesn't stay or suspend the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.439" offset="10275150">It says stay or suspend the order like this says stay, and then it says, but a court may -- I forget the precise language -- restrain or suspend the order pending judicial review, and it refers to that as an interlocutory injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.830" offset="10324783">But it says if the petitioner shows irreparable injury would occur before the court has a chance to rule even on the interlocutory injunction, it can issue what's called a temporary stay to maintain the status quo until it can look at the -- at the interim relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.375" offset="10390925">Well, if -- if that -- if that background rule is not displaced, that would allow for some separation of the sort of emergency motion for a stay, a hold-fast sort of situation, for the court to be able to evaluate the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.718" offset="10448290">But when it gets to what the Hobbs Act refers to as an injunction, then (f)(2) kicks in the interlocutory injunction pending -- pending judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.157" offset="10486011">So that would be -- that would be an underlying statutory basis for allowing the court to -- to issue a temporary order to allow the -- to allow the proceeding to go forward, but we think that that should be done in a timely way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.715" offset="10544316">The Hobbs Judicial Review Act contemplates a rather casual, up to 60 days that such a temporary stay should remain in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.955" offset="10585276">We think in many cases, under the immigration laws, the court should be able to act on the stay application more quickly than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.875" offset="10612966">I did want -- I did also want to stress the -- the policy purposes that Justice Kennedy raised in a -- in an earlier question, and that is the -- the thrust -- the whole thrust of the 1996 amendments to the Immigration Act was to expedite the removal of aliens, particularly criminal aliens, but not all -- but all aliens in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.891" offset="10705021">And Congress did several things when it did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.760" offset="10716411">It repealed the prior provision that said the mere filing of petition for review automatically stayed the removal unless the court ordered -- ordered otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.282" offset="10754550">And it also repealed the prior provision that said that the alien -- if the alien left the country, including -- that was construed to mean pursuant to deportation order, he could no longer challenge the removal order outside the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.923" offset="10805123">Congress completely changed that and it said you can now challenge the order of removal from outside the country, and it basically reversed the presumption with respect to whether -- whether the filing of a petition for review stays -- stays the order of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.318" offset="10870742">Congress said, no, it does not unless the court ordered otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2701.407" offset="10911075">It says that no automatic stay unless the court otherwise orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2768.533" offset="11179510">It provides a -- it prohibits courts from enjoining or restraining the operation of part 4 of the INA which -- which is the provision that deals with deportation -- adjudication of deportation and exclusions and carrying out those orders, which, by the way, we think is the reason it says enjoin or restrain because it's talking about programmatic type actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.433" offset="11279193">And restrain -- the word (f)(2) because it -- because what's being enjoined or stayed is a very discreet act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.593" offset="11339797">You either have an injunction barring removal or -- or you don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.295" offset="11354634">But I -- I think a further answer to your question, Justice Ginsburg, is that (f)(2) says, under this section, which means that it is obviously referring to court orders entered in the course of -- of removal proceedings under section 1252.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.590" offset="11419732">And when -- when a court finally gets to the merits on -- in a petition for review in a court of appeals, the -- the court, if it decides that there's a flaw -- excuse me -- a legal flaw in the -- in the BIA or immigration judge's decision, it vacates the decision and -- and remands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.302" offset="11494651">Injunctions are not necessary in that -- in that kind of review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2876.837" offset="11612724">The way -- the way I would understand it to operate is that the -- the alien would have to make a clear and convincing showing that he's entitled to have the motion to reopen granted because if the motion to reopen is granted, that vacates the final order of removal and, therefore, there is no longer a final order of removal pursuant to which the alien could be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.019" offset="11705511">And I did want to respond to your suggestion that maybe the standard should be more lenient with respect to motions to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.238" offset="11726409">With respect, I think that's the opposite of what the rule should be, if anything, because the -- the final -- the review of the final order of removal is the main show, and in that -- in that situation, the alien is actually challenging the order of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.564" offset="11779699">In a case like this where the order of removal was a long time ago, and the -- and the -- the alien sought judicial review of that and that was denied, the only thing before the court is the -- is the motion to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.823" offset="11836750">And staying -- a judicial order staying the denial of a motion to reopen is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.061" offset="11861619">In order to get the relief preventing removal, you need a stay of removal, which -- which really effectively directs DHS, as we think it does in all cases -- directs DHS not to execute the order of removal that was -- that was already previously entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.273" offset="11930478">And also, the denial of a motion to reopen, especially one like the one at issue in this case, where the question is whether the alien has shown -- has produced material evidence of changed circumstances -- that's reviewed, as this Court said in its decision in Abudu, under an abuse of discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.048" offset="11993590">So it would be very likely -- very unlikely that an alien would prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.702" offset="14324234">I believe habeas is one example -- and habeas in the expedited removal context, where the provision would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.458" offset="14351297">And -- and I think, as this Court made clear in St. Cyr, Congress did intend for some habeas actions to persist in the '96 IIRIRA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.079" offset="14393720">And in those cases, (f)(2) would apply, would have real impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.383" offset="14410961">And I would also note that if the Court were to accept the government's interpretation of the term "enjoin", that it only applies in stays and that it doesn't have application elsewhere, then you'd be required to interpret Congress' use of the word "enjoin" to be not merely inclusive of stays but as coterminous with the -- with the word "stay".</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.345" offset="14486821">But Congress didn't use the word (f)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.797" offset="14496643">It used the word "enjoin".</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.631" offset="14499986">And the fact that that word choice was different from the word it used in (b)(3)(B) I think is a clear indication that Congress had something different in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.737" offset="14528408">It didn't cross-reference "stays".</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.203" offset="14534259">It didn't use the word "stays", and it articulated a standard that seems more appropriate for district courts adjudicating permanent injunctive relief than courts of appeals hearing a temporary application for a stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3629.685" offset="14624120">The word -- there is substantial likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm -- that that's -- that's the standard preliminary injunction, not preliminary stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3649.597" offset="14703846">There -- there is overlap, and the standard that is applied by the courts, if there is no statute to the contrary, is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.919" offset="14729132">But here, Congress expressed an intent to treat injunctive relief differently and articulated a standard that was higher for injunctive relief.</text>
