            <text syncTime="36.454" offset="255331">If -- if I should modify it, please -- please let me know.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.172" offset="270169">The court of appeals in this case made two fundamental and separate errors, each of which should require reversal of its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.278" offset="302665">First, all agree that the question whether title IX precludes the use of section 1983 to enforce the Constitution is a matter of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.218" offset="338401">Yet, the court of appeals entirely disregarded all of the ordinary indicia of congressional intent: the statutory text; the statutory background, structure, and evolution; the unquestioned legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.574" offset="379779">Each of these considerations points conclusively towards a single outcome: Congress did not mean title IX to preclude the use of section 1983 to enforce the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.179" offset="414260">Second, rather than consider any of this direct and compelling evidence of what Congress actually had in mind in title IX, the court of appeals applied what it thought to be a presumption that the availability of title IX's implied right of action to enforce title IX's own statutory prohibition of gender discrimination somehow should be taken to mean that Congress meant to preclude the use of section 1983 to enforce constitutional rules against discrimination.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="103.865" offset="525019">Counsel, there's -- there's a little bit of an air of unreality about all this, because, of course, Congress didn't provide a cause of action in title IX to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.202" offset="558352">And the reason they don't have all these limitations and restrictions is because they didn't put in the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.874" offset="584997">We implied it from the statute, and so it seems kind of awkward to say, well, there are no limitations, as I said, when there was no cause of action.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="128.147" stopTime="150.161">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="128.147" offset="622090">Well, I -- I guess there -- there are a number of points that I -- I can make in response to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.301" offset="642675">First of all, I think what -- what you say is absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.118" offset="649989">Congress did not expressly provide a cause of action in title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.353" offset="662946">And so since -- since the question in a preclusion case, the question of whether or not Congress meant to preclude the use of section 1983, is whether there is a clear indication of congressional intent to do so, that there -- as a matter of definition, that can't be present here.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.161" offset="710175">Maybe the question ought to be whether this Court intended to have the title IX action, which it invented, preclude 1983.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>

            <text syncTime="170.807" offset="792722">--No, I -- I don't agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.426" offset="799201">I -- I do think -- and -- and -- this is not my principal point, but I do think it's quite clear that if we are talking about what is the clear intent of Congress regarding preclusion of use of section 1983, the fact that Congress did not expressly create a -- a private right of action at all bears very significantly on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.388" offset="867119">I don't at all disagree that Congress intended and expected that the courts would recognize a right of action under -- under title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.625" offset="896063">But Congress actually in title IX specifically, I think, addressed the preclusion question that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.046" offset="917692">There is clear statutory text that answers the question in this case in -- in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.350" offset="938904">First of all, when Congress enacted title IX, it specifically provided that -- it specifically contemplated that there would be continued, private constitutional litigation challenging gender discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.590" offset="987909">It specifically authorized the attorney general to intervene in private litigation whenever -- and I am here quoting from the text of the statute -- whenever suit is initiated in any court of the United States to assert rights, the deprivation of equal protection under the -- under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution on account of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.369" offset="1067008">Congress, therefore, specifically contemplated, when it enacted title IX, that there would be -- there would, in fact, be constitutional litigation challenging gender discrimination on account of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.360" offset="1106923">And Congress surely knew that that litigation would proceed under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.711" offset="1124373">Respondents--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="254.496" offset="1127508">Did we rely on that provision in implying the right of action under title IX?</text>

            <text syncTime="258.448" offset="1143286">--The -- the Court did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.650" offset="1152167">I mean there, the -- the Court looked at what it took to be the general -- the manifest congressional intent when -- when it enacted title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.904" offset="1185081">But it did not specifically rely on -- on the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.125" offset="1198038">The legislation, of course, goes to whether or not section 1983 suits were available, not to whether there is a title IX implied right of action available.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.362" offset="1223011">And, as I say, in that -- in that legislative language, Congress made expressly clear that it intended -- and intended actually to facilitate by allowing the attorney general to intervene in -- continued section 1983 litigation to enforce allegations of -- of gender discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.971" offset="1289362">Mr. Rothfeld, I follow your argument entirely, and then in the civil rights area there are a lot of overlapping statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.810" offset="1324784">You can sue under title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.179" offset="1330218">It doesn't take away your right under 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.548" offset="1343697">But in this case, if we get down to what this case is about, we have a determination by a court that the school district acted reasonably in relation to these complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.058" offset="1401793">And then you say: But we have constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.443" offset="1415272">A constitutional claim requires you to show deliberate, intentional conduct if it's an individual; if you are talking about an institution, some kind of not just one incident, but a custom, a pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.023" offset="1497610">What, when you get down to the merits, is different about those?</text>
            <text syncTime="353.910" offset="1525196">In other words, is it on the wrong track to talk about precluding a statute instead of talking about just plain old issue preclusion?</text>
            <text syncTime="364.968" offset="1569395">What is different about 1983?</text>
            <text syncTime="368.253" offset="1582561">Yes, you have two claims, but if you lose under IX, you are going to lose under 1983 as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.262" offset="1642538">The -- the First Circuit in this case resolved the title IX claim focusing on deliberate indifference in response to peer-on-peer sexual harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.004" offset="1685483">To the extent that there is a federal constitutional claim growing out of that conduct of the same sort and to the extent that the elements of that claim are identical, then we agree that at that point that would be precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.593" offset="1723935">But we think that there is more to this case than that one issue that has been resolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.283" offset="4050610">But before you even get to that point, there is this express evidence in the statutory text of title IX that Congress did not mean to preclude use of section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.723" offset="4084360">First, there is the provision that I mentioned regarding the attorney general, which -- which expressly contemplates there will be continued section 1983 constitutional gender discrimination after the enactment of title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.662" offset="4128141">I think that in and of itself is dispositive and tells the Court all it needs to know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1010.685" offset="4152278">Beyond that, there is the language of the antidiscrimination provision of title IX, which was borrowed directly, is identical to the language of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.825" offset="4200866">Congress dropped the phrase</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.127" offset="4218002">that appears in title VI and substituted IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.062" offset="4229810">And, so, the Court has recognized that Congress expected and intended that title IX would be interpreted just as -- as had been title VI.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.489" offset="4283517">There have been -- as we cite in our brief, as the American Bar Association cites in its amicus brief supporting us, the American Civil Liberties Union cites in its brief -- there have been almost two dozen cases decided before the enactment of title IX in which courts allowed the simultaneous assertion of statutory discrimination claims under title VI and section 1983 discrimination claims under title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.319" offset="4370766">There had not been a single suggestion by any decision that there might possibly be preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.306" offset="4390724">And so, at the time that Congress used the language of title IX, it knew that that language had been uniformly, widely construed across the country to allow the simultaneous assertion of those claims, not the preclusion of section 1983 claims for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.732" offset="4456448">And so it's when Congress -- when legislative language has been the subject of judicial construction, as the Court has said many times, and Congress repeats that language in a new statute, its expectation and intention is that the judicial construction is going to be taken as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.360" offset="4523008">And so that I think that is also dispositive of the question in this case, because Congress chose language that it necessarily knew had been understood not to preclude the use of section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.751" offset="4572536">And I will mention as well, just to sort of throw in the suspenders along with the belt, an additional consideration that the court of appeals ignored here was the manifest legislative purpose of section -- of title IX, which was to expand and strengthen protections against discrimination in schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.280" offset="4750587">First, as I say, there is this direct evidence of what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.316" offset="4762812">It specifically referred to constitutional litigation under the Fourteenth Amendment when it enacted title IX, and, therefore, by definition it could not have been concerned about evasion in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.623" offset="4803981">But I think that there -- IX; on the other, there are pre-existing constitutional rights--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="1182.377" offset="4838985">And those constitutional rights have -- I think it might be -- it's at least arguable that it would be harder to win a 1983 case, given that, as to the individual, you have qualified immunity, and, as to the institution, you have to show a custom or practice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="1200.357" stopTime="1436.659">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="1200.357" offset="4910979">--Well, the only availability for individual liability is under the Constitution, because title IX, at least as construed by the lower courts, does not permit suits directly against the individual, only against the institution, which I think is a significant distinction between the two and supports the argument that Congress could not have intended to preclude it because, as the Court has recognized, repeatedly, the availability of individual liability greatly adds to the -- the deterrence, the effect of deterring constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.643" offset="5032082">And the suggestion that, when Congress enacted title IX, it would have -- it meant to have the perverse effect of allowing a school, by accepting federal funds, to insulate school policymakers from any personal statutory liability, you know, for even the most blatant and obvious acts of unconstitutional sex discrimination would turn title IX on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.591" offset="5131870">It's inconceivable that Congress could have had that intent in mind when it enacted a statute that was clearly designed to expand and strengthen protections against gender discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.364" offset="5163008">I'll make sort of two additional points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.185" offset="5186205">As I -- as I suggest, I think the direct evidence in the statutory text, as well as the legislative purpose, is dispositive here and the Court need not go beyond that to answer the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.643" offset="5236046">That leaves the question of how the court of appeals got the matter so far wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.195" offset="5250257">And I think that the reason that they did is, ignoring the text, they applied what they thought to be a presumption derived from this Court's decisions in cases like Smith v. Robinson and the Palos Verdes case that the creation of a new statutory right and a new statutory remedy necessarily reflects a congressional intent to preclude the use of section 1983 to enforce overlapping constitutional remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.826" offset="5352866">There has never been such a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.762" offset="5364569">The Court has said repeatedly, I think, as was suggested earlier in the discussion, that when Congress creates new statutory rights and new statutory remedies, they are presumed to overlap with and to supplement existing statutory rights and remedies, unless the two are positively repugnant to one another, unless they are inconsistent and can't be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.974" offset="5437398">That certainly is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.259" offset="5442518">The section 1983 constitutional claims and title IX supplement and complement each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.080" offset="5465819">The two statutes are by no means coterminous in who can be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.234" offset="5486404">The Court has certainly never presumed that the creation of any statutory right or statutory remedy bars the use of section 1983 to enforce the Constitution, as suggested by Justice Ginsburg's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.974" offset="5541366">The Court has only once in well more than a century that section 1983 has been on the books held that availability of the constitutional remedy had been precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.163" offset="5578146">As I say, Congress promptly responded by providing that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.301" offset="5594760">The Palos Verdes decision, which was the fulcrum of the court of appeals' decision, I think suggests what's wrong with its analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.721" offset="5624435">Palos Verdes involved a new statutory right, a new statutory action to enforce that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.025" offset="5645646">The statutory action was limited in significant respects, and the Court concluded, as a matter of common sense, that one could infer from that situation Congress intended that the new right -- with the new remedial system would be exclusive, otherwise plaintiffs could immediately go to court and render that system a dead letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.605" offset="5723909">But, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his opinion for the Court, that holding had no effect whatsoever on section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.526" offset="5755570">It meant that Congress had placed the new remedy outside of section 1983's remedial framework, but that claims that were available prior to the existence of that new right, prior to the creation of that new right, remained available under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.936" offset="5805307">And that is exactly the situation that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.752" offset="5812517">Plaintiffs are not trying to allege a new statutory right that is outside the section 1983's remedial framework; instead, they are asserting fundamental, pre-existing constitutional rights.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="3381.402" offset="13635145">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.056" offset="13653744">And I'll try not to use my extra 10 seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.756" offset="13660536">Two principal points: First, on the proper disposition of this case, the First Circuit's holding -- and I'm reading from page 24a of the petition appendix:</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.780" offset="13708601">"The comprehensiveness of Title IX's remedial scheme. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.482" offset="13719468">"indicates Congress saw Title IX as the sole means of vindicating the constitutional right to be free from gender discrimination perpetrated by educational institutions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.105" offset="13749979">"It follows that the plaintiffs' equal protection claims are precluded. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.874" offset="13761055">That was not a holding that had to do with claim preclusion, issue preclusion, collateral estoppel; it was a holding that constitutional claims simply cannot go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.479" offset="13795432">So there are constitutional claims that were advanced below, argued to both courts, have not been discussed by any court at any point, and I think the proper disposition here -- the most regular course in a case of this sort to is decide the question presented, send the case back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.703" offset="13844334">It certainly is not the case -- it's a commonplace that the Court has threshold questions that are presented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.274" offset="13870561">There are remaining issues that have to be resolved on -- on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.726" offset="13884458">It's certainly not the Court's usual practice to decide whether or not the plaintiffs can -- can prevail on those claims on remand before deciding the threshold questions on which cert was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.765" offset="13920611">I think that's the appropriate approach for the Court to take here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.402" offset="13935135">On the merits, very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.185" offset="13942241">Again, I think we have here the gold standard of evidence as to preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.639" offset="13960108">We have express statutory text that deals with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.706" offset="13968363">My learned colleague suggested that the Attorney General intervention provision was somehow limited to cases involving claims by schools that don't accept Federal funds or somehow are not subject to title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.297" offset="14010681">That is not the language of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.914" offset="14017160">The provision says whenever -- whenever a claim is initiated in a court of the United States asserting deprivation of rights, equal protection on account of sex, the Attorney General can intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.672" offset="14056239">Clearly, Congress had it in mind that there would be such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.624" offset="14068046">And this was enacted as part of title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.909" offset="14077137">This was enacted as part of the statute that creates rights against discrimination by schools receiving Federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.479" offset="14103468">It makes no sense to suggest that Congress--</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.931" offset="14113290">Well, does that provision apply only when there is a title IX cause of action?</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.653" offset="14248082">Oh, you don't think they mean whether there's a -- there's a valid claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.038" offset="14261666">Even when there is a claim that isn't allowed under the law?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="3541.156" offset="14274100">--I am suggesting that the language says that whenever a claim of gender discrimination is advanced under the Constitution, the Attorney General can intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.530" offset="14315687">I think what we draw from that is that Congress imagined that there would be continued constitutional litigation involving gender discrimination after they enacted title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.118" offset="14345989">And because that provision was added to the law as part of title IX, Congress surely contemplated that these suits would involve gender discrimination involving schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.457" offset="14375351">The other sort of clear textual indication which I -- again, my learned colleague has not really discussed, is the title VI history of enforcement prior to the enactment of title IX, which was absolutely consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.198" offset="14430312">There are almost two such dozen decisions, which, this Court suggested in Cannon, it is not only appropriate but realistic to think that Congress was aware of at the time it enacted title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.405" offset="14467093">Those decisions clearly indicated that there was no preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.338" offset="14478900">The language of title VI and title IX is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.873" offset="14489036">There can be no doubt, I think, that Congress would have had it in mind that preclusion is not appropriate in this context as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.777" offset="14512650">And one final, very quick point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.463" offset="14519338">This is an implied right of action; to suggest that Congress meant to preclude the use of the Constitution to enforce the -- preclude section 1983 to enforce the Constitution while leaving it to the courts to imply the alternative remedy and to devise the contours on and the limitations on that remedy, would require -- hypothesize a remarkable leap of faith on the part of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.042" offset="14605646">It also would require the most extravagant and speculative reading of title IX, to understand it to not only to include private rights of action but to preclude the assertion of express rights of action created by Congress by language in another statute.</text>
