            <text syncTime="1804.291" offset="7323606">That's because immigration is subject to the plenary control of Congress, and when Congress writes a rule and this Court converts it into a standard, it's shifting control over the immigration laws from Congress to the Executive and ultimately to the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.718" offset="7489327">Persecution is not typically a grassroots phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.522" offset="7516494">It's a -- it's a phenomenon typically ordered by governments or rebel groups aspiring to be governments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3578.249" offset="14419404">We think this is very relevant in deciding that question, because the underlying treaty that was implemented specifically referred to crimes, and crimes generally have that -- that -- crimes don't -- a criminal liability doesn't apply to someone who acts if they are coerced.</text>
