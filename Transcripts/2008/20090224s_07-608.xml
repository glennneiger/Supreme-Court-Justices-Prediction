            <text syncTime="7.669" offset="137112">Federal law has long prohibited the possession of firearms by a convicted felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.844" offset="165846">In 1996, Congress extended this ban to persons convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.689" offset="209209">The definition of that phrase is the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.404" offset="228018">Does it cover a misdemeanor battery whenever the battered victim was in fact the offender's current or former spouse or other statutorily defined domestic relation notably the offender's child?</text>
            <text syncTime="48.391" offset="300011">Or is the gun possession ban triggered only when the predicate misdemeanor identifies as an expressed element of the crime, a domestic relationship between the aggressor and the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.504" offset="360511">We hold that the domestic relationship while that must be established beyond a reasonable doubt need not be a defining element of the predicate events.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.280" offset="411606">Respondent Randy Hayes was charged with three counts of possessing firearms after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.490" offset="460403">The indictment identified Hayes' predicate events as a 1994 conviction for battery in violation of West Virginia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.854" offset="509827">The victim of that battery was Hayes' then wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.437" offset="528217">Hayes sought to dismiss the indictment observing that his West Virginia statute of conviction was a generic battery proscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.781" offset="569595">The firearm ban he asserted applied only to persons convicted of an offense that includes a domestic relationship between the offender and the victim as a defining element.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.919" offset="630094">The District Court rejected Hayes' argument, and Hayes entered a conditional guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.966" offset="658307">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed with Hayes and reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.690" offset="689236">In so holding, the Court split from the nine other Courts of Appeals that have decided the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.842" offset="725807">We reverse the Fourth Circuit's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.060" offset="742734">We first explain why the text and context of the governing statute support our reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.679" offset="773141">We next take account of practical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.746" offset="789441">Felon-in-possession laws, Congress recognized, were failing to keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers who are often charged with misdemeanors rather than felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.301" offset="843672">To close this loophole, Congress extended the federal firearm prohibition to misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.112" offset="882855">Excluding from the statutory definition, domestic abusers convicted under generic battery laws would frustrate Congress' manifest purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.848" offset="925800">As of 1996, only about a third of the states had criminal statutes that specifically proscribe domestic violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.182" offset="967178">Even today, the number is only modestly higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.083" offset="986823">If the Fourth Circuit were right in its analysis of the controlling legislation, Congress' enactment would have been a dead letter in the majorly of states from the very moment of its passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.596" offset="1040844">We decline to treat the congressional endeavor as in large measure ineffectual.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.327" offset="1067802">What little there is of legislative history corroborates our ruling, it indicates that Congress sought to apply the firearm ban to all persons convicted of domestic violence offenses whether or not the statutes of conviction happened to contain a domestic relations element.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.350" offset="1147841">Justice Thomas joins all but Part III of the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.001" offset="1166440">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
