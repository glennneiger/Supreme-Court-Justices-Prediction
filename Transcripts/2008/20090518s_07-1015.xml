            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in case 07-1015, Ashcroft versus Iqbal.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.612" offset="137927">This case requires as to determine if a complaint is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.601" offset="165825">The respondent here, Javaid Iqbal, was the plaintiff in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.613" offset="185887">The respondent is a Pakistani and a Muslim.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.198" offset="200307">Following the September 11 terrorists attack, respondent was arrested on criminal charges and detained by federal officials in a maximum security facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.618" offset="237923">After pleading guilty to the charges against him and serving a term of imprisonment, the respondent filed a Bivens action against numerous federal officials including the two petitioners here, John Ashcroft, the former Attorney General, and Robert Mueller, the Director of the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.298" offset="300617">The complaint made various allegations that our opinion discusses in considerable details, but the thrust of the complaint is that petitioners subjected respondent to harsh conditions of confinement on a count of race, religion or national origin in violation of the Fifth and First Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.988" offset="375432">The complaint alleges that Ashcroft was the principal architect of the unconstitutional scheme while Mueller was instrumental in its adoption and execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.512" offset="417541">The petitioners invoked their qualified immunity as government officials and moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.137" offset="455993">The District Court denied the motion interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.478" offset="469368">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.202" offset="480235">Its opinion considered our recent decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. versus Twombly.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.070" offset="507716">It concluded that Twombly creates a flexible plausibility standard that did not require the respondent to amplify his allegations given the facts he did allege in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.804" offset="550661">We grated certiorari, we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.828" offset="562782">Before addressing the merits of petitioners' appeal, we first hold that the Court of Appeals had subject matter jurisdiction to review the District Court's order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.692" offset="606250">There was no final judgment in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.518" offset="617535">But for the reason stated in the opinion, we hold that the Court of Appeals and this Court have jurisdiction to review the trial court's ruling under the collateral order doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.861" offset="658913">Turning to the merits, we hold that respondent's complaint fails to plead sufficient acts to state a claim for unlawful discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.163" offset="692140">In Twombly, we considered the elements of plaintiff must plead to maintain an anti-trust action and this case requires us to determine the facts of plaintiff must show in a Bivens action.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.748" offset="758491">As the respondent correctly concedes there is no vicarious or imputed liability in the Bivens or a 1983 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.434" offset="789211">That simply means that each individual defendant's liability stand or falls based on the defendant's own conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.761" offset="814498">The supervisor can be held to account for his or her own misconduct, but as it is conceded that there is no vicarious liability here, the supervisor cannot be held liable for a subordinate's tortious behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.140" offset="864026">The term supervisory liability and a context of a Bivens or 1983 action is a misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.014" offset="887536">The elements necessary to demonstrate a constitutional violation will vary with the constitutional provision at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.018" offset="911569">But where a plaintiff is alleging discrimination in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments are precedents established that purposeful discrimination is required to impose liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.593" offset="953887">To survive a motion to dismiss, respondent's complaint must show the petitioners' purposefully discriminated against him on the basis of race, religion or national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.588" offset="993802">Respondent's complaint comes up short.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.207" offset="1004251">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, a complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.Respondent's pleading does not comply with Rule 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.449" offset="1057228">Allegation is based on the bold assertion that petitioners agreed to subject to respondent to harsh conditions solely on account of impermissible factors are mere legal conclusions that are not entitled to be assumed true.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.268" offset="1108532">Though his complaint does contain the well pleaded factual allegation that petitioners arrested thousands of Arab Muslim men in the wake of 9/11, except in that fact is true does not give rise to a plausible entitlement to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.137" offset="1160046">It is not at all surprising that a legitimate constitutional policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected links to the attacks would produce a disparate impact on Arab Muslims even though petitioners' purpose was not to target Arabs or Muslims.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.150" offset="1236114">Now, it is important to note that we express no opinion concerning a sufficiency of respondent's complaint against the defendants who are not before us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.787" offset="1270596">Respondent's account of his prison ordeal alleges serious official misconduct that we need not addressed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.183" offset="1296196">Our decision is limited to the determination that respondent's complaint does not entitle him to relief from these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.164" offset="1324095">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.257" offset="1336529">The case is remanded to determine if respondent should be give leave to amend his deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.000" offset="1359517">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer have joined and Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
