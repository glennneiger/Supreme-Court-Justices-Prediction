            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The second case I have to announce is 08-88, Vermont against Brillon.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.033" offset="133580">This case concerns the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy a right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.897" offset="177048">Michael Brillon, defendant below, respondent here, was arrested in July 2001 on felony domestic assault and habitual offender charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.330" offset="226785">Nearly three years later, in June 2004, he was tried by a jury, found guilty as charged, and sentenced to 12 to 20 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.992" offset="269416">The Vermont Supreme Court vacated Brillon's conviction and held that the charges against him must be dismissed because he had been denied his right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.819" offset="316646">During the time between Brillon's arrest and his trial, at least six different attorneys were appointed to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.330" offset="350710">Brillon fired the first, who served from July 2001 to February 2002.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.810" offset="376623">His third lawyer, who served from March 2002 until June 2002, was allowed to withdraw when he reported that Brillon had threatened his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.747" offset="428450">The Vermont Supreme Court charged against Brillon the delays associated with those periods, but charged against the State periods in which assigned counsel failed to move the case forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.117" offset="481844">We hold that the Vermont Supreme Court erred in ranking assigned counsel essentially as state actors in the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.184" offset="526148">Assigned counsel, just as retained counsel, act on behalf of their clients, and delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.014" offset="581528">For a total of some six months of the time that elapsed between Brillon's arrest and his trial, Brillon lacked an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.586" offset="615800">The State may be charged with those months if the gaps resulted from the trial court's failure to appoint replacement counsel with dispatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.389" offset="654984">Similarly, the State may bear responsibility if there is a breakdown in the public defender system.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.902" offset="681002">But, as the Vermont Supreme Court acknowledged, the record does not establish any such institutional breakdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.293" offset="714543">For these reasons detailed further in our opinion, we hold that the record in this case does not show that Brillon was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.427" offset="763131">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens joins.</text>
