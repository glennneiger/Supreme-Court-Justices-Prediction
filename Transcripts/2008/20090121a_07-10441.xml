            <text syncTime="9.022" offset="141521">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: FBI agents delayed presenting Mr. Corley to a Federal magistrate judge in order to obtain his two confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.413" offset="191049">The admissibility of these two confessions depends on an issue of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.381" offset="210902">It's the interpretation of 3501(c), together with the McNabb-Mallory rule and the right of prompt presentment.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.721" offset="240264">Now, there's two critical issues I would like to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.839" offset="252803">The first is that 3501(c), as it's written by Congress, leaves the McNabb-Mallory rule in place outside the 6-hour time limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.779" offset="292509">And the second is that the government's interpretation, under which 3501(c) is merely a voluntariness safe harbor, is unfaithful to the text and the structure of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.087" offset="345799">Turning to the first point, subsection (c) modifies McNabb-Mallory, but does not eliminate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.025" offset="377563">The exact text of the statute here is crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.477" offset="391356">And for the Court's convenience, on page 7 of the yellow brief, the operative language of the -- of the text of the statute is set out.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.874" offset="476933">And they were both pre -- Miranda decisions, when now the defendant is told of his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.699" offset="520192">Whatever Congress put in 1301 -- 3501, this Court could say, well, McNabb-Mallory are no longer viable cases in light of Miranda.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.427" offset="599082">This Court could, but for several prudential reasons, this Court should not overturn McNabb and Mallory and should not find them to be no longer valid considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.318" offset="646729">First of all -- or no longer valid precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.451" offset="655193">First of all, the Solicitor General's Office has not asked that McNabb and Mallory be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.655" offset="676091">Second of all, the parties haven't briefed that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.757" offset="688421">It's been briefed instead as a statutory interpretation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.626" offset="699914">Thirdly, Congress through 3501(c) structured the statute on the existing precedent of McNabb and Mallory, and at this point, for the Court to pull McNabb and Mallory out from underneath that structure, it would cause that structure to basically collapse.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.104" offset="769818">It depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.970" offset="773266">The 6-hour time limitation depends on the existence of McNabb-Mallory outside that 6-hour time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.457" offset="799284">Congress can revisit this issue at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.326" offset="814749">Their hands are not tied.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.028" offset="821541">Congress could choose to change 3501(c) so that it no longer provides for McNabb-Mallory outside the 6-hour time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.432" offset="855186">But that's a decision for Congress, and this Court, I would suggest respectfully, should respect the -- the prerogatives and the -- the policy choice that Congress has already made.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.826" offset="920701">I -- I'm arguing that the exact language, whether it is "codification" or "leaves intact", doesn't matter.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="212.799" offset="956646">Well, there's a very big difference, isn't there, between saying we're codifying this rule, we're making it a statutory requirement, and saying, assuming that this supervisory rule that was adopted by the Supreme Court remains in place, we're creating an exception to it?</text>
            <text syncTime="227.342" offset="1014742">Which of those two things does -- does subsection (c) do?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_l_mccolgin" startTime="230.294" stopTime="257.860">
            <label>Mr. David L. McColgin</label>
            <text syncTime="230.294" offset="1026550">--Your Honor, it does the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.377" offset="1034909">It leaves McNabb-Mallory in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.412" offset="1043059">However, the language of the statute uses the phrase "time limitation" in the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.149" offset="1066047">"Time limitation" implies more than we're just not just touching McNabb-Mallory for the time being.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.386" offset="1086945">It depends -- the statute depends on McNabb-Mallory to create the time limitation, because without McNabb-Mallory there is no limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.956" offset="1121217">After the 6 hours, nothing else happens unless McNabb-Mallory--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="257.860" offset="1136891">Well, it would be consistent with the second purpose that you gave to say that there's a 6-hour safe harbor or whatever term you want to call it, and beyond 6 hours, the Court is free to reexamine its supervisory rule in light of what Congress has provided in (a) and (b) of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.225" offset="1230305">--Well, but again, the language of the statute is "time limitation".</text>
            <text syncTime="285.094" offset="1245769">That's strong language for Congress to use, and it indicates that Congress intended to limit the taking of confessions to those first 6 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.950" offset="1281191">There is no limitation without McNabb-Mallory in effect.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="297.819" offset="1296656">It is a little bit odd to say that Congress has built a statute around a supervisory rule, but taken away the authority of this Court to reexamine the supervisory rule.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_l_mccolgin" startTime="307.175" stopTime="353.906">
            <label>Mr. David L. McColgin</label>
            <text syncTime="307.175" offset="1334168">I'm not actually saying that Congress has taken away the authority of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.162" offset="1350050">I'm saying as a prudential manner, since Congress can address this on its own and since it structured the statute on the foundation of McNabb-Mallory, it would be best for this Court to leave up to Congress that policy choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.636" offset="1399996">Congress chose in 1968 to leave the McNabb -- Mallory protection against presentment delay in place after 6 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.492" offset="1431343">It was a compromise, and it was an appropriate compromise, because what it did was it cut out the first 6 hours during which there had been the most problems with the application of McNabb-Mallory.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.864" offset="1472825">The 6-hour time limitation effectively lowers the social costs of this -- of this rule of this rule of inadmissibility while maintaining the deterrent effect of McNabb-Mallory outside the 6 hours.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="353.906" stopTime="357.774">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="353.906" offset="1520995">Well, you were trying to get to page 7 of your yellow brief?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_l_mccolgin" startTime="357.774" stopTime="410.207">
            <label>Mr. David L. McColgin</label>
            <text syncTime="357.774" offset="1536564">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.691" offset="1540221">On page 7, I've set out the operative language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.845" offset="1560806">And what the statute actually provides is that a confession shall not be inadmissible solely because of delay if such confession is found by the trial judge to have been made voluntarily and made within 6 hours of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.604" offset="1619843">Now, the phrase "inadmissible solely because of delay" is clearly a reference to the McNabb-Mallory rule because that's exactly what McNabb-Mallory does.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.793" offset="1656623">It renders the confession inadmissible solely because of delay if the delay in presentment was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.447" offset="1683163">So what the statute is providing on its face is that a confession shall not be subject to the McNabb -- Mallory rule if it's voluntarily given and made within 6 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.736" offset="1724332">The 6-hour provision means that McNabb-Mallory is, in effect, outside of the 6 hours.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="410.207" offset="1746275">Or it may just mean that the confessions beyond 6 hours may be excluded solely because of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.878" offset="1772920">In other words, if a judge says, look, I don't want to hear about all this other stuff, it's just too long, he can -- he can't do that beyond the 6 hours, but he can within the 6 hours.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.935" offset="1817119">Within the 6 hours, he cannot exclude solely because of delay, even a voluntary statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.322" offset="1838749">That is the McNabb-Mallory principle, inadmissible solely because of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.774" offset="1856512">So what it's saying is that McNabb-Mallory does not apply within the 6 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.642" offset="1871976">Now, the government's interpretation is that this is simply a voluntariness safe harbor, and what they do is they read the word "inadmissible" as being synonymous with the word "involuntary".</text>
            <text syncTime="451.848" offset="1912832">But the text of the statute shows that those two terms are not synonymous, because the text of the statute says that in order for a confession to be admissible it must be voluntary and made within 6 hours.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.934" offset="2025159">So really, you know, if you live by the text, you die by the text.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.860" offset="2084822">Instead, we just applied the principle that a general provision -- if it conflicts with a specific provision, the specific controls over the general.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.049" offset="2121603">What we have in subsection (a) is a general statement that voluntary statements are admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.017" offset="2141456">But if we read that the way the government does, as making admissible every voluntary statement, then that would make subsection (c) completely superfluous.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.496" offset="2211359">It simply establishes a -- an exception in the area of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.783" offset="2228600">And this is the way statutes work.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.317" offset="2234661">When there is a conflict between a general provision and a specific one, the specific must control over the general.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.287" offset="2258589">If it worked the other way around, it would render the specific superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.973" offset="2273322">So this has happened in -- in statutes in numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.126" offset="2289936">In 1983 versus 2254, it was held that 2254 as a specific provision controls over 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.715" offset="6332332">Both of those cases considered a pre-Miranda regime in which there was no constitutional law that required that a suspect be advised of his rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.901" offset="6453018">This Court in McNabb and Mallory thus fashioned a judicial rule of evidence, an exclusionary rule, under the Court's supervisory power not as an effectuation of something that Congress specifically intended but of its own force as a way to backstop the rule 5 requirement.</text>
