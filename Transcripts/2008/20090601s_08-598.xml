            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Ginsburg has the opinion of the Court this morning in case 08-598, Bobby verus Bies.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.030" offset="146516">In Atkins v. Virginia, decided in 2002, this Court held that the Eighth Amendment bars execution of mentally retarded offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.510" offset="200432">Under our pre-Atkins precedent, mental retardation, narrative consideration as a mitigating factor but did not bar in position of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.983" offset="254349">Nearly, a decade before Atkins, respondent Michael Bies was tried and convicted in Ohio of the aggravated murder, kidnapping and attempted rape of a 10-year-old boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.014" offset="310460">At the sentencing stage, the trial judge instructed the jury to weigh mitigating circumstances including evidence of Bies' mile to borderline mental retardation against aggravating circumstances including the crime's brutality.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.332" offset="387783">The jury recommended a death sentence which the trial court imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.817" offset="409725">Ohio's Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court affirmed, each concluding that Bies' mental retardation was entitled to someway in litigation, but that the aggravators outweighed the mitigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.909" offset="474091">After this Court decided Atkins, Bies sought state post conviction relief and the Court ordered a full hearing on Bies' mental capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.236" offset="523410">Rather than proceeding with that hearing, Bies filed a federal habeas petition in U.S. District Court, contending that the Fifth Amendments' Double Jeopardy Clause barred the State from re-litigating the issue of his mental retardation.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.849" offset="585791">The District Court granted the habeas petition and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.571" offset="612749">The Sixth Circuit identified as the controlling precedent this Court's decision in Ashe v. Swenson.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.093" offset="642842">We held in Ashe that the doctrine of issue preclusion is a component of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.079" offset="670741">Issue preclusion was dispositive of Bies' case as Sixth Circuit believed of critical importance to its decision, the Sixth Circuit found necessary to the death penalty sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.389" offset="719956">The Ohio Court's recognition that Bies is qualified as mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.096" offset="746809">We reverse and note first that Bies was not twice put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.887" offset="773977">He was convicted and sentenced to death and Ohio sought no further prosecution or punishment rather, rather than successive efforts to prosecute or punish him, this case involves successive efforts by Bies to overturn his capital sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.091" offset="854852">The doctrine of issue preclusion on which the Sixth Circuit relied, bars litigation of issues actually determined and necessary to the ultimate outcome of a prior proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.931" offset="914202">The Federal Court of Appeals held that all requirements with issue preclusion were met in Bies' case.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.674" offset="941160">That holding was in correct because mental retardation was not a conclusive or necessary determination in any Ohio court proceeding to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.305" offset="987658">The determination ranks as necessary, only when the final outcome hinges on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.634" offset="1012945">Statements made by the Ohio Courts regarding Bies' mental capacity, plainly worth not necessary to the final outcome that is the judgment affirming his death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.197" offset="1067280">Further, even if court issue preclusion requirements had been met, an exemption to the doctrine's application would be warranted due to the intervening Atkins decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.599" offset="1116808">That change in law substantially alters the State's incentive to contest Bies' mental capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.603" offset="1152857">Under Atkins, mental retardation bars a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.981" offset="1170411">When Bies was tried however, retardation was only a mitigator, moreover of retardation play, pre-Atkins could backfire.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.567" offset="1216700">The prosecutor could seize an evidence of the defendant's diminished capacity to urge the defendant's dangerousness to others, rendering death, not like the appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.415" offset="1264138">In short, the question whether Bies qualifies under Atkins as a mentally retarded person, ineligible for the death penalty is now right for a foreign fair determination in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.115" offset="1318891">Our decision corrects the Federal Court's errors in temporarily derailing that determination, the opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
