            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1529, Montejo v. Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.170" offset="139097">Mr. Verrilli.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.939" offset="142232">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether Petitioner Montejo should be denied the Sixth Amendment protections of Michigan v. Jackson because he silently acquiesced in the appointment of counsel at his initial hearing, rather than affirmatively accepting the appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.667" offset="221121">The Louisiana Supreme Court believed that an affirmative acceptance was required to trigger Jackson and therefore upheld the admission of a confession elicited during police-initiated interrogation after Montejo's Sixth Amendment right had attached and after a lawyer had been appointed to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.481" offset="304400">If Jackson applies, that confession should not have been admitted, and Jackson should apply because nothing in this Court's precedents or, frankly, in common sense supports a rule that affords less Sixth Amendment protection to defendants who are automatically appointed counsel at initial hearings than to defendants who are appointed counsel after a request for counsel has--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="75.814" offset="409725">I thought that the rationale of Jackson was that the confession is simply deemed to be coerced if the defendant has expressed -- has expressed -- his desire to have counsel present or even to be represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.347" offset="503871">It isn't clear that, which is already a stretch, to assume that simply because I said, you know, I would like to have counsel, if the police continue to say, well, come on, won't you talk to us -- it's already a stretch to say it's automatically coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.872" offset="573983">But now you're saying, even if the defendant has never expressed even a desire to be represented by counsel but has simply had counsel appointed, in fact even if he doesn't know about the appointment of counsel, the -- his confession is automatically deemed to be coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.186" offset="655172">That seems to me quite, even more extravagant than Jackson.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.295" offset="711596">In a situation like Jackson, the defendant requested counsel and that was deemed to be an election of the right to rely on counsel, not merely at the initial hearing but for all purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.736" offset="1297366">It goes through each State, and what it shows is that approximately half the States have procedures in which, as a matter of course, the defendant is asked at the hearing whether he or she wants counsel, and if the defendant says yes, then we're in a Jackson situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.077" offset="1862760">The Court held that, in the Fifth Amendment context, because the Sixth Amendment right had not attached, that the Miranda warnings sufficed to guarantee the reliability of the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.765" offset="1901526">But the Court was very quick to point out, and then reiterated this again in Patterson, that in the Sixth Amendment context that would be a violation because it's an interference with the relationship between the defendant and his lawyer, and the ability of the defendant to rely on the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.442" offset="1960249">And that's the key.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.300" offset="2523658">But you really get to the same place by holding, as we submit the Court really should hold, that when -- when you have an automatic appointment, unless there is some reason to think the defendant is rejecting it, that Jackson kicks in and that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.959" offset="5254290">Does Jackson support the notion that he simply has a right to rely upon counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.447" offset="5280204">I think that is your principal argument here because that would be the argument that supports your claim that there shouldn't be a distinction between a case in which the State simply appoints counsel without being asked and a case in which he actually asks for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.908" offset="5354078">That would be a nice way of rationalizing that distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.840" offset="6173800">Well, I think two -- two points on that, Mr. Chief Justice: First, I think it would actually break new ground for this Court to hold that the defendant who has a lawyer isn't entitled to the protection of Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.747" offset="6217477">This Court has never held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.214" offset="6223329">And every time it has addressed the issue, it said the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.699" offset="6233255">Admittedly in dictum, but in Patterson and Moran it said the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.401" offset="6244018">So that is what is really breaking new ground, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.003" offset="6254467">And second, the only way to treat these two categories of people differently is to come up with a principled distinction for why the right should apply differently to one than the other, and I submit that none has been offered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.922" offset="14138117">In fact, the very passage in Montoya to which Respondent's counsel adverts -- it says there doesn't have to be a request so long as there is an assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.842" offset="14169778">And that's the principle they're advocating.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3549.811" offset="14305719">--Well, if it's introduced in the case in chief, it's substantive evidence on which the prosecution relied or can rely to establish the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.365" offset="14331946">It's very much like Fulminante in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.167" offset="14343126">There were two confessions, one admissible, the other inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.536" offset="14356605">And it was the self-reinforcing character of the two that made it not a harmless error for Fulminante.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.340" offset="14375832">We really have the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.690" offset="14381160">But, if I could, I would like to get back, Justice Kennedy, to the Moran case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.658" offset="14401118">I do think, with all due respect, there was an element of deception in Moran that was sanctioned as consistent with Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.581" offset="14432778">Two things happened there: The police informed Moran's lawyer that they -- incorrectly, falsely -- that they weren't going to interrogate him, but they also failed to inform Moran that he had a lawyer, and the lawyer was standing out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.340" offset="14487845">And that's fully as much of a deception as telling somebody he doesn't have a lawyer when he does, or withholding information that made a big difference for Sixth Amendment purposes, which is why the Court in Moran drew that line very sharply and said, for Fifth Amendment purposes, the Sixth Amendment right hasn't attached, there isn't an interference with the attorney-client relationship, but the very same thing would be forbidden under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.337" offset="14575825">And Patterson says exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.539" offset="14584602">In Patterson, again -- just to conclude, Justice Breyer -- drew the line exactly where Your Honor's hypothetical drew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.110" offset="14606858">What Patterson says is that, if a defendant does not have a lawyer, we operate one way; when a defendant has a lawyer, a different set of rules kick in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.084" offset="14654819">And then, it says, indeed the different rules kick in even if a defendant requests a lawyer, making clear that the point of extending to request was to put defendants who have asked for lawyers but don't have them yet in the same position as defendants who have lawyers, not to give them a superior Sixth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.712" offset="14729320">Thank you.</text>
