            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">We will hear argument first today in Case 07-588, Entergy Corporation v. Riverkeeper Incorporated, and the consolidated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.433" offset="142169">Mr. Joseffer.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daryl_joseffer" startTime="10.900" stopTime="96.268">
            <label>Mr. Daryl Joseffer</label>
            <text syncTime="10.900" offset="148020">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For more than 30 years, EPA has construed the Clean Water Act to permit it to consider the relationship between costs and benefits in setting limits on water intake.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.800" offset="195563">The court of appeals' unprecedented limitation of that discretion is wrong as a matter of basic Chevron interpretive principles for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.001" offset="228373">First, the controlling statutory standard, which looks to the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts, is ambiguous and does not preclude EPA's interpretation, especially in light of the statute's other "best technology" provisions, two of which expressly require consideration of the relationship between costs and benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.524" offset="302456">Second, there is no indication that Congress determined for itself that the benefits of stricter regulations would in fact outweigh their costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.725" offset="335266">Instead, from both the context -- I'm sorry, for -- I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.504" offset="358463">There is no indication in either the context or the history of the statute that Congress determined for itself that the benefits of stricter regulations would in fact justify their costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.907" offset="400050">Instead the indication is that Congress left that to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.809" offset="411648">Congress took a very careful look at the separate issue of the discharge of pollutants and legislated numerous very specific provisions concerning the discharge of pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.787" offset="455534">But when it came to water intake, Congress gave scant attention to that at all and included only this one very general provision in the act on that subject.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="96.268" stopTime="103.610">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="96.268" offset="489493">Of course, in the other provision, it specifically required consideration of costs and benefits and it didn't do so in this provision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daryl_joseffer" startTime="103.610" stopTime="127.163">
            <label>Mr. Daryl Joseffer</label>
            <text syncTime="103.610" offset="518855">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.437" offset="522094">In our view, that strongly supports our view that, first, Congress understood that consideration of cost and benefits was not incompatible with the application of a best technology standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.340" offset="565770">Otherwise it would not have required that consideration as part of the best quality standard, which seems to show at a minimum that a best technology standard does not unambiguously foreclose consideration of the relationship between costs and benefits.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="127.163" stopTime="238.865">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="127.163" offset="613000">May I ask you to follow up on that, because your statement about compatibility raises what for me is a fundamental difficulty in understanding this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.235" offset="657304">And I think my difficulty goes both to Chevron step one and step two.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.172" offset="673081">And that is this: I think we all start from the premise that, whatever else subsection (b) had in mind, it was imposing some kind of a technology-driven standard criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.901" offset="732014">It's there in the words.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.651" offset="742985">The difficulty that I have is if you are going to apply on at least a site-specific basis a cost-benefit analysis, I'm not sure how it would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.391" offset="809963">In other words, it seems to me that when you're talking about the -- the possible harm from pulling in a few fish or a few plankton or a few baby clam larvae and so on, as against the cost conceivably of millions of dollars for extending intake pipes or putting technical -- expensive filtering mechanisms, you are dealing with such incommensurables that I don't know how on a site specific basis you would sensibly apply a cost-benefit analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.503" offset="958443">Are a thousand plankton worth a million dollars?</text>
            <text syncTime="216.705" offset="971191">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.843" offset="975788">And my difficulty then is, I don't know how it would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.233" offset="993343">And because I don't know how it would work, it seems to me that if you are going to apply a cost-benefit analysis, the odds are what you are going to do is basically eliminate the whole technology-driven point of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.463" offset="1050290">So that's my difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.695" offset="1055201">Can you help me out on that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daryl Joseffer</label>
            <text syncTime="238.865" offset="1059903">Two points on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.381" offset="1065963">The first is that this is how it's always been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.991" offset="1076412">I mean, since 1977 at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.225" offset="1085294">First, permitting decisions have always been done on a facility-by-facility, case-by-case basis.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="250.922" stopTime="294.016">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="250.922" offset="1108072">Do we know so far as intake pipes are concerned?</text>
            <text syncTime="253.188" offset="1117163">I mean, maybe I am being foolish in thinking it's a little easy to make sense of it when we're talking about toxic discharges, but leaving that aside, do we know that, with respect to these kind of intake technology decisions, that the cost-benefit analysis has been in any way sensible?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.571" offset="1206711">In other words, maybe what Congress had in mind was this just doesn't work doing it on a site-specific cost-benefit analysis, and that's why we're going to pass subsection (b) in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.440" offset="1258120">So you say, well, we've had experience with cost-benefit analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.300" offset="1273584">What's the experience?</text>

            <text syncTime="294.406" offset="1282048">I guess now I have three points.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daryl Joseffer</label>
            <text syncTime="296.859" offset="1291870">The first is that -- the first is that the history here is, that I was referring to, is with respect to cooling water intake structures, where for more than 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.386" offset="1329904">Cooling water intake structures have been determined on a case-by-case basis, where EPA determined as early as 1977 and ever since that it would be unreasonable to impose -- to require the use of technology whose costs were wholly disproportionate to its benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.425" offset="1390090">So this is--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="322.065" offset="1392703">And have these been applications of something more than the outside standard, which I guess everybody agrees would apply in a case like this, that when it just becomes wholly or outrageously disproportionate, there wouldn't be -- that there would in that sense be a cost-benefit cutoff?</text>
            <text syncTime="338.026" offset="1456546">These have been more subtle decisions than that?</text>

            <text syncTime="340.838" offset="1467726">And I mean, just the phrasing of the standard, whether costs are wholly disproportionate to benefits, itself indicates that there is a comparison here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daryl Joseffer</label>
            <text syncTime="348.649" offset="1498969">And we cite in our brief one particular -- in our reply brief, one specific example where benefits were clearly not de minimis.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="354.381" stopTime="393.490">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="354.381" offset="1521957">The Second Circuit recognized that latter kind of taking account of costs disproportionate, more than the industry would bear, and they also recognized a cost comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.720" offset="1575246">If you have a cheaper method that is almost as good, you can use that and you don't have to use the one that will capture the extra fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.183" offset="1617147">So everybody agrees that there is some consideration of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.043" offset="1636582">The question is how much, and the concern is, as Justice Souter said, that you are comparing things that aren't comparable.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.222" offset="1701261">I guess one basic point is just that this -- first off -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.253" offset="1717457">In terms of the court of appeals' recognition that costs and benefits could be compared in extreme circumstances, that just deprives it of the logic of its position, because when we talk about the extent or degree or manner to which a permissible consideration can be considered, that's a classic matter for the agency's gap-filling discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.856" offset="1779837">It's not something for the court of appeals or the Respondents to get discretion on.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.869" offset="1791854">And, second, in terms of the concern that cost-benefit analysis can be difficult because we're comparing benefits that are not easily monetized to economic costs, that is just systematically the case with all cost-benefit analyses, even ones which people do in ordinary life.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.895" offset="1851935">When I decide whether to buy a TV for this amount or a more expensive TV for a different amount, I don't know exactly how in my head I quantify that, but I do.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.587" offset="1966770">But my question and I think Justice Ginsburg's question is, does it make any sense in these circumstances to think that you really can do a cost-benefit analysis?</text>
            <text syncTime="475.988" offset="2008357">And if the answer is no -- we have been purporting to do it but it really doesn't make a lot of sense -- then it either means that there is just going to be an irrational process going on, or it means that the technology-driven standard basically is going to be read right out of the statute, because you are always going to find some disproportion which is -- which is going to limit your use of technology.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.034" offset="6020556">But on a national basis, at 355a, the agency said that they understood that reducing impingement and entrainment at the ranges they were talking about would not be justified in many locations across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.485" offset="6070293">And that's because power plants may be impinging numbers of fish that aren't actually harming that water body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.232" offset="6097356">Fish have the potential to procreate in very substantial numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.056" offset="6116582">Some fish spawn 500,000 eggs in a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.354" offset="6853862">It's because we don't think that those kinds of absurd circumstances result from the cost-benefit balance mandated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.458" offset="6878208">Let me explain why, because there are three safeguards in the statutory language, its plain meaning, which would guard against any possibility that a regulated facility would have to spend millions or hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to protect just a few fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.261" offset="6937454">They would -- that would never happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.194" offset="13449153">What -- the way Congress originally approached hazardous water pollutants and toxic air pollutants, the Clean Air Act, was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.145" offset="13481023">They said EPA, this is so harmful that we actually want you to do an assessment to figure out at what level will it no longer be harmful to humans?</text>

            <text syncTime="3360.904" offset="13548001">And so, they had -- the regulation depended on this incredible information, and the result was that EPA did nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.121" offset="13572869">They did nothing for water toxics, they did nothing for air toxics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.211" offset="13589274">So in 1977, when they learned how more information basically could lead to less regulation, they said all right: We've got to change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.304" offset="13617591">That doesn't work, so we are going to move to a technology-based performance approach in the first instance, and then couple it with -- still keeping the health base as a backup, to be able to go past that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.079" offset="13660745">So they put the technology base as a first step and they kept the 307, but in 1972, Your Honor, there was only one provision of the Clean Water Act in which Congress delegated any authority to EPA to compare costs and benefits; and that was under 301(b)(2) and 304(b)(2).</text>

            <text syncTime="3539.658" offset="14263024">The fact that there's no list of factors here, and instead just one general sentence, just underscores that on this issue, Congress was delegating especially broad authority to the agency to address a problem that at the time was relatively novel and that legislative record confirms Congress itself did not give any real weight to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.167" offset="14325091">If we want to look at the floor statements, though, I would not look to the floor statement of Congressman Muskie concerning a different standard, which was the BAT standard, but instead to the only floor statement that addresses this standard, and it says that economic practicability is the test, and everyone agrees that practicably considers costs and benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3628.014" offset="14616409">EPA did two things: First, as you mentioned, first it created nationwide performance standards; second, it did a variance when an individual facility's costs are significantly greater than the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.728" offset="14663325">So, first, in determining -- so -- well, the second of those is easy because there is an obvious thumb on the environmental side of the scales there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3657.923" offset="14736050">Instead it weighed up a number of considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.578" offset="14746708">It looked to the incremental benefits of closed-cycle cooling versus the technologies that it chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.109" offset="14764784">And then it -- and then it determined that those incremental benefits were outweighed by a variety of other things, including, one, the extremely high costs of closed-cycle cooling, three and a half billion; second, the cost-benefit ratio, which was extremely disproportionate; third, the energy impacts which, as you mentioned, are really quite significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.383" offset="14837927">We are talking about 40 percent of the Nation's power supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.303" offset="14849630">And if we are going to reduce that by 4 percent and require 20 new plants to be built and require each of those plants to be taken offline for 10 months while it's retrofitted, that's really a very significant concern of EPA's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.845" offset="14887769">And then the fourth is air pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.331" offset="14893725">And so when EPA is weighing benefits against all of those other things and is not purporting to assign artificial monetary values to everything, I argue that that just underscores that we are well within the agency's discretion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.542" offset="14938551">If I could also turn then to just the main point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.074" offset="14964673">One of the main points here is that I really don't think Respondents have any logic to their position, because when we are talking about the text they say costs have to be considered against affordability and not against benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.288" offset="15005529">But when we are talking about absurd results, they say, oh sure, you can consider costs against benefits, when it would otherwise be absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.393" offset="15029979">But under Chevron it's the agency's gap-filling discretion to decide where to draw that line, and nothing draws a de minimis line in the statute any more than the line EPA has drawn.</text>
