            <text syncTime="7.823" offset="137738">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Crawford v. Washington, this Court made clear that the right to confrontation, at its core, is a protection against a system of trial by affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.318" offset="187685">It is an ancient procedural guarantee that requires the prosecution to prove its case through live witnesses who testify before the jury and who are subject to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.237" offset="227391">Introducing forensic laboratory reports, such as the certificates at issue in this case, is the modern equivalent of trial by affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.453" offset="260305">The documents are sworn formal statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.421" offset="272112">They are crafted purposefully for the express purpose of proving a fact that is an element of a criminal offense, and, as the State forthrightly admits in its brief, they are introduced in lieu of having the analyst called as a witness to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.460" offset="328328">They are therefore quintessentially testimonial evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.127" offset="1122973">But to the extent the Commonwealth is taking the position that cross-examining would be fruitless in a situation like this, the very basis of this Court's Crawford decision is that's not for courts to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.687" offset="1173232">It is up to the defense counsel to -- if he wishes, to insist on live testimony that he can cross-examine and then--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="274.213" offset="1203325">Well, then why -- why isn't it an adequate substitute to say that, if the defendant wants this testimony, the defendant can call the analyst and cross-examine the analyst as an adverse witness?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="291.645" stopTime="379.906">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="291.645" offset="1273020">--Well, three reasons, Justice Ginsburg: First, if that were correct, then I don't see anything that would stop the prosecution in every criminal case simply from putting a pile of affidavits on a judge's desk and saying it's up to the defense to call whatever witnesses he wants and cross-examine them.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.372" offset="1339894">But even as a matter of text and structure of the Constitution, as a textual matter, the right to confrontation is a passive right in the defendant's hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.508" offset="1372494">It requires the prosecution to arrange for the confrontation, and that's bolstered structurally by the Compulsory Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.568" offset="1404677">Remember, the Compulsory Process Clause gives the defendant the very right that you just explained, that the defendant can subpoena witnesses into court and ask them questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.379" offset="1443965">And surely the Confrontation Clause adds something on top of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.296" offset="1455668">And I think this Court's decision in Taylor against Illinois is the best explanation of the difference between the two clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.468" offset="1480328">This Court said that the Confrontation Clause arises simply by the nature of adversary proceedings, and it's a -- it's a rule that governs the way the prosecution must introduce its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.163" offset="1527139">As I said at the opening here, it's a requirement that the prosecution put its live witnesses on the stand for the jury to observe them.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.615" offset="1556919">The defense, of course, has the decision whether to cross-examine those witnesses, or if witnesses are not called by the prosecution that he would wish to be part of the case, he can subpoena them.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.456" offset="1600282">But we would vigorously oppose any attempt to shift the burden on the defense to call witnesses like this.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="379.906" offset="1626091">But you would say that what they call the notice-and-demand type statute, that that's all right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="386.277" stopTime="449.033">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="386.277" offset="1651587">There is a variety of notice-and-demand type statutes, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the law professors' brief lays it out the best of what we have before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.353" offset="1683874">We agree with the Solicitor General that a plain notice-and-demand statute that requires the defense to do nothing more than assert his right in advance of trial to have the prosecution put a live witness on the stand would be constitutional, I think, under this Court's jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.626" offset="1748971">Under the Compulsory Process Clause, under the jury right, there are plenty of constitutional rights that, with fair notice, a Defendant can be required to assert in advance of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.640" offset="1788991">Now, there are other types of statutes that other States call "notice and demand" that require something more of the defendant, whether it be that the defendant himself call the witness, whether it be the defendant himself make some kind of good faith or prima facie showing in order to have the prosecution call the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.115" offset="1854924">Those types of statutes, I think this Court, to the extent in this opinion it would mention notice-and-demand statutes, it would want to be careful to leave for another day, because, again, we would agree with the Solicitor General that those would raise more difficult constitutional questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.033" offset="1902571">In your answer, you said, well, there would be this stack of affidavits and that's all the State would have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.780" offset="1925559">I think, Mr. Fisher, that was not quite responsive because the question here is whether or not there is an exception for business records.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.294" offset="1959623">Nobody is talking about affidavits, witnesses, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.667" offset="1969131">We are talking about business records done in the ordinary course.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.058" offset="1978640">It's true that it -- that the core principle is whether that confrontation is required, but the question is whether or not business records should be treated as something that are not testimony because they are done based on other protocols with other procedures where there is substantial insulation from the facts of the particular case because it's a routine scientific exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.655" offset="2089085">So I think your answer, I would agree, is responsive based on your theory of the case, but as a matter of practice and as a matter of the issue that's before the Court, I don't think it addresses it.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.103" offset="2138823">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.711" offset="2141330">I -- I took Justice Ginsburg's question to be asking whether giving the defendant the right to subpoena the witness would be adequate under the Confrontation Clause if these documents were testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.613" offset="2176857">Now, your question is whether they might not be testimonial at all viewed through the lens of whether they are a business record.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.328" offset="2203711">So, as a historical matter, I think it's plain that no documents prepared in contemplation of litigation were ever considered to be business records.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.030" offset="2242581">And this Court's decision in Palmer v. Hoffman in 1943 I think lays that out very, very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.934" offset="2266196">So there is no historical argument that business records would fit -- would be exempted from the testimonial rule as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.085" offset="2298796">And, of course, this Court said in Crawford v. Washington that even if a State under a modern hearsay exception, whether it be a business-record rule or in the State of Massachusetts's case a special, brand-new hearsay rule -- just because that might be okay in the run-of-the-mill cases doesn't exempt it from the right to confrontation.</text>

            <text syncTime="569.703" offset="2385209">Well, I think that is best characterized, with all due respect, as an argument for its reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.509" offset="2408511">And it may well be that judges and juries think that certain scientific processes yield more reliable results in terms of reports and testimony and assertions.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.944" offset="2450202">But we think, again -- and this Court's decision in Crawford says quite strongly -- that a judge cannot decide just on the basis of reliability to exempt a given record or a class of records from the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.940" offset="2506209">And I think, Justice Kennedy, another analogy that makes it even more clear is police reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.047" offset="2526584">Police reports, just like the lab report in this case, are -- are sworn documents created by public servants who are sworn to tell the truth, sworn to find evidence whether it exonerates, whether it incriminates, and to write up a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.181" offset="2591159">And I don't think anyone has ever suggested that police reports describing a crime scene -- for example, no matter how objective the facts relayed, such as there is a blood stain on the carpet, there is -- the door was wide open when I got there -- those kinds of assertions would be exempted from the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.860" offset="2661898">It may well be that they are likely to be correct, that they are assertions of fact that can be verified, but we've never understood that to fall outside of the ambit of the Confrontation Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.295" offset="2703590">But if you had what we can call an independent lab, that certainly -- you certainly can distinguish that from a police report.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.229" offset="2731384">It's a line-drawing question, I'll admit, but I think it's easily distinguished.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.783" offset="2821559">And I think the answer would be yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.577" offset="2828769">In fact, in Davis this Court already addressed the situation, although it reserved in the footnote, but it assumed that the 911 operator in that case, who was a private individual working for a private company hired by the -- by the police--</text>

            <text syncTime="1859.373" offset="7543975">In this case the cocaine is tied in by saying, yes, the cocaine which I delivered to X, about which he has testified, is cocaine that I took out of the pocket of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3656.941" offset="14734232">It's not considered evidence against a criminal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.235" offset="14743427">Now, in stark contrast to this case where the document is expressly citing to a statute of Massachusetts law and saying this element of the criminal charge is satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3695.738" offset="14889399">But remember, the reports in this case do not just report -- even if you accepted the solicitor's general's version that they are reporting what the machine said about the substance, they also have a paragraph before that, and this goes to Justice Scalia's question, say, these are -- these are the substances that were taken from the defendant in this case and given to me by this officer, and so, that is additional information that is being sworn to in the affidavit in this case that is also testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3768.818" offset="15181761">There are -- there are -- there are three possibility subjects: Chain of custody, conduct of test, significance or meaning of the squiggles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.268" offset="15215512">As I understand it, you have said if the chain of custody is established and if the squiggles are admitted in evidence, an expert who did not do the test can testify about the significance of the squiggles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.870" offset="15269951">But that leaves the question of the -- the evidence about the conduct of the test itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.634" offset="15292938">And I understood you to say to me that you were not conceding that you did not have a -- a confrontation right to examine the person who did the test itself in order to determine admissibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="3809.471" offset="15344347">I think what we are doing here is disagreeing slightly over where chain of custody begins and ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.593" offset="15368798">To the extent chain of custody gets you to the point at which the substance is put into the machine, and that was stipulated to or otherwise not thought about, then, yes, the printout could be introduced into evidence and anyone could testify as to what that printout means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.369" offset="15427939">But to the extent that there was a gap between the drugs getting into the laboratory and being put into the machine by somebody that the defendant was not stipulating to, then whoever did that -- if the State were going to assert this is who did it and this is the drugs that we had -- that would be something that would be subject to cross-examination.</text>
