            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="11.390" offset="151030">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.942" offset="173181">As part of the 1986 reorganization plan of the Johns-Manville Corporation, an asbestos company, the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved a settlement providing that Manville’s insurers, including The Travelers Indemnity Company and related entities, would contribute to a trust to provide compensation to present and future asbestos claimants and that in exchange the insurers would be released from all of what the settlement called “Policy Claims.”</text>
            <text syncTime="47.397" offset="295016">Policy Claims would instead by channelled to the Trust and the Court enjoined bringing any such claims against Travelers.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.939" offset="325214">The Court orders adopting the settlement agreement and reorganization plan including the injunction were affirmed on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.589" offset="355725">Over a decade later, however, asbestos claimants started bringing state court actions against Travelers, alleging that Travelers had itself violated state lore in connection with asbestos claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.331" offset="402745">Travelers returned to the Bankruptcy Court arguing that the state court actions were barred by the Court's 1986 injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.085" offset="433779">The parties subsequently entered into a settlement contingent on the Bankruptcy Court's issuing order -- an order clarifying that the state lore actions are and always have been barred by the 1986 injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.616" offset="491875">The Bankruptcy Court issued such an order and the District Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.924" offset="509116">The Second Circuit, however, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.038" offset="517580">It agreed that the actions against Travelers fall within the liberal scope of the 1986 injunction but concluded that the Bankruptcy Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in 1986 when it enjoined those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.980" offset="573377">In an opinion filed today with the clerk of the Court, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.934" offset="589155">We agree with the Circuit that the state actions constitute policy claims under the terms of the 1986 injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.082" offset="617785">The 1986 injunction defines that term broadly to include not on the claims, but even the allegations based upon arising out of or relating to Travelers' insurance coverage of Manville.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.759" offset="672434">The extensive factual findings of the Bankruptcy Court on challenge here make clear that state actions fall within the scope of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.381" offset="706915">But we part ways with the Court of Appeals at its jurisdictional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.456" offset="727291">The 1986 injunction became final over two decades ago and it is res judicata to the parties who were before the Bankruptcy Court and to those in privity with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.494" offset="771385">Whether that injunction was a proper exercise of the Bankruptcy Court subject matter jurisdiction in 1986 was not properly before the Court of Appeals in 2008 and it's not properly before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.648" offset="819973">There is no question that the Bankruptcy Court has jurisdiction today to enforce the terms of its prior order and that is all it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.079" offset="849753">Our decision is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.772" offset="856545">We do not resolve whether the Bankruptcy Court in 1986 or today could properly enjoin claims against a non-debtor, such as Travelers, for its own independent wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.601" offset="899803">Nor do we decide whether any particular claimant or entity is in fact bound by the 1986 injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.183" offset="926135">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joins.</text>
