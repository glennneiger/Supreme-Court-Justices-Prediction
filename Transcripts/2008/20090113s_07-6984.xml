            <text syncTime="7.537" offset="30121">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.948" offset="55721">After petitioner's burglary conviction became final in 1996, the state court in post-conviction and relief proceedings granted petitioner the right to file an out-of-time appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.568" offset="110265">Petitioner filed the out-of-time appeal and his conviction was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.505" offset="133984">Petitioner then sought state habeas relief for a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.789" offset="155091">After the state court's denied relief, petitioner filed a federal habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.812" offset="183199">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) establishes a one-year time limitation for state prisoners to file a federal habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.943" offset="243698">This time, limitation runs from the latest of four dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.709" offset="262820">The date that's relevant here is found at 28 U.S.C. 2244(d)(1)(A) and that is the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.178" offset="344740">Petitioner argues that his judgment did not become final until this provision -- under this provision until January 6, 2004 when time expired for seeking review in this Court of his out-of-time appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.984" offset="423943">The District Court disagreed and dismissed the petition as untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.882" offset="447453">The District Court found that the state court's decision to grant petitioner an out-of-time appeal did not change the fact that petitioner's judgment had first become final in 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.717" offset="510879">The Fifth Circuit then denied petitioner's request for a certificate of appealability.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.923" offset="535643">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.009" offset="559989">We conclude that under the plain language of the statute, when a state court reopens the right to review of a conviction by granting the right to file an out-of-time direct appeal, the conviction is no longer final for purposes of Section 2244(d)(1)(A) of AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.888" offset="651522">The state court order restores the pendency of the direct appeal allowing the possibility that the conviction will be modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.790" offset="695094">Therefore, petitioner's judgment was not final for purposes of AEDPA until January 6, 2004 when time for seeking direct review of the decision in his out-of-time appeal expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.090" offset="748384">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
