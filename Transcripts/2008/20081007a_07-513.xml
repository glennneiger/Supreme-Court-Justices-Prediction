            <text syncTime="23.079" offset="198760">Having received that notice, someone in the sheriff's department physically removed the warrant from the file and physically took the warrant back to the court clerk's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.602" offset="236899">But no one either then or later in the sheriff's department ever updated the computer file to indicate that the record had -- that the warrant had been recalled.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.791" offset="273575">As a result of that police department error, the Petitioner in this case was subject to a warrantless arrest for which there was no probable cause five months later.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.908" offset="478062">And if you look at page 41 and page 60 of the joint appendix, one of the things you'll discover about this department is that everyone in the department has access to the physical place warrants are kept.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.821" offset="557683">She discovered it because what happened is a clerk in another police department called and said, is there a warrant for Petitioner's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.808" offset="585686">She looked at the computer list on her computer and said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.677" offset="597180">Then this other warrant clerk said, please fax us a physical copy of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.712" offset="613272">So she went to the file where the warrant should have been.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.757" offset="681503">The record doesn't reflect that, but she simply I guess wanted to verify that there actually was a warrant because they were picking Petitioner up in a different county.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.455" offset="776276">That's correct, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.339" offset="783799">Our view is, just as is true with respect to probable cause, the fact that 99 percent of a department's arrests are with probable cause doesn't mean that when they arrest someone without probable cause you say, well, you get one bite at the apple or a sort of "good enough for government work" theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.654" offset="873033">And if I could give an answer to the question the Chief Justice was asking earlier that comes from Arizona v. Evans, what happened in Arizona v. Evans -- and Justice Stevens mentions this in his dissent there -- is the clerk discovered there, the court clerk discovered, that the warrant that had been, that she had verified, had in fact been recalled.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.049" offset="946594">And so what they instantly did is they checked their files, and they discovered four other warrants from that same day that had been recalled but that were still in their files.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.786" offset="973552">Here we didn't have anything done after they discovered the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.988" offset="990375">They discovered this error and, as they say, have gone on their merry way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.450" offset="7216295">The second reason is police resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.502" offset="7224445">It takes a lot of time and energy to undertake a felony arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.204" offset="7239283">Many jurisdictions have dedicated warrant forces which seek to serve outstanding warrants, and they don't want to spend their time doing it on warrants that have been recalled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.060" offset="7274705">Similarly, in a case like this, the police happened to find drugs on Petitioner's person and a gun in his car, but if they had found nothing and taken him down to the station house and booked him, that would have been taking two police officers off the street for an afternoon, wasting their resources so that they're not engaged in the kind of protection of the community that the police force wants to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.056" offset="7366656">And the third reason is that it does not create community goodwill to undertake arrests when people do not have warrants and simply because of a mistake in police records they're hauled downtown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.781" offset="7413572">That's the kind of thing that creates friction between the police and communities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.777" offset="7489536">And so I'd still say the rule, the basic rule of suppression, putting Leon to the side, basic rule is -- the opposite of Holmes: If the constable blunders, you suppress the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.739" offset="7561425">Now, our prior case -- here we have a case where the constable blundered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.012" offset="7594444">It was a different policeman, and it was a different form of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.380" offset="7611998">But five months this thing -- this warrant had been recalled five months earlier and you agree that it was negligent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.687" offset="7657242">And the virtue of our earlier case where we said don't suppress, it wasn't the constable who blundered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.275" offset="12103596">Yes, Justice Kennedy; the Court did just that and it began with the outset that the massive remedy of suppression of evidence is a high social cost that should not be borne by society, not just the police, by all of us, unless appreciable deterrence will result as a benefit; and the Court then examined the incentives that the police had not to make illegal no-knock entries and to add that whatever incremental benefit there might be from exclusion was not justified in light of the possibility of 198e liability and the increased professionalism of the police which has made it less necessary to make the exclusionary rule a remedy of first resort rather than last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.035" offset="12270571">While this Court could conceptualize the case as one in which the government is looking for an exception to the exclusionary rule, I think it's more accurately one where the Court should extend the exclusionary rule to cover negligent police clerical errors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.357" offset="12711832">I thought this case was about the second question, but now I'm confused about the first question because I suppose a policeman, an arresting officer makes a negligent error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.516" offset="12768465">He goes to the wrong house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.499" offset="12776406">And he never looks at the number; and he arrests, starts to arrest the wrong person: Is the evidence suppressed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.705" offset="12809216">If the evidence isn't suppressed, frankly, I don't see why a clerical official should be held to a higher standard; but if the evidence is suppressed then quite possibly the clerical official should be held to the same standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.132" offset="12870969">So you've heard the government say well, the answer isn't clear; very often a negligent official -- a negligent officer would not have that evidence suppressed.</text>
