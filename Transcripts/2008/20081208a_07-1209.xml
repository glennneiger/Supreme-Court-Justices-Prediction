            <text syncTime="11.022" offset="150486">Congress has directed the Veterans Court to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error in reviewing administrative determinations of veterans benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.128" offset="182983">For four reasons, the court of appeals erred in holding that the Veterans Court should presume the existence of prejudice whenever it finds that the VA has erred in providing notice to a claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.400" offset="224047">First, section 7261, the Veterans Court prejudicial error statute, uses language that is essentially identical to that of the APA's prejudicial error provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.208" offset="263231">And when Congress adopted that language in 1988, it was understood to place upon the party challenging an agency's action the burden of showing that any error was prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.481" offset="300325">Second, a notice error of the kind at issue here does not have the natural--</text>

            <text syncTime="56.503" offset="332507">Because of the Attorney General's commentary on the APA?</text>

            <text syncTime="61.622" offset="352883">--The principal reason that it was understood is because the uniform practice in the courts of appeals as of 1988 was to place upon challengers to agency action the burden of showing prejudice from the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.166" offset="415159">And the Congress was well aware of that, and in particular the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, in explaining its choice of the rule, cited the Ninth Circuit's decision in Seine &amp; Line Fishermen's Union, which expressly stated that the burden--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="93.260" offset="479525">You basically have four cases in the courts of appeals to support that proposition, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="102.449" offset="516200">And the only -- and the only cases that even suggest -- that lend any support to a contrary rule are in the very different context of notice and comment rulemaking under rule -- under section 553.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.875" offset="569908">And the reason that that's different is really for two reasons, and that is that the -- the interest that section 553 is intended to protect is not the interest of any particular commenter or any particular outcome of the rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.485" offset="636364">It's the interest of the public in having the agency's decisionmaking fully informed by all of the relevant comments.</text>

            <text syncTime="145.610" offset="688922">I mean, I think it's like you have two teams and you don't tell one of the teams when the game starts, and then you say, well, it doesn't matter because they would have lost anyway, there's no prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.000" offset="722463">The reason that in a great many cases there's not going to be prejudice from error of the kind at issue here is that the VA has an informal nonadversarial system that provides multiple layers of review and many opportunities to correct the effect of any official notice error.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.010" offset="786516">And that's illustrated by the procedural history of these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.234" offset="835417">We have never held that every agency -- you know, agencies come in many sizes and shapes -- that in all cases, the APA places the burden on the appellant or the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.475" offset="884318">But this Court has never held that across the board, no matter what agency we are talking about, that's the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.814" offset="913680">This Court has not held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.864" offset="917859">But Congress was aware that the uniform practice, certainly in agency adjudications in the courts of appeals, was to place the burden on the challengers, and Congress--</text>

            <text syncTime="221.728" offset="993405">--No, the statute at issue here is part of the Veterans Judicial Review Act of 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.298" offset="1015662">And so the relevant time we're looking at what the practice was is as of 1988 when Congress incorporated the language from the APA and placed it in section 7261.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.337" offset="1059756">And as of 1988, it was clear that the burden was on challengers.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.712" offset="1109285">Is it correct that neither of the following -- to borrow the terminology that you would use in formal litigation, and I understand this is not formal litigation before an agency, but to borrow that terminology, is it correct that the issue here doesn't concern either the burden of production or the risk of nonpersuasion before the administrative agency, before the regional office?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.577" offset="1212729">In other words, if there's -- if there is evidence that the veteran as opposed to the VA has to produce, that doesn't change, and whatever the standard is that has to be met to show an entitlement to benefits, that doesn't change either, so that all that's involved here is whether -- whatever showing needs to be made is to be made on appeal or on remand?</text>

            <text syncTime="300.895" offset="1310009">We are talking about what showing needs to be made on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.430" offset="1324116">And as this Court suggested in O'Neal, you know, the burden language is perhaps more appropriate for the context where there's -- you know, people are presenting competing evidentiary submissions to a factfinder, and that's not what we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.558" offset="1392661">--which most of the Court joined, and the reason that it says it is because it just confuses everybody, at least me, to talk about "burden" in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.664" offset="1433098">I think if O'Neal is right, it says what this is, is not involving a jury, not involving -- it's just what Justice Alito says, and following that through, what you'd -- you say to the judge: Judge, your job is to decide this.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.626" offset="1500912">Decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.809" offset="1505719">Decide whether you think that the one side -- whether there is error or whether the error is harmless or whether it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.064" offset="1542708">Decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.831" offset="1545738">Now, it could be in a rare instance the judge just can't decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.003" offset="1570503">He's in grave doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.370" offset="1579907">And so what we are talking about is what to do in that -- what should be a very, very rare instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.776" offset="1609582">Now, when I read this case, I thought that the Veterans Affairs is absolutely common sense on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.799" offset="1641660">It says: When you really don't know what to do, Judge, if the veteran got no notice at all, then probably the error was harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.356" offset="1691920">But if he got the basic notice, and all that's at issue is who should produce what or whether he thinks that he didn't know that he's supposed to produce a lot of information, well, there, you know, it would be pretty rare that it was harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.734" offset="1761405">And so you'd better say to him: Veteran, why did this hurt you?</text>
            <text syncTime="418.103" offset="1778855">That's all common sense, and it seemed to me that that's what the Veterans Court was saying, and then the Federal Circuit unfortunately, like I might have done, too, got it all mixed up with this burden of proof language.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.161" offset="1823054">Now, you tell me, legally, is that result which I am talking about sensible, and if so, how do I get there legally?</text>

            <text syncTime="461.982" offset="1954398">And so when we -- when we speak of a "burden", we mean that the challenger has the obligation, if it wants the Veterans Court to find prejudice, to articulate some theory of how there was prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.973" offset="3122385">So at that point she was aware of why her claim had been denied and what was missing, namely, evidence that her hearing had become worse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.686" offset="6401170">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to make three points: First, because notice is integral to the system that Congress designed, the VA's failure to provide notice is likely to prejudice the veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.749" offset="6485389">Second, it would be difficult for the veteran and comparatively easy for the government to carry a burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.688" offset="6517154">It would be difficult for the veteran because under the government's rule the veteran would need to engage in a speculative exercise, identifying what evidence would have been developed had the veteran been notified and had he received the full assistance of the agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.983" offset="6590401">It's -- if the -- if you are correct, and the proper resolution in a case like this is a remand, let's say all the way back to the regional office, and if before the regional office it's the veteran who will need to come forward with some evidence supporting the claim, why does it make sense to remand the case to the regional office if there is no possibility that when the case gets back there the veteran can come forward with medical evidence that's needed?</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.954" offset="6714222">Two reasons, Justice Alito: First, it's not clear even in the Veterans Court that the veteran will have notice of what's required, a point I would like to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.310" offset="6751734">But, second, if it's remanded, the process will develop as it should have in the first place, because under the statutory scheme there is both the VA and the veteran, the informed veteran, who have joint duties, and together during an interactive process they develop the evidence together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.855" offset="6821846">And during this interactive process, to answer Justice Stevens's question, the veteran is prohibited from hiring a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.259" offset="6847446">Without having the most basic notice of what's required, the veteran cannot participate in this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.929" offset="6874196">And the only way we can know how the process would really work would be to give the veteran the notice that he is entitled to in the first place and then allow the process to unfold as it should have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.624" offset="6940965">But you have a situation where the record as it has developed contains some evidence that supports the -- the veteran's position, some evidence that supports the position in favor of denial of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.800" offset="6997598">The -- the Veterans Administration, all the way up through the process, finds that the evidence contrary to the veteran's position is much stronger and denies the claim on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.692" offset="7053187">The veteran says: I didn't get notice of what exactly I needed to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.762" offset="7069487">Now, if on remand to the regional office it's still going to be -- it's going to be up to the veteran to come forward with medical evidence showing hearing loss or vision -- connecting the vision loss to something that happened in the service, why does it make sense to send it back if there's no possibility that the veteran is going to be able to do that when the case gets back?</text>
