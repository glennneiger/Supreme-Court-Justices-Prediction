            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="28">I have our opinion this morning in case 07-513, Herring versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.691" offset="26777">This is a case about whether the police can use evidence they find as a result of a mistaken arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.481" offset="53945">The petitioner, Bennie Dean Herring, went to the Sheriff's Department to retrieve something from his impounded truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.836" offset="83306">An office who saw him asked the Sheriff's Department warrant clerk to check to see if there was an outstanding warrant for Herring's arrest, there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.033" offset="120087">The officer then asked the clerk to check with her counterpart in the neighboring county, the clerk did check and that clerk checked her computer and said, “Yes, there was a warrant for Herring's arrest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="41.399" offset="165540">Acting on that information, the officer promptly arrested Herring and found methamphetamine and a gun that Herring as a felon was not allowed to possess.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.813" offset="207231">It turned out, however, that the clerk from the other county was wrong and she went to retrieve an actual copy of the warrant, she discovered that it had been recalled.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.463" offset="245788">That fact should have been noted in the computer database, but was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.282" offset="265119">She immediately called the other warrant clerk who immediately called the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.889" offset="279538">All of that took place in about 10 to 15 minutes, but Herring had already been arrested during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.765" offset="307019">Now, when Herring was prosecuted, he argued that the Government should not be allowed to use the drugs or the gun as evidence against him because they have been discovered as a result of an unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.394" offset="353517">The lower courts disagreed concluding that the evidence could be admitted even though the arrest was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.861" offset="379430">We granted certiorari to review that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.826" offset="399284">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution forbids “unreasonable searches and seizures.”</text>
            <text syncTime="106.636" offset="426555">We've held that usually requires the police to have probable cause or a warrant before arresting someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.984" offset="451946">Now, here, Herring and the Government both agreed that his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment because there was no warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.167" offset="480681">We do not decide that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.523" offset="490085">The issue instead is assuming that the arrest violated the Fourth Amendment must the evidence seized be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.719" offset="522895">Our cases have applied what is knows as the exclusionary rule under which illegally seized evidence cannot be admitted in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.055" offset="556227">This is a judicially creative rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.246" offset="565004">It is not an individual right, but instead, aims to deter violations of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.239" offset="588932">The idea is that if the police cannot use evidence from an illegal search, there is likely to be fewer illegal searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.465" offset="621847">Now, given that purpose, our precedents establish that the rule does not apply when it will not result in real deterrence or when the benefits of any deterrents are outweighed by the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.145" offset="668554">The cost of course is the prospect that the guilty and possibly dangerous will go free.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.423" offset="693631">Now, to the extent that our case has justified applying the exclusionary rule, we have said that it depends not only on its deterrent affect, but also on the culpability of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.116" offset="736472">If you look at the cases in which we developed the exclusionary rule, you will see that they involved deliberate and flagrant violations of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.844" offset="771372">The bookkeeping negligence here is a far cry from those concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.836" offset="791329">The negligent error here was neither reckless nor widespread.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.494" offset="814004">Not only was the conduct here less culpable than in the cases in which we developed the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.673" offset="838663">That fact also means that there is likely to be little deterrence from excluding the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.616" offset="862487">In a case such as this, we agree with Judge Cardozo's famous statement that the criminal should not go free because the constable has blundered.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.148" offset="896550">The evidence here need not be kept form the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.420" offset="909612">The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.383" offset="921524">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter and Breyer have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.856" offset="947437">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Souter has joined.</text>
