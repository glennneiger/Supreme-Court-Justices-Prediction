            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">I have our opinion this morning in case 08-322, Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District versus Holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.517" offset="143506">This is a case about the obligations imposed by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.943" offset="165240">That statute requires all covered jurisdictions to seek preclearance from federal authorities in Washington, D.C. before they can change anything about the way they hold elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.953" offset="209230">That requirement applies only to certain covered jurisdictions selected by a formula Congress created 35 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.870" offset="240891">When the Act was passed in 1965, the preclearance requirement was intended to last for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.588" offset="267745">Congress has repeatedly extended it.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.648" offset="275999">Most recently in 2006, Congress extended it for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.338" offset="298778">The appellant is a small utility district with an elected board.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.986" offset="313407">There is no evidence that it is ever discriminated on the basis of race in those elections, but it is located in the covered State of Texas and therefore is required to seek preclearance before it change anything about its elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.417" offset="367114">Another part of the Voting Rights Act called the bailout provision cover -- allows the covered political subdivision to file a lawsuit in Federal District Court and to be released from the preclearance requirements if certain conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.861" offset="424897">The district filed such a bailout suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.674" offset="436078">The district also argued in the alternative that if the Act does not permit it to bail out, the preclearance requirement of Section 5 is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.347" offset="474843">The Federal District Court rejected both claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.623" offset="487905">It concluded that bailout is available only to a narrow class of political subdivisions defined in the Act not to an entity like the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.844" offset="524790">It also concluded that Section 5 was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.068" offset="541717">The utility district appealed and we are therefore required to review the District Court judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.309" offset="566690">Unlike the situation with most of the cases that come before us, we do not have discretion to decline review of cases arising under these provisions of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.579" offset="611725">The historic accomplishments of the Voting Rights Act are undeniable.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.814" offset="628652">When the Act was first passed, unconstitutional discrimination was rampant and the racial gap in voter registration and turnout.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.914" offset="661044">That is the gap between white registration and turnout compared to minority registration and turnout was great.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.203" offset="690197">Today that gap has been dramatically diminished and most of the barriers to equal voting rights have long been abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.574" offset="719768">At the same time, Section 5 intrudes on the covered jurisdictions in a way otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.809" offset="752682">That aspect of the Act has, over the past 40 years, caused various members of the Court to express misgivings about the constitutionality of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.647" offset="796045">Section 5 goes beyond what is prohibited by the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.723" offset="812345">It sweeps broadly to suspend all voting changes however innocuous until they are precleared by federal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.276" offset="842543">And some of the circumstances that we have relied on in upholding Section 5 in the past have unquestionably changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.623" offset="871905">Voter turnout and registration now approach parity.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.059" offset="885697">In the forms of blatant discrimination that were common place when the Act was passed are now rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.838" offset="908790">Things have changed in the South.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.786" offset="920597">Those improvements are no doubt doing part to the Voting Rights Act and they stand as a monument to its success.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.494" offset="951421">But the Act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.515" offset="971483">The Act also differentiates between the States and ways that are intention with our fundamental tradition of equal sovereignty among the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.026" offset="1005547">Those distinctions may no longer be justified by current conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.499" offset="1023415">For example, the racial gap between voter registration and turnout is actually lower in the States originally covered by Section 5 than it is nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.218" offset="1066256">We recognized that judging the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is, as Justice Holmes once put it, the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.024" offset="1113485">We appreciate that the Members of Congress take the same oath we do to uphold the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.766" offset="1136473">Here, the District Court found that the sizeable record compiled by Congress in support of extending Section 5 documented continuing racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.016" offset="1177433">That Court also found that the preclearance requirement of Section 5 deterred discriminatory changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.113" offset="1209825">We will not shrink from our duty as Alexander Hamilton described it in the Federalist papers to serve as the bulwark of limited Constitution against legislative encroachments.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.243" offset="1254442">Part of defining that duty is the established principle that normally we will not decide a constitutional question if there is another ground upon which to dispose of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.867" offset="1296865">Here, the district also raises a statutory claim that it is eligible to bail out from the preclearance requirement and the principle of constitutional avoidance demands that we consider that claim before resting a decision on the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.387" offset="1358932">The Act allows political subdivisions to seek to bail out from the preclearance requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.232" offset="1382337">It is undisputed that the district is a political subdivision in the ordinary sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.590" offset="1403758">But the Act provides a narrower statutory definition under which the district does not qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.182" offset="1430194">The district argues that the statutory definition is inapplicable to Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.419" offset="1459137">Now in prior cases, we have held that the statutory definition does not apply in determining what entities must seek preclearance under the Act before instituting voting changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.223" offset="1506262">In light of those decisions, that definition should not constrain the availability of bailout either.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.604" offset="1531862">There must be symmetry between having to preclear and being able to bail out.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.256" offset="1554432">If the statutory definition does not apply in deciding who was covered as we have held, it should not apply in deciding who is no longer covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.422" offset="1595079">Under the Government's contrary interpretation, the bailout provision has been all but a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.372" offset="1618902">Since 1982, only 17 jurisdictions out of more than 12,000 political subdivisions covered have successfully bailed out of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.903" offset="1661012">We think it unlikely that Congress intended the bailout provision to have such limited effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.959" offset="1689224">We, therefore, hold that the district is eligible to seek bailout under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.448" offset="1711167">The district made clear that a favorable decision on bailout was an alternative to the ruling it seeks under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.467" offset="1743245">Our statutory holding, therefore, makes it unnecessary for us to reach the question of the constitutionality of Section 5 and we do not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.135" offset="1782011">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.638" offset="1811999">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</text>
