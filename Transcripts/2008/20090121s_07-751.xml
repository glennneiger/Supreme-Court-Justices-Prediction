            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="6.955" offset="134290">The first case is Pearson versus Callahan 07-751.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.770" offset="161562">This case comes to us under the certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.420" offset="180161">State law enforcement officers conducted a warrantless search of respondent's house incident to his arrest for the sale of drugs to an undercover informant whom he had voluntarily admitted to the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.909" offset="230107">The respondent sued the officers for violating his Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.048" offset="246617">The Court of Appeals held that the officers were not entitled to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.110" offset="274934">In granting review, we ask the parties to brief the additional question whether the mandatory procedure for considering qualified immunity claim set out in Saucier versus Katz should be retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.448" offset="320282">For reasons set out in an opinion filed today, we hold that the Saucier procedure should not be regarded as mandatory but should be left into the sound discretion of the District Courts and the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.227" offset="367303">We also hold that the petitioner's summary judgment motion should have been granted because it was not clearly established at the time in question that the search was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.601" offset="408889">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
