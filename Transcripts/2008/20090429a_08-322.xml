            <text syncTime="119.182" offset="476682">For instance, although the district is not a political subdivision of the county, it is in the county, and therefore under the substantive criteria, if the (.)

            <text syncTime="290.206" offset="1160777">And as the facts of this case demonstrate, not only did the county have different political interests, but we've also demonstrated that because you have entities that are subject to separate designation, like the county, that have dozens and perhaps in this case over a hundred separate political subdivisions, Travis County could never practically seek a bail out.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.011" offset="1260042">And in order to give effect to what I call this ameliorative purpose to bail out, the Court should interpret the statute in a way that allows these small entities to bail out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.596" offset="5006315">Compared to the City of Rome, the registration turnout still has two States, Virginia and Texas, with significant disparities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.247" offset="5044976">As to minority officeholders, there is a big improvement, but if you look at Mississippi, Louisiana, and South Carolina and a couple of others, it is still not great.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.949" offset="5083742">The DOJ objections: The number of DOJ objections has fallen a lot, but it still exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.101" offset="5112372">In terms of election observers, which were not mentioned in City of Rome, we have their statistics that two-thirds of the observers are focused on five of the six States that are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.566" offset="5158243">In terms of polarized voting, not mentioned in Rome, we still have testimony that the polarization is significant and common in certain places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.937" offset="5191680">And as to successful section 2, section 5 suits, once again not mentioned in the City of Rome, but since 1982 there were at least 105 successful section 5 suits and 653 successful section 2 suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.773" offset="5247060">All right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.882" offset="5403481">Massachusetts, for instance, you might be learned to know, has a white-black voter registration and turnout differential that is in the high 20s, far in excess of any covered jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.579" offset="5454263">So in addition to the argument we have that the record Congress produced is really a nondiscrimination record and not a circumvention record, we also have the argument that we've made that it is simply irrational for Congress to go back and say the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was intended to make sure that minority voters could register and vote and that's going to be our number one priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.743" offset="5546945">As Justice Ginsburg recognized, Congress believes that that has been satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3754.492" offset="15017900">And as Appellants recognize in their brief, 600 (.) notwithstanding the powerful section 5 remedy, there were 653 successful section 2 cases in covered jurisdictions, and the success rate in covered jurisdictions was much higher than in noncovered jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.830" offset="15087282">So when you put together the objections, the requests for more information followed by withdrawals, the section 5 enforcement actions, the section 2 cases, it is a picture that far exceeds the record that was before this august body when considering enactments of Congress in other contexts in Hibbs and in Lane, and the record was of intentional discrimination, not simply disparities but purposeful efforts to disadvantaged minority groups.</text>
