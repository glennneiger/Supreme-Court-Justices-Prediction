            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">The third and final statement that I have this morning is in No. 7-1078, United States against Eurodif, et al., and a companion case, United States against a company known as USEC, Inc., and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.287" offset="207642">This case has come to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.721" offset="233347">Section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930 calls for what it calls antidumping duties on foreign merchandise sold in the United States at less than its fair value, but the Act does not touch international sales of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.683" offset="301160">These cases are about the application of this provision to exchanges of low enriched uranium known as LEU, a highly processed derivative of natural uranium that nuclear utilities use to make fuel rods.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.227" offset="363332">Utilities occasionally buy LEU from foreign suppliers for a single payment in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.222" offset="387365">Usually however, they provide unenriched uranium to a foreign enricher together with enough cash to pay for the energy needed to convert the unenriched uranium to LEU, and that -- that energy is known in the industry as “separative work units” or this is the way they pronounce it or “swoo”.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.009" offset="494467">These SWU contracts treat the transaction as a sale of uranium enrichment services.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.846" offset="521843">The Commerce Department, however, determined that SWU contracts resolved in the sale of goods and therefore covered by Section 731.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.994" offset="558414">The respondents, a foreign enricher and a coalition of domestic utilities, challenged this determination before the Court of International Trade, which agreed with them and reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.220" offset="603345">The Federal Circuit then affirmed agreeing with the Court of International Trade that SWU contracts are clearly contracts of the sale of services not goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.528" offset="644514">In a unanimous opinion filed today with the clerk of Court, we reversed, because Congress charged the Commerce Department with administering Section 731, the Department's interpretation governs unless it conflicts with unambiguous statutory language whereas an unreasonable resolution of statutory ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.303" offset="727688">Although the distinction in 731 between goods and services is clear in many situations, it breaks down, whereas in a case like this, a combination of cash and a commodity here exchanged for a product that uses that very commodity as a constituent material.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.993" offset="794457">We therefore asked whether by applying 731 to SWU contracts, the Commerce Department unreasonably resolved the statutory ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.599" offset="840850">In concluding that SWU contracts result in a sale of LEU, the Department found that the parties treat the unenriched uranium as a fungible commodity and that the enricher in economic reality owns the LEU that provides the utilities prior to delivering it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.054" offset="918695">The Department emphasized that the enrichment process works what it called a substantial transformation on unenriched uranium and creates the essential character of LEU.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.709" offset="965298">These two facts in combination, the exchange of an untracked fungible commodity and a substantial transformation of that same commodity reasonably capture a common understanding of the sale of a good.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.290" offset="1015557">Moreover, these criteria find support in the purposes of antidumping duties, which is to protect domestic industry from unfairly priced foreign products.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.767" offset="1061533">If as the respondents urge SWU contracts were beyond the reach of Section 731, many other transactions could be restructured to circumvent antidumping duties as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.855" offset="1109912">Contracts for imported pasta would be replaced by separate contracts for wheat and wheat processing services, sweater imports would give way to separate contracts for wool and knitting services, and the antidumping duties would primarily chastise the uncreative.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.515" offset="1176472">The Commerce Department's attempt to foreclose this absurd result by treating SWU transactions as sale of goods is eminently reasonable.</text>
