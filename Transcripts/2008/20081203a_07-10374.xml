            <text syncTime="7.920" offset="139180">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In a 4-3 decision, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed Correction Law section 24, which prohibits Petitioner from bringing a section 1983 claim for money damages in any court of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.281" offset="212637">Instead, that statute relegates Mr. Haywood and anyone else seeking money damages under section 1983 to either bring their case in Federal court or to accept what the New York legislature has deemed a State law alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.577" offset="273763">That State law alternative does not allow Mr. Haywood to sue the prison guards who violated his civil rights; instead, he can only sue the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.349" offset="312842">It provides for no punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.635" offset="322038">It provides for no attorneys' fees, a shortened 90-day notice of claim provision, 30 days shorter than what this Court found violative in Felder.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.923" offset="359131">It provides for no right to jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="83.570" offset="441783">Your Honor, it is true that the State has waived sovereign immunity for claims brought in the court of claims under that State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.426" offset="477205">But, Your Honor, they haven't waived sovereign immunity for punitive damages or for attorneys' fees, both of which are remedies that are specifically available to Petitioners, to plaintiffs, in section 1983 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.317" offset="524748">This State law alternative, even if it didn't independently violate the Supremacy Clause by substituting New York's judgment for that of Congress, would not actually be a real alternative for Mr. Haywood or for anyone else who wanted to bring a suit against prison officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.862" offset="602906">It -- it does seem to me that there is some real benefits to the prisoners under -- under the New York scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.616" offset="625894">It's -- many counsel may think it's preferable than to sue under 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.644" offset="694021">But I think there's two important points on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.512" offset="701544">Number one, in their briefing, the Respondents have argued that they will indemnify State employees regardless of where the case is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.868" offset="738952">If the State has already agreed to provide indemnification, then you don't need the State as a defendant simply to be solvent.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.905" offset="771135">Well, except -- they said except in cases where the guards are acting outside the scope of their employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.709" offset="794331">Under Correction Law section 24, if the guard is acting outside the scope of the employment, then the case can be brought in New York's courts of general jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.615" offset="825887">The important point here, Your Honors, is that there are two separate related reasons that this law is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.952" offset="855249">The first is because New York's legislature has redefined the remedies available under section 1983, they have, in effect, substituted their judgment about what constitutes good policy for Congress's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.813" offset="918674">In this particular case, Mr. Haywood or any other plaintiff in New York State could bring a section 1983 claim in State court, but only if he agrees to give up his right to seek money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.907" offset="979069">Congress determined, in setting forth the purpose and the effect of section 1983, that plaintiffs ought to be entitled to both money damages and equitable damages.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jason E. Murtagh</label>
            <text syncTime="232.332" offset="1036748">Your Honor, it's -- Justice Scalia, it's absolutely true that Mr. Haywood could bring his case in Federal court and would be entitled to all the remedies available under section 1983, had he brought it in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.954" offset="1079275">But that issue is not dispositive in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.556" offset="1089724">And the reason it's not dispositive is that in the whole line of cases that this Court has considered where it has required States to hear actions as long as they hear similar or analogous actions, a Federal forum was available in each of those cases as well.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="260.816" stopTime="301.393">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="260.816" offset="1150746">I guess there's a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.518" offset="1157538">I mean, obviously Felder is a significant help to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.987" offset="1175406">But I suppose it's a difference to say they've redefined the cause of action under Federal law and said they are just not going to hear it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.925" offset="1211141">It may seem paradoxical, but the latter may be from a constitutional point of view the -- the sounder characterization because it's obviously not the responsibility or the authority of States to say, well, this is how the Federal law is going to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.787" offset="1274567">But it might be their -- their -- within their authority to say, look, this is what our State court system provides, and if you don't like it for a Federal claim, you've always got the Federal courts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jason E. Murtagh</label>
            <text syncTime="301.393" offset="1313019">Your Honor, under this Court's decisions not only in Felder but going back to Martinez, this Court has said that -- that it hasn't decided whether a State is required to create a court to hear Federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.867" offset="1366936">And I don't think the Court needs to reach that issue in this case, because New York has already established courts of general jurisdiction, its supreme court, the trial level court, that are competent to hear these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.794" offset="1414687">These courts regularly hear common law tort cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.662" offset="1430152">They regularly hear section 1983 claims--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="334.698" offset="1446243">Yeah, but they're not really -- or at least you can view it as they are not discriminating against the Federal cause of action, because they don't allow the State cause of action of the sort you want to pursue either.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jason_e_murtagh" startTime="344.637" stopTime="373.823">
            <label>Mr. Jason E. Murtagh</label>
            <text syncTime="344.637" offset="1486054">--Your Honor, that seems to be the crux of the Respondents' argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.589" offset="1497861">And I think the fundamental problem with that argument is that, although New York specifically exempts prison -- cases against prison officials, that's not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.313" offset="1548748">And the reason it's not enough is that if you can merely invoke the word "jurisdiction", as this Court pointed out in Howlett, the mere -- the force of the Supremacy Clause is not so weak that it can be evaded by the mere mention of the word "jurisdiction".</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="373.823" stopTime="404.758">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="373.823" offset="1602769">Well, that's -- that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.189" offset="1608202">And Howlett does say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.608" offset="1613949">But as we've pointed out on many occasions, "jurisdiction" is a term that covers a lot of different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.262" offset="1640490">And at some point something starts to look jurisdictional, which is, look, we're not going to hear your case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.833" offset="1662851">In other areas, even if they call it "jurisdictional", it really doesn't seem that way, such as, well, you've got to give this much notice or you've got to -- you know, maybe those things aren't really jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.271" offset="1708513">But saying you can't bring the case at all strikes me as really jurisdictional.</text>

          <turn speaker="jason_e_murtagh" startTime="404.758" stopTime="446.716">
            <label>Mr. Jason E. Murtagh</label>
            <text syncTime="404.758" offset="1726485">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think there are a couple of points on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.710" offset="1738292">The first is that in the cases where this Court has found that there was a neutral jurisdictional rule, Herb v. Pitcairn, Douglas, Mayfield, and then later in Johnson v. Fankell, in every single one of those cases the underlying rule of jurisdiction did not speak to the identity of the parties and did not address the underlying substance of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.258" offset="1836513">Those were rules that simply talked about how a case could move through the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.527" offset="1853544">For example, in Douglas neither party was a resident of the State of New York, and the New York court said: If you're not residents, you can't come in and use our courts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="446.716" stopTime="480.870">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="446.716" offset="1894296">That's not how it moves through the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.501" offset="1901505">That is, you don't have a forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.553" offset="1917701">That sounds to me like a jurisdictional ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.005" offset="1935464">Those cases that say, our courts don't sit to hear cases where the parties are nonresidents, both sides; our courts don't sit to hear cases about accidents that happened in Timbuktu -- those sound like we don't offer a forum for that type of case, as distinguished from here, where New York does have a forum; it just won't give one kind of relief.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jason E. Murtagh</label>
            <text syncTime="480.870" offset="2030968">Justice Ginsburg, I think -- I think that that's exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.238" offset="2044447">The point here is that in -- in -- in Douglas, where the court did not -- where the New York courts did not allow any party -- where both parties were nonresidents of New York, they wouldn't hear the case -- that applied regardless of the identity of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.664" offset="2106096">It didn't matter whether the defendant was an employee of the State of New York or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.366" offset="2120934">And it also applied regardless of what the underlying substantive claim was.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.501" offset="2137443">It didn't matter whether it was a tort action or a contract action or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.953" offset="2151236">If you weren't in New York, if you weren't a resident of New York, you couldn't take advantage of its -- of its courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.905" offset="2171089">And in -- in Herb v. Pitcairn, where you had the situation where there was a -- there was a railroad accident brought in one county court in Illinois -- it should have been brought in a different county court -- the Court went -- went out of its way to say the State of Illinois has provided other forums, other State courts where you could have brought this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.954" offset="2263249">And if the State, for example, in the present case had said, Mr. Haywood, you filed this case in Wyoming County Supreme Court and it really should have been brought down in Syracuse, that would be a neutral rule of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.677" offset="2318211">It just dictates where the case ought to be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.463" offset="2329287">By contrast, what New York has done here is that they have absolutely forbidden anyone to seek money damages against a prison official.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.450" offset="2357290">And the reason that they did that, as conceded in the Respondents' briefing, is because they don't want prison officials to be distracted from their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.758" offset="2394488">They don't want prison officials to have to face the fear of vexatious lawsuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3279.688" offset="13226214">In fact, what I was going to say is that one of the things that shows that there's no congressional policy focused only on individuals is that municipalities and other government entities are proper defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.377" offset="13273025">The State is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.079" offset="13279817">Likely, the government -- the Federal policy was -- policy found by this Court in construing 1983 for not making the State a defendant was not that that would undermine deterrence and that it was preferable to sue individuals, but that there was some reluctance -- concern about power or wisdom of imposing liability on the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.127" offset="13371977">And, in fact, that is what this Court said in Monell and Will about why the State is not a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.265" offset="13392562">So I don't think 1983 is fairly read as embracing a congressional judgment that it's better to have liability against individuals, better from the plaintiffs' point of view, than against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.954" offset="13435298">But the way this works is it is, in effect, a -- a mandatory removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.025" offset="13455569">And since Congress has no objection, has not prohibited removal the way it did in FELA cases, it's hard to see how the congressional policy is frustrated by this mandatory removal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.069" offset="13523696">Mr. Chief Justice, just very briefly, General Underwood just mentioned that -- that this could be analyzed as a mandatory removal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.192" offset="13560268">The distinction, Your Honors, is that what New York State does when it removes these cases to Federal court is it uses an avenue that's provided by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.531" offset="13601541">And, certainly, if Congress wants to provide for removal to Federal court, Congress can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.352" offset="13624842">What the State cannot do is come in and interpose its policy judgment over and above what Congress has decided with respect to Federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.958" offset="13659324">Very quickly, I would like to address a second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.175" offset="13672176">General Underwood pointed out that there are a lot of large prisons in rural counties in New York State; and, therefore, there are a lot of cases that might be brought in those courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.265" offset="13708539">There is no dispute in this case, Your Honors, that if New York wanted to have a statute that said those cases will be transferred to the less busy courts of our State, that would be okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.323" offset="13756709">That would be a neutral rule of judicial administration related to the operation of the courts that's unrelated to the substance or the identity of the parties.</text>

Michigan this Court said the State is not a person.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.381" offset="14104973">This is a statute, though, that the -- that the New York Legislature has -- has dealt with over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.618" offset="14125976">One of the important things is that in the 1970s -- and I apologize for not having the exact date -- the New York Legislature said that the purpose of this was to provide immunity to corrections officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.176" offset="14172160">And as we pointed out in our briefing, there is a bill currently pending before the New York Legislature that says, we want to extend the same immunity that we provide to prison officials to employees of the Office of Mental Health--</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.268" offset="14236526">The neutral reason is the State sees there are just too many cases in which prisoners are suing correctional officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.374" offset="14268918">So then they say: Here's what we are going to do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.826" offset="14278740">First, under State law, we'll wipe out all the suits and give them instead an action against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.647" offset="14302041">But we know there are still some Federal cases about the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.266" offset="14316565">So what we're going to do is we're going to say bring them in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.968" offset="14327327">Why bring them in State court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.170" offset="14336104">So now we've dealt with our administrative problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.205" offset="14348330">So that's their neutral administrative reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.074" offset="14359719">Now, people would like to bring 1983 actions still in State or Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.608" offset="14377900">It may be more convenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.658" offset="14382080">They get attorneys' fees, and the attorneys' fees you don't get under the State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.012" offset="14399530">So why isn't -- or why is -- or I guess that's the question for me: Is this an adequate, neutral, administrative reason or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="3604.816" offset="14526694">And, as in many cases, the people who are charged with defending those statutes think of very good reasons which are very plausible that could have motivated the people involved, and they've come up with the one that you have heard.</text>
