            <text syncTime="8.454" offset="141270">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The ability to locate and track an enemy submarine through the use of mid-frequency active sonar is vitally important to the survival of our naval strike groups deployed around the world and therefore critical to the nation's own security.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.833" offset="214831">In this case the Ninth Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction that places serious restrictions on the Navy's use of MFA sonar in training exercises that in the judgment of the President and his top naval officers are in the paramount interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.029" offset="287556">That injunction is fundamentally flawed for three principal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.731" offset="306364">First, it is based on an erroneous assessment of the likelihood of success on Respondent's NEPA claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.520" offset="337502">Second it is based on an erroneous conception of the showing of irreparable injury necessary to secure what this Court has aptly called "the extraordinary and dramatic remedy" of a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.362" offset="392882">And finally, it fails to take account the vital public interests in conducting the training exercises at issue unencumbered by the injunction's restrictions.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="81.468" offset="433319">General Garre, when you address the injunction, do you mean the injunction as originally ordered by the district court or are you taking account of the modification made by the Ninth Circuit, and would you say that the three points you just made would apply as well to the injunction as modified?</text>

            <text syncTime="108.201" offset="540317">Obviously our position on the NEPA claim is the same with respect to any aspect of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.670" offset="562155">So too with the risk of irreparable harm which we think Respondents haven't shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.557" offset="585665">The Ninth Circuit did modify the injunction by issuing a partial stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.145" offset="608026">It's important to keep in mind that its modifications were tied only to a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.782" offset="630596">It didn't actually modify the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.067" offset="639687">So even if this Court thought those modifications were appropriate, it would have to vacate the Ninth Circuit decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.795" offset="714606">That stay and therefore those modifications remained in effect only until this Court issued its decision in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.144" offset="804049">Well, yes, we are here complaining about the restriction on the 2200-yard shutdown requirement, where if a marine mammal comes within 2200 yards of a naval vessel part of one of these strike groups it has to shut down sonar operations, as well as the 75 percent powerdown requirement when significant surface ducting conditions are present regardless of the presence of marine mammals.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.532" offset="933616">On the other side, could you say what the record shows about the number of marine mammals that are likely to be killed or receive actual physical injury if the -- as opposed to some sort of behavioral modification, if the injunction is allowed to continue?</text>

            <text syncTime="225.677" offset="1010207">The record -- and here I'm referring to the environmental assessment and the opinion of the National Marine Fisheries Services in the petition appendix and the joint appendix -- indicates that no marine mammal will be killed as a result of these exercises.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.686" offset="1066214">The environmental assessment predicted there would be eight instances of injurious harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.490" offset="1089411">These eight instances would take place only with respect to a common species of dolphins of which there are hundreds of thousands in the Southern California Operating Area.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.930" offset="1123161">Now, the environmental assessment also predicted that there would be a much greater number, 170,000 over the course of two years, of so-called Level B takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.070" offset="1167778">These are temporary and by definition non-injurious disturbances and that's made clear at pages 258a of the petition appendix and page 175 of the JA, which make clear that these Level B disturbances, the vast majority of the disturbances predicted by the environmental assessment, are temporary and non-injurious.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.564" offset="1337678">As to -- the number may be actually a little bit lower in the Southern California Operating Area.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.718" offset="1354292">But this is -- no one suggests that is in any way a threatened species.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.670" offset="1370175">With respect to the species that are endangered, threatened, or even strategic under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the National Marine Fisheries Services concluded there would be no adverse harm on the population level or with respect to annual recruitment rates with respect to those endangered or threatened species in the biological opinion that the district court sustained and that Respondents are not challenging on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.202" offset="1468291">The focus of their claim of irreparable injury -- and keep in mind that that environmental assessment comes against the backdrop of a 40-year history of the Navy's use of MFA sonar in the Southern California Operating Area at the same frequency and, if anything, during more frequent training exercises than have been conducted in recent years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.991" offset="7475409">The first was that the Navy had affidavits which says -- they say -- I read them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.930" offset="7511144">But they said that: You are requiring us, judge, to turn the sonar down to six decibels or up to six, whatever, whenever we had to run into a situation called layering of different temperature levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.857" offset="7566942">And we tell you, as naval officers, that that's just where submarines like to hide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.843" offset="7586795">And we also tell you that if we can't train people to do that they will miss out on an important part of how to find these submarines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.099" offset="7627860">The second thing they said was that: We're willing to turn off the sonar if there's any marine mammal that comes within 500 yards, which is a quarter of a mile, about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.590" offset="7673835">But you insist that we turn off the sonar when any animal comes within a mile and a quarter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.828" offset="9850776">The Navy tries to dismiss those by saying we only graded the effects on beaked whales as Level A because we did that as a matter of generous policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.904" offset="9903125">They did it because that's what the science compels, because beaked whales have stranded repeatedly around the world correlated -- caused by in the views of scientists, and the evidence is overwhelming, by sonar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.950" offset="9975223">And the reason that happens especially to beaked whales is because they dive for very long periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.769" offset="10002495">And when they dive for very long periods of time, and they are then bombarded with sonar, which by the way in sound intensity, in this courtroom if we had a jet engine and you multiplied that noise by 2,000 times, correcting for water, that's the sound's intensity that would be going on in the water if you were a marine mammal near that source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.521" offset="10109597">The beaked whales, the scientists believe, adjust their diving patterns; since they dive down for so long, if they come up too fast, they get the bends so there is evidence of -- when they do the necropsies of these beaked whales, they find hemorrhaging, the embolisms in various parts of the bloodstream and many, many deaths.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.640" offset="13418057">First, responding to that very point, it's common ground among the litigants and certainly with the court that the interests ascribed by the President and by every other government official with respect to Naval training are of the highest importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.034" offset="13491618">The question was -- and this is the court's factual finding, and the question is whether there was sufficient record evidence to support it, whether she was right that there wouldn't be an adverse effect except for possibly some logistical changes, but no adverse effect in the conduct and achievement of the training.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.830" offset="13562776">If there's no adverse effect, then what the President is speaking to is speaking past what's concerning the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.250" offset="13588480">Now, with respect to irreparable harm, the argument that General Garre made I think mistakenly collapses the normal equity issue in this following sense: Once a plaintiff satisfies Article III, very important, and under the Japan Whaling case, the Lujan v. National Wildlife case, there is no question that these plaintiffs deserve to be in court, and it has never been contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.073" offset="13719719">Then you move to the traditional equity standard for assessing irreparable harm, Hecht v. Bowles, but in the environmental area we have a decision, the Amoco v. Gambell decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.842" offset="13838838">And I think, Justice Scalia, if you look at your opinion in the second Lujan case and you think about the imminence requirement of standing there, what irreparable harm adds to that is the traditional need to show that the harm you suffer cannot be quantified in damages or it's difficult to quantify, and that a remedy at law will not achieve the adjustment between the parties that's required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.861" offset="13966942">That's what equity does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.063" offset="13971749">Equity preserves the positions of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.931" offset="13983242">And as this Court said in Amoco, environmental injury, by it's very nature, can seldom be adequately remedied by money damages and is often permanent or at least of long-lasting duration, i.e., irreparable; that is Amoco at page 545.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.291" offset="14048653">If such injury is sufficiently likely, therefore, the Court said, the balance of harms will usually favor the issuance of an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.380" offset="14085016">Now, there's one other point which was briefly touched on here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.534" offset="14109571">Now, the circuits have said different things about irreparable harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.771" offset="14122527">The leading edge of discussion in the circuits began with then-Judge Breyer on the First Circuit in the Massachusetts v. Watt and Sierra Club v. Marsh cases, where he pointed out that NEPA itself has, while it's a procedural statute, a substantive purpose, the substantive purpose being informed decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.518" offset="14213538">And if there is not informed decisionmaking before there is an agency committed to action, a harm has occurred.</text>
