            <text syncTime="7.979" offset="139389">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The principal question before the Court today is whether nonparties to an arbitration agreement that are otherwise entitled to enforce that agreement under State law are foreclosed as a matter of law from seeking relief under section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.645" offset="214100">Respondents' argument that section 3 forecloses such relief to nonparties is contrary to both the text of section 3 and the structure of the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.860" offset="250880">Nothing in the text of section 3 forecloses nonparty enforcement rights, and under the structure of the Act section 3 is a procedural device to enforce, rather than a substantive limitation upon, State-law arbitration rights made applicable by section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.774" offset="314514">I'll begin with the text of section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.461" offset="325277">Under section 3, a stay is mandatory if the issue in suit is, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="59.039" offset="343667">"referable to arbitration under such an agreement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="62.302" offset="356728">We contend that there are three elements to determine whether or not an issue is referable to arbitration under the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.612" offset="381910">First, the applicant must be able to enforce the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.314" offset="392673">Second, the plaintiff must be bound by the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.281" offset="404584">And, third, the claim must fall within the scope of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.969" offset="415347">Nothing in section 3 limits who can enforce the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.778" offset="430602">To answer that question we have to turn to section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.768" offset="534570">Likewise, in section 4 there's a reference to parties, and it's parties to the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.421" offset="561110">So section 3 refers to parties to the action in which the section 3 stay is sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.989" offset="639373">But the controversy in this case is a tort claim against various defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.583" offset="657763">And that -- the Petitioners in this case assert that they are entitled to enforce the arbitration clause, and under that clause this controversy is supposed to be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.390" offset="697051">Now, section 2 is the primary substantive provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.860" offset="710949">Section 2 establishes that questions concerning the enforceability of an arbitration agreement, including who may enforce that agreement, are decided by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.184" offset="748251">This Court's decision in Perry v. Thomas recognized and applied this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.414" offset="769149">In Perry, this Court remanded to State court to decide the question of whether nonparties could enforce an arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.148" offset="796108">In so doing, this Court instructed the lower court to apply State law to determine the very question that's before this case, whether non -- before this Court, whether nonparties could enforce the arbitration agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.362" offset="840934">In practice, are there decisions in which -- and I'm assuming that you are right on the jurisdictional question -- in which a nonparty to the arbitration agreement but a party to the litigation has, in fact, succeeded in getting a stay under section 3?</text>
            <text syncTime="201.713" offset="914286">I mean, one question is -- and that's the question on the merits -- assuming that a -- that a party to the litigation, not a party to the arbitration agreement, can come to court and say, court, stay the action pending arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.657" offset="1002057">Have there been cases in which section 3 stays have been issued on the request of someone who is not party to the arbitration agreement but is a litigant in the case?</text>

            <text syncTime="240.853" offset="1070916">And there -- there are numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.179" offset="1076140">In fact, for the last 60 years it has been a recognized, settled principle of FAA law that nonparties to an arbitration agreement that are otherwise entitled to enforce the agreement are able to seek and obtain stays under section 3.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.112" offset="1143954">It means they -- they have the capacity to apply under section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.327" offset="1168823">I was just wondering how in practice -- I mean, here's a case where you have three parties together counseling a certain tax shelter.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.568" offset="1269760">My question is, conceding jurisdiction, it seems to me unlikely that a court would listen to two such people who were perfectly equipped to get an arbitration agreement themselves and didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.027" offset="1347605">Well, Your Honor, it depends upon the facts and the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.261" offset="1356487">It may well be that those nonparties have no arbitration rights, in which case a section 3 stay would not be available -- available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.290" offset="1388669">The question is whether they have rights under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.242" offset="1400477">If they do have rights under State law to enforce the arbitration agreement to which they are not parties, then they are entitled to a section 3 stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.972" offset="1447393">It may very well be that in whatever ultimate forum the case is thrashed out in that the -- that the non-signatories will be able to enforce the arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.373" offset="1496921">The question here is whether they can get a stay in midstream in order to litigate that as a separate issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.871" offset="1526909">And one argument for saying that they should not, that the stay right should be limited to signatories, is that the policy of the -- the Federal Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.412" offset="1585110">It is not a policy simply to promote arbitration under all possible circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.051" offset="1607680">It is a policy to enforce contracts because the contracts, in effect, were being given short shrift before the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.654" offset="1642057">If the policy is one to enforce contracts and, as Justice Ginsburg said, they had a chance to make an arbitration agreement and they didn't do it, then that is a good reason to say the Federal courts will not stay the proceedings in midstream for somebody who didn't get the agreement that that person could have gotten.</text>

            <text syncTime="2423.935" offset="9803233">And, therefore, it is sensible as a matter of Federal policy to say, we're not going to stop this trial in mid-track for arbitration unless you who are asking for it to be stopped signed an arbitration agreement yourself, and it's that agreement that you're trying to enforce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.741" offset="12638459">So what the District Court did in that -- in that case, it entertained the stay as a discretionary stay, and it granted it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.105" offset="12895922">The only sense in which an issue in this case was ever referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing is under the Bricolage agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.504" offset="12949525">Once Bricolage departed the case, that obligation that -- that Respondents may have had to arbitrate with Bricolage became inoperative, and what I see Petitioners attempting to do is to disaggregate that the obligation that Respondents undertook to arbitrate with Bricolage from Bricolage's reciprocal obligation, detach it, and run away with it as if it's a fungible commodity and say we are now owed this obligation, when -- contrary to everything this Court has ever said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.471" offset="13117336">That's not the way the FAA works, because with the FAA the starting point, as this Court said in Mitsubishi, is did the parties agree to arbitrate that dispute?</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.374" offset="13168953">And if we're talking about the -- the absence of Bricolage, I think we're -- we're dealing with a case where even among the equitable estoppel cases, this case will turn out to be an outlier because of Bricolage's absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.100" offset="13243873">I say that because we're also dealing with accountants who were their accountants for 25 years before Bricolage came along.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.623" offset="13885962">This case should be remanded to the Court of Appeals to decide the question of whether on these facts, these nonparty Petitioners can actually enforce section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.794" offset="13922638">The -- the Petitioners' quarrel is with the doctrine of equitable estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.698" offset="13938312">They don't like it, but there's nothing in the text of section 3 that allows this Court or any court to distinguish between the various doctrines or legal theories that nonparties may seek to which -- to enforce section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.335" offset="13984810">We happen to have used section 3, happen to have invoked equitable estoppel as the basis for invoking section 3, but it could have been assignment, it could have been third-party beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.391" offset="14025038">They have -- Respondents have conceded the principle that section 3 is available to provide relief to nonparties who are otherwise entitled to enforce the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.919" offset="14059102">They just think that on the merits we don't satisfy the requirements of equitable estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.107" offset="14075925">That's a question to be decided on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.088" offset="14083866">Equitable estoppel, I will say very briefly, presupposes the existence of a written arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.633" offset="14109989">In the absence of a written arbitration agreement, Petitioners here would not have any ability to assert this theory of equitable estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.428" offset="14141231">So -- so it's not completely separated from or detached from the existence of a written arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.800" offset="14170697">I'd like to turn to Justice Souter's signatory test for allowing relief under section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.970" offset="14195357">With all respect, this defies 80 years of case law interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.265" offset="14216568">It defies the history of the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.558" offset="14225659">It's settled that Congress, in enacting this Act, chose New York law, and the New York Arbitration Act lad a much more stringent requirement for arbitrating existing disputes which required a signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.163" offset="14272157">Congress, as we outlined in our brief, did not choose that section of the New York law as a model when it enacted the FAA in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.052" offset="14303713">1292(b) -- the right to appellate jurisdiction is illusory because if that is denied, a nonparty with arbitration rights would be forced to litigate and lose the very things that arbitration is designed to avoid -- that is, the cost and time of being in litigation in a district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.060" offset="14383752">Not only that, the district court will suffer the loss of judicial efficiency by having to litigate -- litigate a case before it or adjudicate a case that should be in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.741" offset="14426384">Unless there are any further questions, I will conclude the argument.</text>
