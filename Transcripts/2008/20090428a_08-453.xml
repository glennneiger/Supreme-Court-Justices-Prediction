            <text syncTime="30.185" offset="228206">This unusual enforcement pre-emption, which detaches the State's power to make laws from its power to enforce them, was not written into the National Bank Act by Congress in 1864, and it's implausible that Congress implicitly delegated to OCC the power to read it in now.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.563" offset="305737">We know the NBA did not in 1864 enact enforcement pre-emption against the States for three reasons: First, the words of the statute; second, a long line of cases from this Court, especially St. Louis, upholding the power of the State to enforce laws against a national bank or rejecting it on the ground that the law was substantively pre-empted, but not questioning the power of the State to enforce a valid law; and, finally, the wholly anomalous character, foreign really to our structure of government, of separating the power to make law from the power to enforce it.</text>

            <text syncTime="921.462" offset="3793293">Well, because you can look at books and records under various authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.349" offset="3812833">Books and -- you can look at books and records under your visitorial authority, if you are the supervisor and have the relationship to the bank that a licensing or chartering authority has and you are looking at them for no particular cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.441" offset="3869257">Or you can look at books and records if you have a civil suit against the bank and you are engaging in discovery that is -- or for that matter a criminal prosecution against the bank, and ancillary to that discovery is required; or in Guthrie, the inquiry -- the looking at books and records was pursuant to a statutory authority for shareholders to look at books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.455" offset="3961313">So the simple fact of a physical act of looking -- or a legal act of looking at books and records doesn't tell you whether visitorial authority is being exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.762" offset="4006557">Visitorial authority has long been understood as a whole regime of oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.435" offset="4033202">Watters involved a visitorial regime that was ancillary to licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.070" offset="4055771">The earlier visitorial regimes that were referenced in the old treatise tended to involve visitorial regimes that were established ancillary to chartering, back when corporate charters had limited purposes, the way banks do still, but most corporate charters, most corporate certificates of incorporation don't anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.051" offset="4135706">So the fact that books and records are being examined is neither here nor there on the question whether the visitorial power that is referenced in 484 is -- is being exercised.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.554" offset="4353672">But actually what it was meant to do was assign responsibility for the supervision of these new entities -- there hadn't been banks like this, private banks which were nevertheless federally chartered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.195" offset="4408216">Before that there was the National Bank that was at issue in McCulloch v Maryland, and to exclude the States from asserting the authority to do audits, to do regular banking examinations, which actually one senator had proposed the States be permitted to do and that was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.823" offset="4478746">I would say the concern about State hostility was apparently much reduced by 1869, not much after this statute was passed, when this Court in National Bank v. Kentucky upheld the power of the States not just to tax shareholders on their shares, but to require the national banks to help, to require the national banks to pay the tax that was due from those shareholders in order to assist in collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.807" offset="4586684">And the Court -- McCulloch was cited to the Court and the Court said it saw no possibility here, unlike in McCulloch, that the State would somehow use its authority in this way to incapacitate the banks or impair them by eliciting their help to collect a valid tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.404" offset="4669127">There actually had been some thought when the national banks were first created that they would, in the marketplace, drive State banks out of existence, but they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.862" offset="4710922">And the story has been one legislatively of maintaining competitive equality between them, not of hostility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.384" offset="6280986">And Justice Breyer raised the possibility that a myriad of State attorneys general would file -- would pursue similar antidiscrimination claims, and Ms. Underwood's response was there really would be no problem because they are all applying the same substantive standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.810" offset="6338664">And I think at a very high level of generality that is so; that is, the Federal statute and the State statute both say no discrimination on the basis of race in extensions of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.432" offset="6377221">But I think when you get to the way in which the statutes are administered, there is at least the potential for significant differences, because--</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.070" offset="9615778">--Well, the other point I would make about this is that it is accurate to say that under the Federal regime the State is entirely disabled from enforcing its own fair lending law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.508" offset="9653499">As Ms. Underwood alluded to in the opening part of the argument and as the Petitioner's reply brief explains at pages 25 and 26, the Fair Housing Act does contain a mechanism by which a State agency -- in the case of New York, it's the Division of Human Resources -- can be certified by HUD to enforce the State fair lending laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.922" offset="9735105">But that certification entails two different steps: First, HUD has to determine that the substantive State law is -- I believe it's substantially equivalent to the comparable Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.147" offset="9776065">And, second, HUD monitors the performance of the enforcing agency, the particular agency under State law that carries out that responsibility, and HUD can thereby make sure that enforcement as well as the substance of the law are consistent with Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.689" offset="10158184">The only -- so everyone agreed that was a visitorial regime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.089" offset="10267794">But this Court, in section II A of Watters -- and we did have a State statutory regime that dealt, yes, with licensure but also with examination, supervision, and enforcement, including judicial enforcement -- this Court repeatedly described that what was pre-empted is -- and this goes to, I think, a point that Justice Scalia was making -- was not substantive pre-emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.003" offset="10351491">There are substantive pre-emption provisions that are addressed in other sections of the Act, including the one that was at issue in Smiley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.157" offset="10376046">What is exempted, this Court said again and again, is the State's enforcement and investment and -- investigative and enforcement machinery, or its examination and enforcement authority, and that those--</text>
