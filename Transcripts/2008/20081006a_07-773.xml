            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Ortiz</label>
            <text syncTime="6.070" offset="24270">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case poses two substantive issues: First, whether section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act impliedly repeals section 1331's "well-pleaded complaint" requirement?</text>
            <text syncTime="19.394" offset="77559">Only if it does can a district court look through a petition to compel arbitration that itself contains no Federal question to ground Federal subject matter jurisdiction on a Federal question lurking somewhere in the dispute sought to be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.202" offset="132835">And, second, if section 4 does repeal this part of section 1331, can a completely pre-empted State-law counterclaim in a pending State-court lawsuit furnish look-through jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="45.425" offset="181631">Your Honors, at bottom this is ae dispute between two radically different conceptions of Federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.043" offset="204097">One view, Respondents', is so broad as to allow parties to compel arbitration in Federal court of nearly any dispute concerning credit card debt; and one, Petitioner's, narrowly confined subject matter jurisdiction to those disputes where the arbitration agreement itself arguably arises under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.993" offset="287897">But, Your Honors, the ordinary, the original meaning of section 4, the structure of the overall Federal Arbitration Act, and the purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act all militate strongly in favor of the Petitioner's view of subject matter jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.918" offset="355607">First, the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.054" offset="364175">The words "save for such agreement", Your Honors, as the words "save for" themselves suggest, necessarily imply that the agreement exerts some negative effect on otherwise existing jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="107.916" offset="431675">That simply means that you can't bring an action in Federal court because the agreement says you can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.670" offset="462604">The agreement says you've got to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.605" offset="470441">So if you throw the agreement out save for such agreement, the question is whether or not you could then bring the action in Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.710" offset="502833">Your Honor, the -- those words "save for such agreement" were originally intended to refer to the hoary doctrine of ouster, which barred the Federal courts from subject matter jurisdiction in such suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.487" offset="565945">The words "but for" suggest that the agreement itself somehow impairs jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.576" offset="598232">Mr. Ortiz, why isn't section 2 of the Arbitration Act sufficient to take care of the ouster doctrine, whatever may have been left of it?</text>

            <text syncTime="168.704" offset="674823">At the time when section 2 was enacted, the Federal courts were still split between law and equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.691" offset="698751">Section 2 by itself could well have made such arbitration agreements enforceable, but only in law.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.998" offset="743995">I'm not sure that I follow that, because it seems to me -- where did this doctrine of ouster come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="194.169" offset="776701">It came from the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.871" offset="783492">The courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration agreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.925" offset="807630">Why would a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule never made any sense in the first place, so we're not going to follow it?</text>
            <text syncTime="216.018" offset="864054">It's not any rule that Congress has imposed on the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.492" offset="909925">As Justice Story wrote in Tobey v. County of Bristol, bills in equity were thought in the Federal courts to be ill-founded in point of jurisdiction to support a motion to compel arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.168" offset="976694">And so although under section 2 such an agreement might be enforceable in law -- damages might be available, penalty clauses might be enforced in law, a party might also be able to recover the expenses incurred in an arbitration that was revoked before the arbitration came to its conclusion -- that would not be clear that--</text>

            <text syncTime="269.264" offset="1077004">This was never a notion that Congress enforced on the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.620" offset="1102500">They imposed it on themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.403" offset="1113576">So my question remains why shouldn't the Court then say this agreement has been declared enforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to recommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any more; we can change it?</text>

            <text syncTime="308.424" offset="1233635">The only question is whether section 2 would do so by itself or whether section 4 was necessary because of the division between law and equity at the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.912" offset="1603633">Under law, there was some room in some jurisdictions for there to be enforcement, not across the board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.428" offset="5649687">The closest Respondent comes to sort of explaining this or trying to jump or leap over this gap, are two amici, two law professors, who argue that this Court should find jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction under sections 7, 9, 10 and 11 as an emanation from sections 3 and 4, only one of which actually has the necessary "save for" language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.433" offset="6605664">The statute says that a party aggrieved by the alleged failure to arbitrate -- and we have that precisely in this case because the other side has filed a lawsuit against our indemnitee arising out of an underlying dispute -- may petition any United States district court which, save for such an agreement -- it's pretty clear that everybody agrees that in this context you just simply put the agreement aside -- and then you say would have jurisdiction under Title 28 in a civil action of the subject matter of the suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.090" offset="6960302">So it's not appropriate simply to say to yourself look at what litigation actually exists, because in as many cases as not there is not going to be any litigation ongoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.512" offset="6998023">So the court has to make the hypothetical: would the court have had jurisdiction over the subject matter of this dispute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.451" offset="7025817">And the dispute in this case, which Professor Ortiz was very explicit about -- he said specifically that if he had brought this as an affirmative lawsuit it would have arisen under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.390" offset="7069494">It seems to me that's as clear a concession that the nature of this dispute is a question of Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.853" offset="7683372">I mean, first of all, the arbitration agreement is quite explicit in saying that if, if you -- if this starts off as litigation and then a subsequent claim is made by either of the parties, the parties have the right to enforce the arbitration as to that particular claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.832" offset="7743349">So that's specifically what we did in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.284" offset="7757141">So in theory, at least the collection action would remain in State court as a State cause of action, although it would certainly be available to the Petitioner in this case to say, well, no, if you're going to arbitrate that portion of the case then I'm content to arbitrate the rest of the case as well.</text>
