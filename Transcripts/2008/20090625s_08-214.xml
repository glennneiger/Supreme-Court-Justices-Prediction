            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Thomas has the opinion of the Court today in case 08-214, Atlantic Sounding Company versus Townsend.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="8.118" offset="138888">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and I'm sure it's one of much greater interest than the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.520" offset="204507">Respondent, Edgar L. Townsend, was injured while serving as a crew member on the Motor Tug Thomas, no relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.144" offset="254976">This tug is a vessel owned by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.389" offset="272008">Respondent filed a suit against petitioners under the Jones Act and general maritime law contending among other things that petitioners' improperly denied him maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.517" offset="332507">Maintenance and cure is the term used to describe the longstanding obligation of vessel owners to provide food, lodging, and medical treatment to injured crewmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.969" offset="382349">Respondent sought punitive damages for the denial of maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.439" offset="408158">Petitioners sought to dismiss the punitive damages claim arguing that this Court's decision in Miles versus Apex Marine Corporation limits recovery for the denial of maintenance and cure to remedies available under the Jones Act and that punitive damages are not available under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.515" offset="504498">The District Court denied the motion to dismiss finding that punitive damages are available under general maritime law and authorized an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.792" offset="561654">The Court of Appeals affirmed holding that it was bound by certain precedent to permit claims for punitive damages for a willful failure to provide maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.325" offset="611704">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.275" offset="639498">Punitive damages have long been available at common law and this tradition extends to maritime cases or maritime claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.121" offset="682966">There is no evidence that claims for maintenance and cure were excluded from this general admiralty rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.237" offset="711387">To the contrary, the pre-Jones Act evidence indicates that punitive damages were available to such claim -- for such claims under the appropriate factual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.233" offset="767394">Moreover, the enactment of the Jones Act in 1920 did not abridge the traditional remedies afforded under general maritime law for maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.120" offset="818907">We have repeatedly held that the Act was intended to supplement rather than restrict traditional remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.577" offset="852762">Finally, this Court's decision in Miles does not limit the remedies of this general maritime claim to those remedies provided by the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.319" offset="899678">In Miles, the Court restricted memories -- remedies for wrongful death to those that Congress had statutorily provided in wrongful death actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.750" offset="949415">But the Court did so because wrongful death actions were not historically recognized under general maritime claims or maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.148" offset="995077">Here in contrast, the cause of action for maintenance and cure and the remedy of punitive damages were available long before the Jones Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.098" offset="1042829">Miles does not require the Court to alter the historically availability -- the historical availability of punitive damages for the willful or wanton failure to comply with the duty of maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.613" offset="1108867">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy have joined.</text>
