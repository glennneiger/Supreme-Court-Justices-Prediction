            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in case 07-984, Coeur Alaska, Inc. versus Southeast Alaska Conservation Council and the consolidated case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="11.925" stopTime="278.424">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="11.925" offset="153119">These cases require us to decide whether a plan to dispose of mining waste violates the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.339" offset="182794">The petitioner Coeur Alaska owns Kensington Gold Mine in Southeast Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.624" offset="207872">When it opens and begins its operation, extracting the gold will produce several million tons of crushed rock mixed with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.910" offset="245070">This mixture is called slurry and its waste and it must be put somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.805" offset="268685">Coeur Alaska plans to put the slurry in a small lake near the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.071" offset="281746">The slurry will kill the lake's fish and plant life.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.348" offset="294808">After the mine closes, however, coeur Alaska will cover the lake bed with soil and thereby reclaim it.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.998" offset="317377">The broader and shallower lake will sustain at least as much aquatic life as it does now.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.381" offset="338902">If the slurry did not go in the lake, Coeur Alaska will propose to put it on nearby wetlands destroying them permanently.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.328" offset="370772">Coeur Alaska obtained approval for its plan from two agencies that administer the Clean Water Act, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency or the EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.870" offset="424897">The Corps of Engineers acts under Section 404 of the Act and EPA acts under Section 402 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.675" offset="456140">Acting under Section 404, the Corps of Engineers issued Coeur Alaska a permanent to discharge the slurry into the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.804" offset="488636">And acting under Section 402 of the Act, the EPA issued Coeur Alaska a permit to discharge water from the lake into a downstream creek.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.800" offset="524581">Respondent's three environmentalist groups led by the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council were SEACC sued the agencies in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.677" offset="568153">SEACC made two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.452" offset="575258">First, SEACC argued that to put its slurry in the lake in the first place, Coeur Alaska requires a permit from the EPA not the Corps of Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.823" offset="616741">Second, SEACC argued that the slurry discharge violates an EPA regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.343" offset="650804">Now, the EPA regulation is called performance standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.971" offset="665328">It forbids the discharge of waste from gold mine like Coeur Alaska's.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.780" offset="684554">The Court of Appeals agreed with both SEACC's arguments and it vacated the Corps of Engineers' permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.524" offset="707542">We granted certiorari and we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.084" offset="721753">We disagree with both SEACC's arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.331" offset="730739">First, the Clean Water Act states the Corps of Engineers and not the EPA, is the proper agency to issue a permit for the slurry discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.695" offset="768251">This is because slurry is defined by the regulation as fill material.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.462" offset="783297">In Section 404 of the Act authorizes the Corps to permit discharges of fill material.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.936" offset="805136">Section 402 by contrast states that the EPA may not issue permit for these discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.894" offset="828959">Second, SEACC argues that EPA's performance standards forbid the slurry discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.445" offset="851216">Both agencies disagree with that position however.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.859" offset="868874">In the view of both agencies, the EPA's performance standard does not apply to discharges of fill material because the statute and regulations do not give a clear answer to this question, we defer to the agencies' reasonable interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.893" offset="928956">Five factors show that the agencies' interpretation is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.691" offset="944212">First, the agencies interpretation preserves the rule for the EPA's performance standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.770" offset="968453">That standard continues to apply to the discharge of water from the lake into the downstream creek.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.929" offset="989142">Second, the agencies' interpretation does not permit discharges to avoid performance standards by characterizing small amounts of solid waste as fill material.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.575" offset="1027699">Third, the agencies' interpretation allows the Corps of Engineers to determine what is best for the aquatic environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.093" offset="1053821">Here, for example, the Corps determined that the slurry discharge though harming the lake in the short-term will be better for the environment in the long-term than with the alternative of permanent loss of wetlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.311" offset="1098648">Fourth, the agencies agreed that no toxic pollutants maybe discharged as fill material.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.223" offset="1118292">And fifth, SEACC has not offered an alternative interpretation that harmonizes the statute and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.815" offset="1144728">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and these cases are remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.618" offset="1167924">Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.826" offset="1180776">Justice Scalia has not filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.992" offset="1197390">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion which Justices Stevens and Souter have joined.</text>
