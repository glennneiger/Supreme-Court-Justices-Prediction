            <text syncTime="75.262" offset="406507">And the statute in 924 requires that the use of the firearm be during and in relation to the underlying crime of violence, which in this case is a bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.236" offset="450393">And we believe that the proper reading of the statute would require that the discharge also be done during and in relation to the underlying crime of violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.861" offset="604829">And so I think that the Court's cases on mens rea and so forth would continue to apply, even given the way that the -- that it's phrased in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.119" offset="13033890">This Court in U.S. Gypsum was very clear when it said that far more than the simple omission of the appropriate phrase of a statutory definition is necessary to justify dispensing with the intent requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.664" offset="13104107">And our argument is simply this: Merely because this might be a sentencing enhancement, rather than an element of the offense, this Court never said that the normal rules of statutory construction cease to apply under those circumstances, which means that the mens rea presumption is appropriate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.577" offset="13187699">And just like this Court said in the passage I just cited, if Congress wants to dispense with that requirement, they must do so clearly, and they simply did not do that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.033" offset="13229599">If they wanted to do that, they could insert the words "intentionally" or "unintentionally discharge", in which case that would be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.539" offset="13259588">And that simply is not the way this statute reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.158" offset="13270037">The best reading of the statute, I believe, and this is what Your Honor was headed toward, is to read the discharge to require during and in relation to.</text>
