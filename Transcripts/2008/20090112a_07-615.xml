            <text syncTime="12.541" offset="157675">Mr. Chief Justice, good morning and may it please the Court: At the heart of this appeal is a matter of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.272" offset="184529">Respondent received $2.3 million in public funds under the Victims Protection and Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.158" offset="220056">TRIA provides, and this is at the blue brief, page 11a, that a party electing to receive such funds must relinquish rights with respect to enforcement against property that is at issue in claims against the United States before an international tribunal or that is the subject of awards by such tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.853" offset="302916">The property in question here is the Cubic judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.336" offset="316813">Respondent renounced rights to attach the Cubic judgment because in case B/61 before the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal at the Hague the United States has demanded that any awards Iran receives in its claim against the United States be set off by the amount of the Cubic judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.719" offset="394344">This can only occur if the Cubic judgment is released from Respondent's lien and is remitted to Iran's Ministry of Defense.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="80.186" offset="428199">Well, they could have agreed that they have a bank account somewhere and any amounts would be set off by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.010" offset="447530">That wouldn't make that bank account at issue with respect to their claim.</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Bederman</label>
            <text syncTime="89.088" offset="463830">No, in that scenario I agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that that would not be implicated, because I think the clear import of the statutory language here that Congress is trying to achieve is that being at issue -- as you'll notice, the statutory provision in 201(c) is disjunctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.488" offset="533420">It refers to claims against the United States -- at issue in claims against the United States before an international tribunal, or that is the subject of an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.450" offset="565290">So I think the disjunctive character of the statute might indicate that the at-issue prong includes a broader set of property than would be indicated possibly by the "subject of an award".</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="125.385" offset="608967">So it doesn't matter that Iran recognizes that this would be used to set off a judgment it might obtain, because you just said, well they could -- a bank account could be used to set it off and that's not sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.255" offset="656509">Well, the mutual -- let me be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.882" offset="662988">The mutual position of Iran and the United States before the Claims Tribunal is that the Cubic judgment, because it's related to a claim within the tribunal's jurisdiction -- and I think that's a key limiting principle here.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.466" offset="709381">The United States would not be entitled to set off amounts in bank accounts that are attributable to other parties or other aspects that are not implicated in claims or defenses before the tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.526" offset="753580">So clearly an examination of the tribunal's jurisdiction and the relevant claims or defenses that are before the tribunal is relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.384" offset="785032">Petitioner is not espousing a position before this Court that any inchoate property located anywhere in the world would be blanketed with immunity under this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.645" offset="822021">It's not necessary to reach that conclusion in order to find for Petitioner here.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.158" offset="836127">The United States at some stage told the tribunal in The Hague that the Cubic judgment -- and now I'm quoting --</text>
            <text syncTime="190.093" offset="867892">"has nothing to do with matters before the international tribunal. "</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Bederman</label>
            <text syncTime="197.779" offset="898612">Yes, that is the language used by the United States in a memorial before the tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.824" offset="922749">The United States has also indicated, and this is clear in the gray brief at pages 81 in note 32 and the gray brief at pages 83 to 85, and in the lodgment, that if -- if Iran receives an award in case B/61 it must be offset or set off, or "recouped" is sometimes the language used in the correspondence between the two governments before the tribunal, by the amount of the Cubic judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.265" offset="1020552">I won't speak for the United States position before the tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.248" offset="1032464">The United States is here to do that, of course, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.373" offset="1040927">But the only way I can interpret that remark is to indicate that obviously before the tribunal is the issue of the United States' obligations to Iran under the Algiers Accords.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.618" offset="1081992">The Cubic judgment deals, of course, with the private disposition of the contractual relationship between Iran's Ministry of Defense and the Cubic military contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.535" offset="1129639">Now Respondents take the position that these two make the matters unrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.441" offset="1149283">But if you review carefully the tribunal's jurisdiction as encompassing both claims and counterclaims, and according to the Algiers Accords in the claims settlement declaration, counterclaims include that which arises out of the same contract, transaction or occurrence that constitutes the subject matter of the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.755" offset="1262446">The United States did not file a formal counterclaim in case B/61, but it has made a demand for a setoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.287" offset="1288568">And within the tribunal rules, a setoff can be the subject of notice under Rule 19-3 or an amendment or certainly comes under waiver of objection provision in Rule 30.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.374" offset="2368993">In fact, there has been a resolution by Cubic Defense Systems and Iran's Ministry of Defense and as soon as the Court renders its judgment in this case, that matter will finally move to disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.493" offset="2421447">It is a bit odd that the underlying issue of Cubic's objections to the district court's enforcement of the International Chamber of Commerce or ICC arbitral award has pended for so long.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.394" offset="2469094">I would have thought, logically, it would have made more sense to have disposed of those issues and then allow the disposition of the liens to be resolved by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.502" offset="2509427">Essentially, it is Cubic's appeal challenging aspects of the district court's enforcement under the New York convention of the ICC arbitral award.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.293" offset="2548611">I think to the extent that there is a counterclaim it's simply that there were some bases for support of the judgment which Iran's Ministry of Defense would have put forward in addition to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.366" offset="2596885">That's what I understand in terms of the ruling of Judge Brewster originally in the district court on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.520" offset="2621544">So, yes, it is unfortunate that the underlying validity of the Cubic judgment still remains open as a matter of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.315" offset="2652682">But again to return to your point, Justice Ginsburg, in Cases 815 and 821 before the tribunal this question of what would be the implications, financial and otherwise, for the United States being found by the tribunal to be in breach of the Algiers Accords because of the failure of not allowing the export of Iranian property or repatriation of Iranian property to the United States has been explicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.864" offset="2754873">And, in fact, in already one instance the tribunal has found the United States to be in breach of Algiers Accords obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.784" offset="2778593">So again, I can't speak for what a ruling in the tribunal would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.814" offset="2790713">All I can suggest is certainly the Iranian position before the tribunal would be that in the instance that if Mr. Elahi or any other lienor were successful in attaching the Cubic judgment that in such a situation it should not be credited as a setoff under these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.264" offset="3928503">This is essentially Judge Fisher's analysis in the dissent below.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.543" offset="3941669">As he indicated, that -- that -- where property has been identified to the Tribunal -- and certainly the Cubic judgment and the proceedings that have occurred in the Federal district court in -- in Southern California and now the Ninth Circuit and now here have been identified to the Tribunal in mutual representations and undertakings by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.036" offset="4023589">Where this property has been identified to the Tribunal as being related to a claim or defense within the Tribunal's jurisdiction -- and I think that is the key limiting principle here.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.091" offset="4055876">That's -- there is a criticism that an expansive reading of TRIA's 2, paragraph 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.472" offset="4169352">And then the second prong is that the availability of that property affects the relief that can be granted by the Tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.422" offset="4197146">And, again, we are not hypothesizing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.390" offset="4204983">The Tribunal has already indicated in cases like Owens Corning, Futura Trading and Computer Services, that when you have a situation avoiding a double recovery, that a setoff derived from collateral proceedings, even absent privity of contract with the sovereign seeking adjustment and with respect to different causes of action, a setoff is still appropriate within the Tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.412" offset="4301113">So it's both an avoidance of a -- of a double-recovery rule and also a notion that a -- a certain offset is -- is related as within the -- the jurisdiction of the tribunal as arising again from the same contract transaction or occurrence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="2053.547" offset="8321672">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the previous 25 or so minutes has demonstrated one sort of overarching fact, which is that there is an enormous risk, if this Court decides to interpret the language of this statute broadly, that it will easily sweep beyond any kind of arrangements between Iran and the United States in ways that fundamentally, obviously, disadvantage the very people that Congress clearly intended to benefit by this entire statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.110" offset="8439954">This is a scheme that was designed to provide remedies, recoveries, to the victims of terrorism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.297" offset="8464614">And somehow in the scheme of everything that was discussed in the first 25 or so minutes of this argument, the victims of terrorism are completely shunted aside on basic -- on the basis of very technical ways of reading it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.088" offset="8507768">But if we go back to the language of the statute, which is in the Petitioner's brief at 11a, it talks about</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.057" offset="8535667">"enforcement against property that is at issue in claims against the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.428" offset="8553221">So the notion that we would focus on the word "property", as it relates to the tribunal and that the tribunal has in front of it, is a natural consequence of the language of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.064" offset="8599719">And to me, at least, the best way to look at the logic is to review how often the United States has described and Iran has described what was the property at issue before the claims tribunal and the B/61 proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.135" offset="8660010">And this is at 65a of the joint -- of the government's brief:</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.667" offset="8678087">"The property at issue consists of one air combat maneuvering range system and all necessary subparts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.711" offset="8702328">There is no dispute that the property was within the jurisdiction of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2210.670" offset="8950178">The first one is remember precisely what the arbitration award is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.057" offset="8967732">The arbitration award is not the value of the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.072" offset="8979749">That was asked for; that was rejected by the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.493" offset="8989466">The arbitration award is for the value of a separate contract between Cubic and the Canadian government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.006" offset="9023530">You will recall in the award, specifically the arbitrator said with respect to the underlying ACMR contract with Iran, that was mutually walked away from by both parties, and then there was a separate agreement that was entered into between the parties, and that was the basis for the arbitration award saying the value of breach of that secondary agreement is the part that serves as the arbitral award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.996" offset="9127497">That it seems to me ought to be regarded at a minimum as one step too far removed, because that's not the property that is at issue before the claims tribunal in any way that the parties are disputing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.366" offset="9172950">They accept that number.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.462" offset="12621322">--Justice Breyer, I think the Hague cases are the place to look in terms of trying to understand this, because what it's what -- Hague, that line of cases all involve efforts to seize consular properties of Iran and all arose prior to the Accords, and every one of those courts of appeals has concluded that each of those properties is beyond the ability of the courts to attach all of those properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.032" offset="12711602">And -- and it seems to me that what Congress was concerned about was having inconsistent claims potentially arise in both the district -- in federal court in the United States and in front of the claims tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.809" offset="12758727">So where you have a situation where the claims tribunal says, look, that's a consular property that belongs to the Iranian government, you should return it, and have the United States have to show up in front of that tribunal and say, oh, excuse me, but unfortunately, we have been forced to sell that property under a federal court order and the embarrassment that arises from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.177" offset="12836153">That seems to me so clearly what Congress had in mind, or at least is clearly covered by this and the case law or all the case law up to this point that has dealt with it has consistently ruled in favor of the United States and Iran in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.497" offset="12893414">But there is no reason to go beyond that context in order to deprive the clear victims of terrorism of a meaningful remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.932" offset="12935210">And I think, Justice Breyer, just to be clear about this, we got money back, to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.916" offset="12955167">A substantial portion of the money we got back came from the values of the properties that the United States seized from Iran that they've used, they have leased out embassies and stuff like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.658" offset="13002083">And that is not property that comes out of the United States' fisc.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.329" offset="13012741">So it's not reasonable to assume, as the government does, that simply because these moneys were paid out, that there is some huge relinquishment that is required there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.670" offset="13046178">It seems to me that it makes much more sense for this Court to narrowly construe this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.606" offset="13065927">I guess the last thing I would say in that regard is, that insofar as we can tell, this case will affect one party -- actually, I guess the other two lienholders behind us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.931" offset="13103229">But realistically, there are no cases in the pipeline.</text>

            <text syncTime="3516.480" offset="14173414">The claims tribunal was created in '81.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.508" offset="14181460">It's not a lot of that property around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.491" offset="14189401">We're talking 25 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.726" offset="14198387">So, they have pretty much played out their course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.366" offset="14208940">There were the Hague noted cases, and the Elahi case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.968" offset="14263380">And certainly, the only interest the United States has at this stage in this litigation is its own financial interest.</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Bederman</label>
            <text syncTime="3553.354" offset="14320849">If I can make just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.384" offset="14332970">In response to Respondent counsel's assertion that in the International Chamber of Commerce arbitral award there's been so form of novation here, which makes the connection between the ACMR and the Cubic judgment somehow attenuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.267" offset="14392529">I think that's belied by the tribunal's -- the panel's discussion, this is at the joint appendix at page 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.874" offset="14418965">The panel makes very clear that under the sales contract credit has to be given to Iran for its advance payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.855" offset="14446864">Here you have a breakout of the salvage value of the ACMR.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.321" offset="14468702">All that the panel was indicating was that Iran was not entitled to specific performance here, to make that ruling is not a finding of a novation in the sense which would respond to counsel using that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.736" offset="14522410">So, I don't see the attenuation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.361" offset="14528888">Speaking to the assertion that, again, the enormous risk presented by this case of the broad construction of the congressional intent, I think if you look carefully at the language at the blue brief at 11a of the statutory construction provision -- that was part of the colloquy between the Chief Justice and Respondent's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.573" offset="14609763">And if you read this, it completely reserves, if not begs the question of whether the Cubic judgment is, quote, an asset otherwise available under the section for attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.456" offset="14665247">So, I think it completely doesn't answer, one way or the other -- a finger on the scale, as Respondent's counsel has evocably said, or some form of command by Congress to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.404" offset="14713104">It simply reserves that question for the Court's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.388" offset="14728986">In response to Justice Ginsburg's last question to Respondent's counsel, the one thing I would point out to you again, is another clue in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.914" offset="14759079">If we look at the Victims Protection Act, which was the predecessor statute here, section 2002(c), what Congress wanted to protect is the right of the United States to, quote, pursue these subrogated rights as claims or offsets of the United States in appropriate ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.860" offset="14830864">So, again, Congress has contemplated the notion that there will be a process of setoffs either before the Iran U.S. claims tribunal or in some other context, which I'm not sure I can imagine beyond what response counsel has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.715" offset="14886348">So, to suggest that the broad remedial thrust of TRIA, which Petitioner is not denying -- it's not our place to deny that -- is nonetheless tempered by these carefully crafted provisions in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.633" offset="14942041">We would support, obviously, reversal of the lower court's opinion.</text>
