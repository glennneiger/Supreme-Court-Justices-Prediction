            <text syncTime="7.843" offset="136819">In April 2000, Diana Levine sought treatment for a migraine headache at her local health center.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.565" offset="171719">A clinician gave her a direct injection of Phenergan, an antinausea drug manufactured by Wyeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.977" offset="205364">After the drug entered her artery, Levine developed gangrene and doctors amputated her forearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.072" offset="237756">Levine brought a state law damages action alleging that Wyeth had failed to provide an adequate warning about the risk of directly injecting Phenergan into a patient's vein.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.435" offset="291150">The Vermont jury found that Levine's injury would have not occurred if Phenergan's label included an adequate warning and had awarded her damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.317" offset="334723">Wyeth then sought a judgment notwithstanding the verdict arguing that Levine's claims were preempted by federal law because Phenergan's labeling had been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.550" offset="391670">The trial court rejected Wyeth's presumption argument and the Vermont Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.961" offset="417270">We granted certiorari to consider Wyeth's argument that the FDA's approval of Phenergan's label preempts Levine's state law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.054" offset="457603">We now affirm the judgment of the Vermont Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.442" offset="475157">We reject Wyeth's argument that it is impossible for it to comply with both the state law duties underlying Levine's claims and its federal labeling duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.571" offset="523745">Generally, a manufacturer may only change its drug label after receiving the FDA's approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.784" offset="552584">But the agency has a regulation that permits manufacturers to make certain unilateral labeling changes to enhance drug safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.136" offset="589991">Under this regulation, Wyeth could have added a stronger warning about direct injection of Phenergan and thereby complied with both its state law and federal law duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.558" offset="639624">We also reject Wyeth's argument that Levine's state law claims posed an obstacle to Congress' purpose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.152" offset="689988">The history of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act shows that Congress did not intend to preempt state law failure to warn actions and Wyeth's reliance under a preamble to a 2006 FDA regulation is unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.068" offset="761668">This preamble is not an agency regulation with the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.056" offset="781625">And Congress has not expressly authorized the FDA to preempt state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.931" offset="805136">We do not defer to the FDA's mere assertion that state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.789" offset="840558">Among other problems, the 2006 preamble does not sufficiently explain FDA's departure from its longstanding position that state law is a complementary form of federal -- of drug regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.788" offset="904610">We therefore hold the FDA's approval of Phenergan's labeling does not preempt Levine's state law failure to warn claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.022" offset="941495">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.260" offset="958422">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia have joined.</text>
