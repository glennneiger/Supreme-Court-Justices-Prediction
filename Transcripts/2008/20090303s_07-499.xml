            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="28">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in case 07-499, Negusie versus Holder.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="8.193" offset="32733">This case arises under the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.946" offset="47780">It concerns a provision of the Act that is commonly called the persecutor bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.115" offset="68469">With certain simplifications under the Act, an alien who is deportable can seek refugee status here if he has shown a well-founded fear of prosecution in his country once he's been returned to it, but the alien is not eligible for refugee status if before coming here, he himself assisted or otherwise participated in other acts of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.271" offset="161047">The persecution must be on account of certain protected characteristics such as of raise, religion, or national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.798" offset="191140">If the alien engaged in those acts, the so-called persecutor bar in the statute prevents him from getting the refugee status.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.900" offset="215590">This alien, Daniel Girmai Negusie, is the petitioner in this case when the petitioner sought refugee status, he found himself disqualified by reason of the persecutor bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.697" offset="254774">He countered that he'd been forced or coerced to assist in the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.910" offset="275568">We granted certiorari to consider whether the prosecutor bar applies if an alien has been forced or coerced in prosecuting others.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.356" offset="305452">Petitioner is a dual national of Eritrea and Ethiopia.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.245" offset="320916">He was conscripted into the Eritrea in military in the 1990s.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.376" offset="341501">When the petitioner refused to file against Ethiopia, his other native, he was incarcerated and persecuted in Eritrea.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.110" offset="372430">The Eritrean Government then forced him to work as an armed guard in a prison where individuals were persecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.924" offset="399701">The immigration judge found that the petitioner had not shot at or directly prosecuted the inmates, but the petitioner did guard them at gunpoint and forced them to remain in the hand sand which he knew was a form of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.958" offset="443796">The petitioner escaped and fled to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.907" offset="455604">Here, he applied for the refugee status in the form of asylum and withholding of removal based on the persecution he suffered in Eritrea.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.959" offset="491861">The immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit all concluded that the persecutor bar does apply even if the petitioner's assistance in persecution was coerced or otherwise, the product of duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.591" offset="554346">The petitioner argues that the statutory text, the structure, and the history make clear that involuntary acts do not implicate the persecutor bar and the Government on the other hand argues that Congress explicitly spoke to the contrary by not including a duress exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.620" offset="622474">Because there is substance to both contentions, we find that the statute has an ambiguity that the agency should address in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.480" offset="649850">In deciding this case and in ruling against the petitioner, the agency and the Court of Appeals relied on a case from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.377" offset="677435">That case was Fedorenko versus United States decided in 1981, but Fedorenko arose under a different statute than the one we consider here and the Fedorenko's statute was enacted for a different purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.071" offset="732292">We now conclude it was error to treat the result or the reasoning Fedorenko is controlling the interpretation of the prosecutor bar at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.712" offset="766774">A review of the agency's prior decisions on point reveals that the agency has erroneously felt itself bound by our decision of Fedorenko and thus, believed it had no discretion to exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.390" offset="809510">Having concluded that the agency has not yet exercised its Chevron discretion, we see no reason to depart from the ordinary remand rule that is well-established and no administrative law precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.931" offset="847649">Here, the agency can bring in its expertise to bear on the matter and so doing it can through informed discussion and analysis help a court later determine whether the agency's interpretation exceeds the leeway the law provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.423" offset="897700">We thus remand to the agency for consideration of the question in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.515" offset="918075">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.909" offset="931659">The case is remanded for further proceedings consisted with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.574" offset="946288">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Alito has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.995" offset="963946">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Justice Breyer has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.632" offset="986516">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
