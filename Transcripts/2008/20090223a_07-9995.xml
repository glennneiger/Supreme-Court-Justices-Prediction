            <text syncTime="7.404" offset="136067">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Petitioner lawfully exercised a peremptory challenge on juror Delores Gomez.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.510" offset="172534">As a result of the erroneous denial of that challenge, Ms. Gomez wrongfully sat on the jury and lacked authority to render a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.381" offset="211926">Petitioner's conviction should be reversed automatically for three separate and independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.885" offset="245990">First, the trial before an unlawful adjudicator is structural error.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.272" offset="263544">Two, the wrongful seating of a juror is structural error, because the effect of the error is impossible to determine--</text>

            <text syncTime="51.662" offset="313072">The -- the category of structural error has been kept very narrow by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.566" offset="336687">And it seems to me that a juror who is perfectly qualified, who is conceded -- it is conceded could not have been dismissed for cause, is quite a different matter than a judge who -- who has taken a bribe or who has a monetary stake in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.099" offset="426862">It -- it seems quite a stretch to apply those decisions to -- to the case of a juror who was qualified, and it was just a judge who was overexuberant in denying a peremptory challenge.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.166" offset="531143">A -- a juror who is illegally on the jury, who does not have the authority to serve, would render the jury improperly constituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.891" offset="582029">Therefore, there would be structural error for a jury illegally constituted to render a judgment irrespective of bias.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.380" offset="623929">But your whole argument that the -- that the juror was illegally sitting and the jury was illegally constituted is a -- in effect a statement of the effect of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.237" offset="671368">And the State supreme court doesn't think that's the effect under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.272" offset="691534">So it seems to me that the -- the whole premise of your argument that there is something inherently unlawful about the seating of that juror is simply in -- in effect denied by the State supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.782" offset="753601">And we take our law from them.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.638" offset="784948">Petitioner had a lawful right to excuse juror Gomez under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 434.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.626" offset="912948">That's -- that's your -- your unstated premise, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="205.561" offset="928726">The -- our argument is very narrow in scope: That if a -- a juror that is illegally constituted renders a verdict of guilty, then that jury is an unlawful adjudicator.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.570" offset="988703">The unlawful adjudicator claim is what triggers the right to due process.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="225.307" offset="1007720">There could be a thousand reasons why under State law a particular jury is improperly constituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.228" offset="1031335">So you are saying whenever the State under whatever State laws it has says that the judge made a mistake about who to put on the jury, that that violates the Federal Constitution.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="241.401" offset="1072086">Just as an example, to follow up on Justice Breyer's question -- and then can you answer his question -- many States have rules that you have to be a resident of the county to serve on that jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.959" offset="1114300">And suppose a juror thinks he or she is a resident and gets the county line wrong or doesn't know what the residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.195" offset="1139273">Under your rule -- what is your term, an "unlawful adjudicator".</text>
            <text syncTime="262.349" offset="1155887">And then we have a -- we have a -- a Federal constitutional standard that requires structural error for any State -- for any violation of any State -- State rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.674" offset="1213147">That is Justice Breyer's question.</text>

            <label>Mr. James K. Leven</label>
            <text syncTime="277.776" offset="1217536">Well, with respect to jury qualifications such as age and citizenship, there is a very delicate screening process that goes into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.982" offset="1254421">So the problem of an unlawful adjudicator with respect to, say, age would be a very, very rare phenomenon and would rarely occur, because jurors who are too young to serve, perhaps under 18 years old, would never make their way to the jury pool in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.593" offset="1324847">So it would really be a very rare situation--</text>

            <text syncTime="307.128" offset="1334983">Well, you are -- you are avoiding the question by saying, oh, don't worry, there are not going to be many violations of this sort, and then you pick out age.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.615" offset="1360896">But Justice Breyer began -- the preface to his question was -- was that there are -- are manifold requirements varying from State to State.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="354.959" offset="1526303">Well, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="355.659" offset="1529125">One qualification is a jury -- a juror can't be prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.609" offset="1636854">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.529" offset="1548560">I think it's a very common thing for prosecutors and defense lawyers to get into arguments about whether a particular juror is or is not prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.969" offset="1582310">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.219" offset="1587325">So sometimes the judge excuses them, maybe five million times a year; and probably in a certain percentage, maybe 5,000 or 500 or 50,000, the judge is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.894" offset="1641974">So the State appellate court says he's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.794" offset="1649601">So the jury wasn't made up properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.596" offset="1660782">Now you are saying in every one of those cases that violates the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.584" offset="1676769">I have never heard of this before.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.900" offset="1681993">It may be there is some precedent for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1726.725" offset="7013376">Justice Scalia, the briefs before the Illinois Supreme Court raise two independent grounds for automatic reversal by Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.379" offset="7039916">One was a pure State law automatic reversal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.664" offset="7053082">The other was a due process violation that would then trigger Federal automatic reversal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.151" offset="7075025">What the Illinois Supreme Court did explicitly is say, even if there were a due process violation here, we believe as a matter of Federal law that would not trigger automatic reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.924" offset="7118179">What's certainly implied, because several of the questions today have suggested, what is implied is that if the court had believed that as a matter of Illinois law there were an automatic reversal rule required, that this was an unlawful juror to the extended so profound that it voided the judgment and required a new trial, under those circumstances the court would never have had to reach that assumption, much less go into any of the analysis it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.372" offset="7207936">So here the court was faced with both claims, rejected both, but to reach the Federal claim they must first show a due process violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.819" offset="8533703">First, in context with the briefs, which independently sought both State and Federal remand, and page 171 of the joint appendix, where the court makes clear that we are simply not going to resolve the question of whether there is a Federal due process violation, I think in context it does become clear what the court has done here is it has certainly concluded there is not a State right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.047" offset="8614682">So it's proceeded to say, well, what if there is a Federal due process entitlement?</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.267" offset="8627534">If that is the case, let's proceed and decide, well, it's harmless anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2138.105" offset="8658881">Now, I will say that if the Court harbors concerns -- if the Court were to conclude there is no due process violation here, but harbors concerns that the Illinois Supreme Court feels itself duty-bound to follow this Court's jurisprudence on the question of harmlessness, that at that point the Court could simply make the due process ruling and remand and allow the Illinois Supreme Court to make clear what I think is already clear, but make crystal clear, that they would apply a -- a harmless error standard to this sort -- this sort of deprivation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2212.219" offset="8955319">Indeed, the court suggests there probably isn't by early on in the opinion pointing out that this Court has long held since -- since Stilson in 1919, has long held that there is no due process entitlement to a peremptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.027" offset="8998578">So I think in context it is quite clear that what the court has done is it said, there is nothing in here for you under Illinois law; under Federal law, even if there were a due process violation, it is simply not -- it is simply harmless error.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.363" offset="11303936">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Federal law does not require automatic reversal of Petitioner's conviction because the denial of a peremptory challenge at most violated only his State law rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.355" offset="11355867">And even if his Federal constitutional rights had been violated, harmless error review would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.557" offset="11376661">The Constitution does not give criminal defendants the right to peremptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.878" offset="11397977">Therefore, a -- the right of a State defendant like Petitioner to exercise peremptory challenges derives entirely from State law, and when the erroneous denial of a peremptory challenge deprives him only of State law right, and when the State law rights alone have been violated, State law, not Federal law, dictates whether harmless error review applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.494" offset="11488465">The violation of a State law right doesn't rise to a due process -- Federal due process violation unless it deprives the defendant of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.182" offset="11527126">And this Court has repeatedly held that States can withhold peremptory challenges entirely without impairing the right to an impartial jury or a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.740" offset="11569445">It therefore follows that the erroneous denial of a single peremptory challenge does not render a trial fundamentally unfair.</text>
