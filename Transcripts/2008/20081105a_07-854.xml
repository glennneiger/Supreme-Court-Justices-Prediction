            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">We'll hear argument next this morning in Case 07-854, Van De Kamp v. Goldstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.737" offset="133350">Mr. Coates.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_t_coates" startTime="8.487" stopTime="135.587">
            <label>Mr. Timothy T. Coates</label>
            <text syncTime="8.487" offset="140351">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case arises from a Ninth Circuit opinion that essentially creates an exception to absolute prosecutorial immunity for chief advocates and supervising advocates.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.080" offset="190715">The court's decision in the Ninth Circuit essentially held that prosecutorial policies that apply to an entire body of cases in a trial office do not qualify for absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.554" offset="240661">We submit that this is inconsistent with this Court's decision in Imbler v. Pachtman and its progeny, applying the functional approach to absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.427" offset="276187">There is essentially no distinction between a chief advocate or supervising prosecutor implementing a policy directing that cases be handled in a particular manner and that particular chief advocate or supervising advocate actually participating in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.770" offset="341494">Because of the size of the prosecutorial agencies, it's not feasible that a chief advocate or supervisor can be in a courtroom in every single case.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.275" offset="371587">But they can put their prosecutorial stamp on each case through the implementation of policy, through training, or through other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.148" offset="407009">Here the policy at issue concerns compliance with the obligation to disclose exculpatory information under Brady v. Maryland and also Giglio v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.956" offset="450267">In Imbler versus Pachtman, the Court recognized that those obligations are core prosecutorial obligations that are part of the prosecution's intimate relationship to the fairness of the trial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.914" offset="502094">And we submit that that duty, that function, is the same whether it's performed in the courtroom or whether it's performed by a chief advocate or supervising advocate in terms of formulating policy or when making particular policy decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.839" offset="557787">Imbler recognized that these core decisions had to be insulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.160" offset="579103">Otherwise, it would spawn litigation that would burden the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.945" offset="598225">And it might cause them to hesitate to produce particular exculpatory information.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.516" offset="620481">It might create a burden of having them involved in more lawsuits than actually performing their function and prosecuting the criminal law.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="135.587" offset="648798">Was -- was there an element in Imbler of the fact that you have to make tactical and strategic decisions at -- at the moment that are difficult, that call for judgment that has to be exercised on the spur of the moment?</text>
            <text syncTime="157.302" offset="735629">This is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.018" offset="742525">This is -- this is a long-term commitment or a long-term policy that the Respondents are arguing for.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.308" offset="775649">It seems to me somewhat different than the dynamics that inform the Imbler decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy T. Coates</label>
            <text syncTime="173.878" offset="801980">Well, the court in Imbler did mention a time frame in which decisions have to be made -- quickly made by individual prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.966" offset="826326">It also noted the sheer number of decisions that are often made in the context of a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.852" offset="845866">I would say, with respect to chief advocates and -- and supervisors, the number of those types of decisions is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.273" offset="871570">They have the same complexity in determining what is going to come up in every single case as an individual prosecutor does in a -- in a single case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.029" offset="898529">Moreover, there is a multitude more that they have to consider because they are considering the possibility of its impact on thousands of cases within the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.683" offset="929144">I will note, though, in Butz v. Economou, where the Court extended absolute immunity to individuals prosecuting agency actions, that same point was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.139" offset="966969">But some of the conduct there was a bit more drawn-out in terms of the investigative manner -- not the investigative manner, but the -- the prosecutorial process used by the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.478" offset="1000406">And the court didn't find that -- that longer time frame to be dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.930" offset="1014199">Going back to Imbler, it again looked at what the basic function was in the administrative agency proceeding and found, yes, it is akin to prosecutorial conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.036" offset="1050561">May I ask you kind of perhaps a farfetched hypothetical question just so I get the case law in mind?</text>
            <text syncTime="242.190" offset="1075221">Supposing a prosecutor wanted to develop a policy which would keep -- which would create a bifurcated regime within the office where the people who interrogate prisoners are entirely separate from the people who prosecute trials, so that they don't have the malicious purpose that your adversary says is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.667" offset="1153066">And supposing the prosecutor then hired some expert layman who had no trial experience at all to develop such a program, and the program, itself, is desirable from the prosecution's point of view but -- but presumably unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.994" offset="1210431">Would the person who developed that program be entitled to immunity--</text>

            <text syncTime="295.574" offset="1288694">The Court has noted in some of the judicial immunity cases that sometimes court clerks can perform functions that are essentially judicial functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.311" offset="1315652">In that case, though, under the Court's jurisprudence with private actors, they might have only qualified immunity, the private actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.334" offset="1343760">But the decision to use them would be prosecutorial.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.441" offset="2216249">But I think our point is that -- that if you buy their theory of a constitutional claim, whatever constitutional claim that is is a -- a prosecutorial function-related claim, because that's the nature of the Giglio and Brady obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.498" offset="2272465">They are trial obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.701" offset="2389285">They could accomplish the same thing, I suppose, by every time a case is filed sending out an e-mail saying: Comply with our policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.450" offset="2484266">Reading the Monell allegations of the complaint against the County of Los Angeles, I think that that is what it is, that the deputy -- that the district attorney rather, acts as a county officer and would be the policymaker for those policies and customs and practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.876" offset="2545915">That obviously is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.995" offset="2558454">Petitioners are being sued as individuals for their acts as supervisors and as the chief advocate in formulating a particular policy concerning compliance with Brady and Giglio.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.350" offset="2599832">These sort of cases, opening this door particularly for the broad claim that plaintiffs are now trying to assert, which is this kind of notion of information management, can spawn all sorts of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.091" offset="2646852">Virtually any time that you can't reach the individual trial attorney, all you need do is attribute whatever you think that person did to the failure to develop a policy or provide training or to have adequate data management to allow them to do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.185" offset="2703172">This kind of end-run under Imbler will create the multitude of litigation and drag chief advocates in, as well as supervising advocates, that Imbler was designed to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.558" offset="2744654">And it has the worse collateral effect that it's also going to end up pulling in the individual attorneys, the individual trial attorneys in a given case, because maybe they don't have individual liability, but they are certainly going to come in; they are going to testify as witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.033" offset="2798571">So, it's the worst of both worlds, which is you are burdening the chief advocate with this sort of litigation which may impact the way they formulate policy, and you are burdening the individual line deputy attorney, and that's the attorney that Imbler sought to protect as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.912" offset="2862101">Those adverse consequences on the judicial process are what led this Court in Imbler to recognize the importance of absolute immunity for prosecutors.</text>

            <text syncTime="787.908" offset="3258117">It is violated only when the Government has suppressed material exculpatory evidence, that is, evidence that can undermine the fairness of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.931" offset="3294166">It's intimately linked in a way that really nothing else in the adversary system is to preserving the fairness of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.787" offset="3325618">It's an obligation on the prosecutor to go beyond the normal role of an advocate to zealously advocate for his cause, and it puts the advocate in the position of supplying the judicial system with information needed to be submitted in order to have a fair proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.373" offset="4283894">--I think the flaw in Respondent's theory is the attempt to bifurcate what the prosecutor is doing into an administrative function and a prosecutorial function.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.103" offset="4366858">I think the problem with that is illustrated by a hypothetical about judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.924" offset="4386189">Suppose -- judges of course have immunity from sitting on cases, and if a judge sat on a case that involved a conflict of interest he could not be sued or she could not be sued for having done so, even if it violated the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.082" offset="4438747">Suppose that the litigant reformulated the suit and said: Well, the judge should have had a policy to ensure a check of conflicts in all the cases that the judge sat on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.504" offset="4476468">And that would have been an administrative duty, set up some notebook that has all the judge's investments and direct some underling to ensure that no party in any case has an interest where the judge has an investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.245" offset="4523384">That was purely administrative, so we ought to be able to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.578" offset="4532788">The judge for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.613" offset="4536863">And I think that obviously should fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.649" offset="4549089">It would end-run all of the policy reasons for being able to assert absolute judicial immunity; and I think that that is identical in form to what the Respondents are trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.438" offset="4592243">They are trying to divorce the role of the office in maintaining some sort of a system to ensure that information is available to prosecutors to disclose under Giglio from the obligation under Giglio to ensure the fairness of the judicial process, which is an obligation that falls uniquely on the prosecutor and which Imbler makes clear is subject to absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.636" offset="4685030">And you just can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.905" offset="4690045">If you do that, you end up exposing the supervisory prosecutors to evils that cannot occur to the line prosecutor himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.428" offset="4724109">And it produces anomalies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.178" offset="4731110">The line prosecutor, even if he intentionally violates Giglio, cannot be sued, but under Respondent's theory the supervisory prosecutor, even if what he did is no more than deliberately indifferent or perhaps even negligent, could be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.938" offset="4790147">The line prosecutor who handles a certain number of cases cannot be sued, in part because it would ensure a distraction of the duties of the prosecutor and would divert him from performing his role of enforcing the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.161" offset="4843123">The supervisor, who is responsible for far more cases and is subject to far more disappointed litigants who would like to sue him, that person can be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.136" offset="4887009">And it would have an even more disruptive effect on an office if supervisory prosecutors, who have the responsibility, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, of trying to come up with policies that will prevent constitutional violations, and that will ensure that the office functions in an efficient and an effective manner, they will be the ones who are most deterred -- most deterred from acting, because they will suffer the possibility of thinking of their own individual liability rather than focusing on what they are supposed to do, the public interest, both disclosing information that needs to be disclosed, bringing suits that need to be brought, and using witnesses regardless of fears that someone later on is going to discover information that should have been disclosed and sue the supervisor, saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.332" offset="5063805">"We know we can't sue the individual prosecutor, but you, supervisor, failed to develop effective policies to get that information to the court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.586" offset="5096824">That kind of circumvention of Imbler plays no role of fulfilling the policies that absolute prosecutorial immunity is designed to fulfill.</text>

            <text syncTime="1277.290" offset="5215629">We could stipulate that this chief D.A. would be immune from those sorts of suits and it would not affect our case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.646" offset="5253036">This case is about the function of deciding on an officewide basis whether to track important historical facts and disseminate them internally within an office to employees who need to know those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.172" offset="5311133">This case is about gathering and preserving information, certain categories of raw data, that may or may not ever get into the courtroom, not about how to use those specific pieces of data once you actually have a prosecution materializing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1491.329" offset="6071714">It was intentional or with deliberate indifference, so the allegation is, the intention was to cut the flow of information to the line prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.017" offset="6110480">And the reason that's different is because while Petitioners say compliance with Brady, our answer is compliance with Brady comprises at least two functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.408" offset="6160112">There is the front line function of the prosecutor, the advocate, making the decision,</text>

            <text syncTime="2284.822" offset="9245696">If you look at the bottom of page 45, about seven lines up from the bottom, you see two distinct kind of subtheories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.047" offset="9286656">The first is -- so it starts -- the line starts purposely or with a deliberate indifference -- theory 1-A, that petitioners failed to create any system for the deputy district attorneys handling criminal cases to access information, about informants, of course.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.727" offset="9373383">"that they failed to train deputy district attorneys to disseminate information pertaining to the benefits provided to jailhouse informants. "</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy T. Coates</label>
            <text syncTime="3080.600" offset="12428873">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.167" offset="12435143">I think some of the Court's comments have underscored the tension in this case that the nature of the constitutional claim here: That the rights that were actually violated are the Giglio and Brady rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.544" offset="12484671">But the function we are talking about is the function of complying with Brady and Giglio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.912" offset="12502120">You can do it in various fashions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.431" offset="12508181">Maybe it's a data base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.548" offset="12512674">Maybe it's something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.264" offset="12515495">Maybe in some cases it's even foreclosing particular witnesses from testifying because you don't trust them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.502" offset="12536498">That is essentially what the district attorney's policy is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.120" offset="12550917">It -- it forecloses deputy district attorneys from just, willy-nilly, using jailhouse informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.893" offset="12577980">They have severe restrictions on what they can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.126" offset="12586966">It's hard to imagine a -- a policy that is more directed to courtroom behavior than something that's caveating the discretion of a particular line prosecutor as to which witnesses they can use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.967" offset="12634300">I think what we have here is a constitutional claim that the tighter they try and draw not just the causation, but the nature of the obligation itself is tied to the prosecutorial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.358" offset="12679858">Because it's part of the prosecutorial function to assure the disclosure of exculpatory information under Brady and -- and Giglio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.864" offset="12709951">And so I would submit that under Imbler this Court has already held that that conduct by an individual prosecutor falls squarely within immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.302" offset="12743701">And I submit that there is -- there is simply no distinction for that kind of conduct when it's done in the courtroom and that kind of conduct when it's done in advance in all cases by a supervising prosecutor or by a chief advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.444" offset="12792184">If the Court has no further questions--</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="3174.396" offset="12803992">I suppose the distinction he's trying to make maybe -- I'm not sure I've got it right, but you see there are certain kinds of systems that maybe administratively an office ought to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.287" offset="12859580">And where it turns out that this is really an administrative system, a lot of offices do have it, some don't, but where it was negligent not to have it and the very presence of it would have prevented the -- the individual in the courtroom from behaving the way he did, well, that's a separate kind of a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.467" offset="12936276">That's an administrative claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.117" offset="12942963">Just as if, for example, suppose you had no secretary or assistants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.187" offset="12959159">He says, look, everybody should have secretarial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.806" offset="12977654">And if only you had secretarial assistance, these people would not have misread everything the way they did or would have gotten the phone calls or would have done something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.429" offset="13016210">That's the kind of line -- so he's trying to draw a line there between something that is pretty purely administrative and -- and something that is really supervisory and training.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.219" offset="13055289">And he is not saying supervisory and training.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.985" offset="13062395">He is saying that was a separate claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.681" offset="13137209">They have information systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.699" offset="13149226">They existed, and every office ought to have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.784" offset="13157585">And now he says I might lose on that claim; but, nonetheless, it's not the kind of claim that falls within Imbler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.288" offset="13183603">I think that's his point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.473" offset="13196351">--I think that is -- that is the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.675" offset="13209098">But I think our point is that trying to characterize that as an administrative system strips it of the -- the meaning for which you are collecting the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.947" offset="13246192">I mean, according to them, the reason we have the obligation is because of the prosecutorial obligation under Giglio and Brady to make sure that exculpatory information gets out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.219" offset="13279316">So it's -- it's not just administrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.938" offset="13294153">And I -- I assume if you look at the Ninth Circuit decision -- and I -- and one of the main focuses of the Ninth Circuit's decision in the case was not so much that it was merely administerial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.877" offset="13329993">It kind of reached that conclusion on this notion that decisions about all cases are different than decisions about a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.864" offset="13357892">And I think our point is that, in looking at the -- at the function performed here, you can't make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.268" offset="13379521">That it really -- there really isn't a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.554" offset="13388612">That if you are making a decision for all cases, then you are making a decision for that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.522" offset="13408569">There is no difference from making a policy in advance and saying everybody has to follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.409" offset="13424034">And then, as I mentioned before, the criminal complaint is filed, and you send out an e-mail saying comply with Brady, or this is how you comply with Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.313" offset="13451724">There is no real difference there.</text>
