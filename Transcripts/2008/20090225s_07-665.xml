            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.524" offset="42033">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari from the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.545" offset="58124">Petitioner, Pleasant Grove City, owns and displays a number of monuments and other objects in Pioneer Park, Utah including a Ten Commandments monument.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.439" offset="101697">In 2003, respondent, Summum, a religious group asked the city to erect a stone monument displaying its Seven Aphorisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.524" offset="138059">The petitioner denied the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.767" offset="147045">In 2005, the respondent sued the City and various officials arguing that because the city had accepted the Ten Commandments monument to Free Speech -- Speech Clause of the First Amendment compels the city to display the Seven Aphorisms monument as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.300" offset="213187">The District Court denied respondent's request for a preliminary injunction ordering the city to erect respondent's monument.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.566" offset="242235">The Court of Appeals reversed and held that the city was required to accept the monument because of public park is a traditional public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.051" offset="276195">We conclude that although a park is a traditional public forum for speeches and other transitory expressive acts, the display of a permanent monument in a public park is not a form of expression to which form analysis supplies, instead, the placement of a permanent monument in a public park is best viewed as a form of government speech and is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the Free Speech Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.365" offset="381416">For this reason and other set out in an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reverse the decision of the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.434" offset="405762">The judgment of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.295" offset="413181">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Ginsburg has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.308" offset="433243">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.364" offset="453409">Justice Souter has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
