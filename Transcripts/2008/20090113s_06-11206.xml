            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="16.504" offset="65961">Deondery Chambers, who was the petitioner in this case, was convicted of a -- of a gun crime being a felon in possession of a gun illegally to a federal crime and there's an Act called the Armed Career Criminal Act which says that a person who is convicted of that, if he has three prior convictions for certain drug crimes or violent felonies, will get a mandatory minimum of 15 years sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.403" offset="165540">Now, the question here is you look back at the three prior convictions, so he has several prior convictions, and this case turns on whether one of those prior convictions which is contested as to whether it's a violent felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.964" offset="219875">Is it a violent felony or isn't it a violent felony?</text>
            <text syncTime="58.254" offset="233040">And the particular conviction in question is in fact has to do with his punishment for another conviction, so he has a quite a few convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.881" offset="267522">But this particular time, he's convicted of a state crime and he was sentence to weekends in prison and he didn't show up for four of the weekends and so they convicted him of that, of failing to report for prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.739" offset="326977">And the question is, is that crime, a failing to report for prison, a violent felony within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="90.060" offset="360204">But there are several definitions here but the one that significantly matters here is the following, is a violent felony if the conviction is for a crime that it is burglary, arson or extorsion involves the use of explosives or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.801" offset="447140">We can get rid of the few of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.915" offset="451633">It's not burglary, it's not arson, not extorsion, it doesn't involve the use of explosives.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.171" offset="468665">But the question is, does it present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another?</text>
            <text syncTime="123.591" offset="494369">Now, the lower courts thought it did but I think, we think, that the reason they thought that is because they lumped it together with a general crime called escape because all these things escape from prisons, escape from custody, failure to report for prison, failure to report for home confinement, the variety of things are all contained in the same subsection of a single Illinois provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.783" offset="591127">Well that -- that is so, but nonetheless, we think that several of these cover separate crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.010" offset="615995">And in particular escape is one crime for purposes of this sentencing thing and a failure to report is another crime and we just look at that failure to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.650" offset="666568">And once we look at that, we think it's not that difficult, we treat it as a crime differently from escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.036" offset="700110">And when we asked the question, does the failure to report involved conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.468" offset="733860">We think the answer has to be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.055" offset="744204">The conducted issue is more likely to consist of just inaction, not action.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.740" offset="766983">There is no convincing evidence that these kinds of people who don't report for prison, even when they're apprehended, are more dangerous than other suspects who were on the loose.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.180" offset="808675">And indeed here, the United States Sentencing Commission studied the subject prepare to report and their report, they identified every federal case in 2006 and 2007 that was sentence under a particular provision called escape, instigating or assisting escape and they took those where there was a pre-sentence reports so you could find out what really happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.412" offset="909612">They looked at 414 cases that fell into this particular category and a 160 of them involved failures to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.848" offset="947332">So, among other things, they said, well, let's look at those failures to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.074" offset="960289">Did any of them involve violence?</text>
            <text syncTime="242.018" offset="968021">And the answer was no, not one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.291" offset="977112">They didn't involve violence during the commission of the offense even they failed to report, nor did they involve violence when he was later apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.326" offset="1017236">And the Government has provided some information as the contrary but not very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.706" offset="1034790">So, we conclude there is no risk here, not a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.191" offset="1056733">We hold that and we reverse the determination of the Court of Appeals which was to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.721" offset="1082856">Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
