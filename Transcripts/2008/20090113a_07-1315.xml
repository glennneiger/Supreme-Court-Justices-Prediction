            <text syncTime="9.189" offset="143172">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under the deferential review required by the AEDPA, Mr. Mirzayance was not entitled to Federal habeas corpus relief on his ineffective counsel claim because the State court adjudication of that claim was not contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, the clearly established Strickland test.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.519" offset="228540">And because the Strickland rule is a general one, the California Supreme Court had wide latitude in resolving that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.773" offset="257588">In this case, the Ninth Circuit applied something different from Strickland, finding that Wager was duty-bound to present a State law affirmative defense because no other defenses were said to be available at that time and because it merely might have worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.968" offset="326343">But even the Ninth Circuit conceded that this Court has never announced such a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.122" offset="346927">And as in--</text>

            <text syncTime="62.622" offset="356958">At some point during the oral argument, and perhaps at the beginning because it is the beginning inquiry -- when there is an evidentiary hearing, how does the standard for the court of appeals differ than when there has been no evidentiary hearing?</text>

            <text syncTime="81.201" offset="431250">--Well, I think it depends on whether the Federal habeas court is doing a section 2254(d) analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.439" offset="464165">The fact is that section 2254(d), for example, doesn't speak to denying a claim on the merits, even if it's unexhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.847" offset="509827">So, in theory, a Federal habeas court could perhaps accept new evidence that the State court never had before it in order to deny relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.166" offset="731136">Because if the State court made a reasonable adjudication of the merits of the claim based on the State court record, then even holding a hearing wouldn't make any difference because relief would still be precluded under 2254(d).</text>

            <text syncTime="180.882" offset="829983">And you -- and you've thought about this, and obviously the problem is, since the California appellate courts didn't see the hearing, this is an artificial exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.756" offset="873451">So you know the problem.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven E. Mercer</label>
            <text syncTime="192.289" offset="875645">Well, I think, again, the only question that matters is the 2254(d) question that says that relief shall not be granted unless that State court adjudication, based on the State court record presented, was unreasonable, and here's why.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.507" offset="984524">And if the State court did not grant an evidentiary hearing, I guess you could say that that was contrary to established Supreme Court law, couldn't you?</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="233.666" offset="1041157">But unless -- unless there is a Supreme Court requirement that there be an evidentiary hearing, I don't see how holding an evidentiary hearing could show that the State court decision, which was legitimately held without an evidentiary hearing, was contrary to our opinions.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.918" offset="1150140">And the reason here is simple: That it is unfair to find that the State courts made an unreasonable application of law based on facts that they didn't have.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.798" offset="1333624">It's our position that, frankly, this was a straightforward, routine Strickland case that was uncomplicated, properly adjudicated by the district court when they first reached it in 2001 without a hearing, and that the Ninth Circuit has come at this matter with a -- a chest full of monkey wrenches in the sense that they should not have ordered the evidentiary hearing in the first place, and then when they did, they should not have disregarded the very fact-finding that they ordered be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.222" offset="2087309">So what should have happened in this case we contend is what the district court first did when confronted with the claim in 2001.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.142" offset="2118969">And that is you assess the facts and claims as presented to the State court and then decide whether it would be reasonable to reject the claim under either prong of Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.683" offset="2165154">And as this Court said in Strickland itself, the easiest and most direct way to answer that question is through the prejudice prong here.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.356" offset="2299841">Before the killing itself, he closed the curtains and waited till he was alone with the victim before entering her room with a gun in his pocket and the silent weapon drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.712" offset="2341324">He struck with the silent weapon, delivering fatal blows, resorting to the gun only when she screamed and struggled, and then immediately collected the shell casings, turned off the lights, collected the knife, went back to his apartment where he showered, disposed of the bloody clothes, concocted a false alibi message on the machine -- excuse me -- and then, overcome with guilt at the wrongfulness of his conduct, he calls his friend and says: "I messed up big-time".</text>
            <text syncTime="593.818" offset="2481758">And that's at page 120 of the State reporter's transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.670" offset="2493147">And then, further acknowledging both the legal and moral wrongfulness of his actions, he turns himself in to the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.208" offset="13171273">Well, California statute under Penal Code section 28 prohibits their opinion on premeditation and deliberation at the guilt phase where the issue is premeditation and deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.079" offset="13214741">So I can't understand how a court would let in their opinions on premeditation and deliberation when there's a totally separate issue of insanity at the insanity phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.156" offset="13267090">It's -- if it's irrelevant or prohibited at the guilt phase where premeditation is the issue, it's surely going to be irrelevant at the NGI phase where it's not an issue, and we have a totally different standard.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven E. Mercer</label>
            <text syncTime="3429.314" offset="13823707">Just a couple of points I'd like to make briefly to clarify a couple things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.050" offset="13846695">First off, there was no finding that Attorney Wager misunderstood California law or somehow was under the impression that a finding of first-degree murder was legally precluded a finding of NGI.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.691" offset="13897164">He argued at the State trial that there's no question that an insane person can deliberate, and surely while the jury's verdict was devastating under the facts of this case, he didn't close up his books and go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.785" offset="13953588">He told the trial judge, we need to reassess this, I need to decide who I'm going to call, I need to consult with my doctors and my co-counsel and decide what we're going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.891" offset="13990055">And as the district court found here, and as Wager stated in the State court declaration, there was no final decision made until the morning of trial when the parents expressed a profound reluctance to assist their son.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.785" offset="14061631">And this was, in fact, his first NGI defense, but as Mirzayance's family attorney stated in his State court declaration, Attorney Wager was a 10-year expert on mental health and sanity issues with the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.080" offset="14134774">He had tried more than a hundred trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.699" offset="14145223">He was the expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.049" offset="14150656">He had done his homework here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.634" offset="14157030">He knew what he had to -- to present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.602" offset="14168837">He did not make a rash decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.287" offset="14179600">He consulted with co-counsel, and concluded reasonably under his professional valuation that the defense could not meet its affirmative burden of proof here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.893" offset="14213977">The second thing I would like to clarify on Justice Ginsburg's point, there was some sentencing discretion left here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.999" offset="14246473">It's correct that Wager in hindsight said, well, perhaps there was nothing to lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.701" offset="14265281">But he argued to the sentencing judge the very fact that his client knew the wrongfulness of his actions and was so remorseful should entitle him to a lesser sentence on the weapons enhancement.</text>
