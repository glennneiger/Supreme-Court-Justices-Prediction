            <text syncTime="8.137" offset="138992">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Failure to report is not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act because it presents neither a serious potential risk of injury to others nor involves violent and aggressive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.080" offset="198760">The Government argues that failure to report satisfies both the risk of injury and violent, aggressive conduct standards for the same reason: The prospect that a offender will violently resist an arrest -- resist arrest upon completion of the offense or upon -- for having done the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.707" offset="273262">That potential and that potential risk alone is neither as a matter of fact nor law sufficient to satisfy either the risk of injury or the violent, aggressive conduct standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.229" offset="319342">Beginning with the risk of injury: The statute refers to a serious potential risk of injury, and by using the word "serious" Congress indicated not just any felony, not just any felony which carries necessarily some risk of injury would be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.654" offset="381095">The risk that must be generated must be one that's somehow greater than, something that warrants singly out this sort of offender as the sort of person who's deserving of greater punishment for his recidivism.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.752" offset="469494">I think that in fact one of the critical errors that the courts of appeals have made and that the Government made here is equating breakout, prison escape, with failure to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.810" offset="513693">They are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.910" offset="518081">They are importantly different, both again as a matter of analytically the categorical rule and what would you look at to determine whether this sort of person satisfied the violent and aggressive standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.700" offset="565206">And we now know, in light of the Sentencing Commission's report that was filed just last -- that was filed with the Court just last week, that the risk of injury associated with a prison breakout escape and failure to report is dramatically different.</text>

            <text syncTime="891.130" offset="3670956">In fact, in all the materials that have been submitted to this Court, there is not a single cited instance or case of an innocent bystander or a police officer who has been injured in connection with a confrontation from arrest for failure to report.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.084" offset="3794777">There is nothing in the record that would give us any reason to believe this is the kind of special violent conduct that Congress was singling out for special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.107" offset="3834901">I should also add that excluding failure to report from the statute isn't going to create any kind of crack through which the sort of people the Government appears to be concerned about might fall through.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.033" offset="3886623">And the reason it this.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.299" offset="3891639">The several anecdotal cases they cite in their brief and a couple of the cases that Massachusetts reported back to them which had involved some kind of violent resisting arrest, those individuals were charged, separately charged for assault and battery and similar crimes on a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.959" offset="3954228">It's unsurprising that when that happens, those individuals will be separately charged and convicted for their violent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.732" offset="3981396">So the only work that is done by sweeping away the categorical rule, doing serious damage to the categorical rule, undermining Begay, the only work that's done is to encompass people who we have reason to believe didn't engage in violent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.507" offset="4048478">That seems to me a strange way to interpret the statute, certainly not the sort of things this Court would want to close its eyes to.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.094" offset="4082855">It's important to preserve the distinction in Begay between the violent and aggressive standard on the one hand and the risk of injury on the other hand, and Government's approach collapses them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.552" offset="4124651">The Government says, why is this violent and aggressive?</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.318" offset="4135727">Because in their view we can -- falsely, as we've discussed, but because in their view there is a sufficient risk of injury on arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2485.177" offset="10047133">But even if you go and set that aside and don't draw that categorical line, and you look at, well, what's the risk of violence, here what you've got is you've got you know that they are going to come after him; he knows they are coming; he is already deliberately, he has already indicated his unwillingness to submit to custody; they know that; so they come prepared for resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.543" offset="10136576">And in Illinois he is by definition a recidivist felon if he has committed this crime, and those are characteristics that are particularly indicative of dangerousness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.808" offset="10777725">One -- one possible problem that could arise from a holding that offenses like failure to report are not violent felonies is that a statute that broadly covered escape, the result would be that jail break escapes would not be violent felonies under that statute, because the statistics that are out there suggest that 89 percent of all escapes are either walkaways or failure to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.327" offset="10895799">And so unless the charging document specifically charged it as a jail break escape, then the general -- something that was charged under the general escape statute would not qualify for coverage under the ACCA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.215" offset="11019306">Just to begin with where Mr. Roberts left off, most states in fact do distinguish in their statutes between failure to report and prison break escapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.671" offset="11061102">These are cited by both parties in the briefs and you can review them, but there are clear distinctions in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.725" offset="11081373">So the risk that prison break escape is somehow going to escape -- escape, if you will, from the scope of the statute as a result of a reversal is -- is unfounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.914" offset="11118049">Just to make a couple of things clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.783" offset="11129543">First of all with respect to the sentence, Justice Ginsburg, the -- he was sentenced to six additional months but it was stayed as -- as was mentioned; and so when I was answering that question he did not serve additional time as a result of that, and that's what I was referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.225" offset="11191296">If you look at the sentencing transcript, that's where the indication is that he did in fact serve out four additional weekends.</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.729" offset="11829311">And indeed even the dangerous weapon findings of the sentencing commission, I think, should be excluded, because under the guidelines, the mere possession of a weapon is not a violent felony.</text>
