            <text syncTime="10.681" offset="148104">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case involves a challenge to the efforts of the Federal Communications Commission to carry out its statutory mandate under 18 U.S.C. 1464, and more even-handedly address indecent material that is broadcast directly into the home during the time of day when children are likely to be in the viewing audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.157" offset="238070">After reconsidering its policy in this area, the Commission determined that an enforcement action may be appropriate in the case of indecent language that is isolated as well as repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.808" offset="288643">Because the Commission provided a reasoned explanation for that change in course, the court of appeals erred in invalidating its action under the Administrative Procedures Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="60.443" offset="347157">In the first order, I would -- I would have gathered that it had, but its second order said basically, we've never had a policy that single use of these expletives is okay.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.653" offset="428032">They did change the policy, Justice Scalia, and the Commission directly acknowledged that in paragraph 12 of the Golden Globe Awards order, which is not reprinted in the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.148" offset="477978">In that paragraph, the Commission said,</text>
            <text syncTime="95.757" offset="488427">"We now depart from cases holding that isolated or fleeting use of the F-Word was not indecent. "</text>

            <text syncTime="102.176" offset="514132">The latest order, the one that's up here, says that all of the statements to that effect in the past were simply staff statements and that the Commission had never held to that effect before.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.856" offset="572855">Well, the court of appeals recognized, and we think correctly so, that the Commission did change its position on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.460" offset="595216">The Commission had never brought an enforcement action against a broadcaster for the isolated use of an expletive, and the Commission made clear in the orders it issued in this case, beginning with the Golden Globe Awards order and the particular omnibus and remand orders before this Court, that it was taking a change in regulatory course in determining that it was appropriate to bring an enforcement action where there was an isolated incident of an expletive if the context suggested that it would be indecent in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.927" offset="769087">Well, the court recognized, but it seems to me the FCC -- and this is what Justice Scalia's questions go in part to -- in the remand order at first it said its policy hadn't changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.859" offset="816839">But if you go to the heart of where the FCC grappled with this, paragraph -- paragraph 12 of the Golden Globe Awards order, it specifically disavowed its prior decisions in which it had said that isolated expletives would not warrant an enforcement action under 1464, and it specifically said,</text>
            <text syncTime="195.649" offset="887996">"we are departing from our policy. "</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="199.100" offset="901789">But I think it rewrote that in its last order, and I think it even explained away the Golden Globe statement by saying it was not as categorical as it might appear.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.362" offset="938883">--I think if you look at maybe pages 82 to 83 of the petition appendix here, where we discuss that as well, I think it made clear with respect to the indecency finding involving the 2003 Billboard Music Awards and the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, that in applying its contextual analysis in the past it focused on whether or not expletives were repeated or dwelled upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.318" offset="1038670">In this case, the Commission determined that it was not going to be guided exclusively by that consideration and that it was going to take into account all contextual factors, including the explicit and graphic nature of the language used.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.819" offset="1336675">I mean, isn't that how this whole thing arose?</text>
            <text syncTime="310.022" offset="1345557">The case was in the Second Circuit and the Commission said it wanted to have an opportunity to explain its position more fully?</text>

            <text syncTime="318.378" offset="1378889">--It is, and it did in the remand order reprinted in the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.954" offset="1393204">Mr. Chief Justice, I think either way the ultimate standard is arbitrary and capriciousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.860" offset="1412848">Now, the Respondents have focused on whether or not we have complied with the criteria that the Court has looked to in determining whether or not a change in agency position is arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.044" offset="1457570">And we think that there are three factors here that must lead to the conclusion that it was not arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.839" offset="1480767">One, we think that the Commission did directly acknowledge its change in position.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.100" offset="1497799">Two, the Commission provided a concrete explanation for that change.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.397" offset="1515039">And, three, that explanation is at a minimum plausible and consistent with the Commission's statutory mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.660" offset="1540012">This Court has never invalidated a change in agency position where those three factors have been present.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.361" offset="1562896">And if you look at the three principal justifications that the agency used in explaining its change in position, I think it's absolutely clear that this was at a minimum a rational policy choice that the agency was committed -- was permitted to take under the Administrative Procedures Act.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="381.855" stopTime="425.209">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="381.855" offset="1632799">One of the problems is that, seeing it in operation, there seems to be no rhyme or reason for some of the decisions that the Commission has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.674" offset="1688074">I mean, the "Saving Private Ryan" case was filled with expletives, and yet the film about jazz history, the words were considered a violation of the Commission's policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.824" offset="1756724">So that there seems to be very little rhyme or reason to when the Commission says that one of these words is okay and when it says it isn't.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_g_garre" startTime="425.209" stopTime="494.933">
            <label>Mr. Gen Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="425.209" offset="1806252">Well, we do think, of course, that there is rhyme or reason to its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.100" offset="1821821">First, let me say that much of the vagueness type of arguments that the Respondents are making similar to your question could be made equally with respect to the Commission's policy with respect to repeated utterances as well as isolated utterances.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.359" offset="1874902">If you take the "Saving Private Ryan" and the blues documentary example, those were repeatedutterances cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.874" offset="1896950">We are here because they challenged the Commission's change in policy to go from repeated utterances to consider enforcement actions in the case of isolated expletives where they met its contextual analysis and where it was explicit, graphic, shocking or pandering in the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.556" offset="1963614">Now, I think certainly there are going to be situations and this Court has indicated that the vagueness inquiry doesn't turn about coming up with hypotheticals at -- at the outer margins of the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.220" offset="2006350">I think in the Pacifica case our reading of the Court's decision is similar to the D.C. Circuit's reading of that decision in the Action for Children's Television case, that implicit in the Court's decision in Pacifica was that it rejected a vagueness challenge to the Commission's definition of "indecency", which is the same definition that the Commission is applying today.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.053" offset="2277606">The Commission has exercised restraint in that area, recognizing that there are different values at stake than in the -- in the utterance of indecent language during a prime-time broadcast where are a substantial number of children in the viewing audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.111" offset="2325880">For the broadcast in this case, up to 24 to 28 percent of the viewing audience comprised children under the age of 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.559" offset="2355660">This language was concededly gratuitous in the context it was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.932" offset="2377185">In the Nicole Richey example in 2003, there was an element of pandering as part of the dialogue consisted of Paris Hilton saying, FCC reasonably determined, was shocking and gratuitous and explicit and graphic; and, therefore, in the context in which it was presented, indecent under the agency's longstanding definition of "indecency".</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.888" offset="13612972">You seem to be suggesting that since there is a criminal penalty for a violation of this statute, the agency has no role in -- in defining what -- what the terms of the statute mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.370" offset="13666889">Justice Scalia, the language of the statute itself would suggest that, because the statute says that the Commission may find violate -- may impose certain enforcement actions for people who violate section 1464.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.830" offset="13728747">That, of course, is a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.608" offset="13735852">Therefore, it is not a statute that has been delegated to the agency's broad discretion to decide what falls within that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.811" offset="13764692">It is within the agency's discretion to choose a penalty that, in fact, enforces that criminal dictate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.463" offset="13791232">And to go back to Justice Stevens's position -- I shouldn't give it as your position, it is my position -- but the point, I think, we were discussing, if you have a choice of two ways to read indecency, you have to read it in a way more favorable to the defendant, that precludes the approach that the government has taken in this particular case.</text>
