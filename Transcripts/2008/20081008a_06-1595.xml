            <text syncTime="26.650" offset="212052">It is protected first by the first clause of section 704(a), which is known as the opposition clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.291" offset="4082563">We think this case is best resolved under the opposition clause, and that clause does not require employees to utter magic words of opposition or to initiate the interview in which they express opposition to unlawful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.134" offset="4137942">Rather, the clause is satisfied when a reasonable person would understand that the employee has objected to sexual harassment in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.739" offset="4168349">And when an employee discloses or reports that she has been subject to unlawful sexual harassment, a reasonable person could certainly infer that the employee opposes a practice made unlawful by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1047.792" offset="4296558">So if she hasn't complained to the EEOC within the relevant time, she wouldn't have a cause of action for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.112" offset="4321844">But once she has retaliated -- an adverse action is taken against her because of what she has reported, then she has timing requirements on when she has to sue for the retaliation, and she did that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.836" offset="4364790">And this is a case where the Sixth Circuit tossed the case out on summary judgment, and it erred in doing so because the facts alleged in this case were more than ample to survive summary judgment on the question of whether she opposed what the Director of Employee Relations did to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.096" offset="4425812">She alleged that in the context of a sexual harassment investigation in which she was asked to disclose inappropriate behavior by the director, she reported repeated instances of offensive, objectionable, and unwelcome conduct by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.487" offset="4479415">For instance, she said that she had her head pulled into his lap and that in response she threw him out of the office, thereby indicating that she did not like this conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.190" offset="13746197">But I'd like to address briefly the participation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.709" offset="13756228">The participation clause does have the singular value, as Justice Alito suggested, that it is evenhanded, that it will protect witnesses for both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.648" offset="13787993">And the integrity of the process is certainly strengthened if both witnesses, witnesses on both sides, know they're protected from retaliation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.586" offset="13823728">Is the only question -- the participation is not in doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.490" offset="13847343">But the question is under this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.923" offset="13853090">That language its certainly broad enough, as Justice Souter suggested, to encompass the sort of process that's at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.179" offset="13890184">As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this Court's decisions in Faragher virtually mandate these decisions.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3453.285" offset="13918605">You think the language "investigation under this title" is the equivalent of</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.670" offset="13940130">"investigation with respect to an alleged offense under this title? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.641" offset="13959983">That doesn't strike me as self-evident at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.359" offset="13974821">It seems to me "investigation under this title" to me means an investigation under this title, which is not an investigation by the employer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="3475.864" offset="14008884">--I think the words under this title are elastic enough to support either meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.749" offset="14028424">The context of the statute and the way this Court has repeatedly construed it give meaning to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.884" offset="14049008">In response to the concern that the Chief Justice raised, Faragher and Ellerth are not the only decisions that provide an incentive for these investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.473" offset="14079310">The Court's decision in Kolstad makes the existence of this sort of process essential to avoid awards of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.711" offset="14108254">So even in non-harassment cases that same incentive has been created by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.115" offset="14129883">In a situation involving harassment, the contours of the investigation are fact largely shaped by Federal law, not only policy guidance which the EEOC has issued helping employers figure out what to do, but a large and growing body of case law under Faragher and Ellerth elucidating what those requirements are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.826" offset="14208773">Particularly importantly here, the victims of sexual harassment are virtually required by the court to use these processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.050" offset="14249629">Ms. Crawford had to speak up at some point or she had had no claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.686" offset="14268123">And last, as a practical matter, if sexual harassment is going to be stopped, it's mostly going to happen through these internal processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.244" offset="14310442">By the time most of these controversies about sexual harassment get to the EEOC or the courts, the victims have left their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.249" offset="14346386">In this Court's decision in Pollard, the individual had been fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.867" offset="14368852">In Souter she had been driven from her job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.617" offset="14375852">In Faragher and Ellerth and Harris, those victims had quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.187" offset="14394138">If you look at the array of lower court decisions involving sexual harassment, by the time a case gets to the Commission in most of those cases the victim has given up and left.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.376" offset="14438964">So it's exceptionally important that these processes be effective and evenhanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.697" offset="14464251">No further questions.</text>
