            <text syncTime="9.262" offset="143485">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The 1997 amendments to IDEA prohibit tuition reimbursement awards for students who are unilaterally placed in private school without first having received special education services from the public school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.733" offset="213389">This is so under ordinary principles of statutory construction and particularly so under the Spending Clause clear notice rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.571" offset="244736">Prior to 1997, IDEA did not expressly address tuition reimbursement for unilaterally placed students.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.243" offset="275456">In 1997, Congress added section 1412(a)(10)(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="48.731" offset="301369">In subsection (i), Congress provided that when the school district makes a free appropriate public education available, a FAPE, no reimbursement is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.170" offset="339090">And then in subsections (ii) through (iv), Congress addressed situations where courts and hearing officers may award tuition reimbursement and said that reimbursement may be allowed where the school district does not make a FAPE available to a student who previously received special education services from the public district.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.150" offset="527067">But that "if" -- if the agency made a free appropriate public education -- and here, as I understand it, the school district said that this child was ineligible for special education.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.730" offset="929353">Congress instead went on in (C)(ii) through (C)(iv) to address very specifically, in the context of a comprehensive statutory scheme, when tuition reimbursement would be available to students who did not previously receive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.032" offset="13846591">I'd like to address the two provisions that we have heard today for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.519" offset="13868534">T.A. and the government are resting their argument that tuition reimbursement is permitted in the unilateral placement context to students who had not previous received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.561" offset="13908658">The regulation 300.148 -- counsel referenced subsection (b), Disagreements about FAPE, and it does say that the hearing officer can consider the question of financial reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.301" offset="13963619">And the very next subsection, (c), is entitled Reimbursement for Private School Placement, and that provision speaks only to students who previously received special education and related services under the authority of a public agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3483.948" offset="14042196">It's not in any of the addendums, but I -- I would direct the Court's attention to subsection (c) of 300.148.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.638" offset="14073020">In terms of the -- the provision that T.A.'s lawyer addressed, 1415(b)(6), no argument -- there's no argument in the briefs that 1415(b)(6) gives hearing officers the authority to grant tuition reimbursement in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.532" offset="14152537">The Department of Education did not rely on this provision when articulating its commentary that tuition reimbursement is still permitted under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.407" offset="14196109">The Secretary of Education relied upon the 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.311" offset="14215649">That of course, refers only to courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.411" offset="14224112">And even if the argument were properly presented, which it isn't, it would be subject to the same dynamic that's in play with respect to 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.403" offset="14280014">You have a very general provision giving hearing officers authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.557" offset="14296628">Congress got specific in 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.842" offset="14309794">There's a heading -- enacted a provision under the heading Reimbursement for Private School Placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.830" offset="14341768">I think that clearly indicates that's where Congress intended to repose the authority of hearing officers to order tuition reimbursement to unilaterally placed children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.554" offset="14388684">We also have the -- and -- and it just doesn't work to say that 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) somehow gives hearing officers authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.897" offset="14438003">Even if it were interpreted that way prior to 1997, in 1997 Congress enacted the statute that expressly referenced hearing officers and courts, and allowed both of them to give tuition reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.538" offset="14496622">So even if 1415 were interpreted prior to '97 -- incorrectly, we would submit -- to give hearing officers that authority, after 1997 where Congress actually went to the trouble of saying hearing officers and courts can give tuition reimbursement in certain circumstances, that -- that prior interpretation, whatever its merits back then, no longer is valid--</text>

            <text syncTime="3627.426" offset="14616158">I mean, they see an unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.128" offset="14626920">The parents were justified, and it doesn't say there are no circumstances other than -- where you couldn't -- where they may not pay.</text>
