            <text syncTime="1421.304" offset="5790657">They spend the rest of the time on the high seas or in other ports either unloading oil or in dry dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.375" offset="5814899">And, therefore, everybody agrees the tax has to be apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.511" offset="5827438">The ordinary way and the way that this Court has approved the apportionment of a tax on physical property -- particular physical property -- is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.415" offset="5859098">You would put in the numerator of the tax the number of days with the number of miles they spent in or number of miles traveled in the taxing jurisdiction; you put in the denominator 365, the total number of miles traveled everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.140" offset="5901939">You multiply that fraction times the value of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.743" offset="6752381">Now let me answer the question that both you and Justice Breyer particularly addressed, which was the oil and -- and gas tax imposed with respect to much of the property in Valdez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.733" offset="6800342">Valdez taxes homes, it taxes oil and gas property, it taxes barges, it taxes cruises, it taxes all sorts of things just like every other jurisdiction does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.358" offset="6846840">The oil and gas tax that you ask about, Justice Kennedy, and you did, too, Justice Breyer, is imposed -- and there's no need to remand back this case to address this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.916" offset="6889054">It's in Section 43.56 of the Alaska Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.320" offset="6910683">The State of Alaska imposes an oil and gas tax on property used in the oil and gas extraction, transportation, et cetera, business, but it also authorizes a city under Section 43.56 and 29.45 -- the City of Valdez may impose that tax as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.268" offset="7006501">It's two mills, it's just like every other tax that's imposed in Valdez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.970" offset="7025309">These are taxes imposed on the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.672" offset="7032101">If the city imposes the tax, which the City of Valdez does, then the tax by the State -- that tax paid to Valdez is a direct credit, dollar-for-dollar credit, for the tax that would otherwise have to go to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.349" offset="7094794">So, in the first place, I think would it make no difference as suggested by your question, Justice Breyer, whether it was the State or the city that imposed the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.073" offset="7133665">The constitutional provision refers to States.</text>
