            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="225510">Well, Your Honor, it's -- it is correct, as this Court observed in Roberts, that the Respondents' agreement that the legal position of the court below is incorrect certainly should provide this Court great comfort in reversing the decision of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.779" offset="285592">And, indeed, a decision on the merits here is important because the Ninth Circuit's decision is harmful to consumers, deterring beneficial price cuts and sufficient partial vertical integration.</text>

            <text syncTime="64.773" offset="365526">The parties' agreement on a point of law does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction in any way, and the parties remain adverse in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.818" offset="437729">Well, you might be right, but, you know, with respect to standing we've held that that is an issue-by-issue inquiry, not a live case broadly conceived.</text>

            <text syncTime="93.959" offset="482241">Well, in Laidlaw the Court said that it was for a particular type of relief that the plaintiff had to establish standing, but that's not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.399" offset="520067">The Respondents continue to pursue a section 2 claim and pursue, evidently, the same type of relief based on the same course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.337" offset="551832">I'd also like to point out that Respondents, while conceding that the position of the Ninth Circuit was incorrect, have not clearly stated that they would not take advantage of a decision by this Court affirming the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.728" offset="605330">And I think that that's important, because there really would be no reason for these Respondents to say that if for whatever reason the Court decided that the Ninth Circuit was right, that they would not go ahead and take advantage of that--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="134.953" offset="646290">I thought they asked to have the Ninth Circuit decision vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.905" offset="658098">They didn't ask us to affirm it.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.024" offset="666561">They said: Vacate that decision; it is wrong.</text>

            <label>Mr. Aaron Panner</label>
            <text syncTime="142.440" offset="676174">--That is right, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that if this Court were to disagree -- if the -- for example, it's well established that the Solicitor General's confession of error, for example, or a State attorney general's confession of error does not bind this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.383" offset="735943">Indeed, a party's position with respect to the proper disposition of a case never binds the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.120" offset="754960">So the Court certainly has the power to say, now that the case is properly before it: We think that the Ninth Circuit got it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.274" offset="783590">Obviously, we don't think that that's what we think the Court should say; but, given that circumstance, if the Court, for whatever reason, were to affirm the Ninth Circuit, there would be nothing that would bar the Respondents from taking advantage of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.182" offset="831133">Even though they have said that that's a legal error, if that were the established law, there would be no reason for them not to pursue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.800" offset="853598">And I think that that's relevant, again, to the question whether the parties remain adverse for Article III purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.805" offset="881706">As a jurisdictional issue, the adversity of the parties with respect even to the section 2 claim, even if they intended to pursue a different legal theory, is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.078" offset="922770">But the point I am making is simply to illustrate that adversity even with respect to the narrow legal issue remains, even though they are not contesting the proper -- the proper disposition of that legal issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.786" offset="1077624">And here we don't have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.904" offset="1090058">We don't have anyone that we have appointed and said: You represent the position.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.492" offset="1124436">--Well, that's true, Your Honor, but there is -- there is amicus arguing before the Court today defending the Ninth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.931" offset="1158186">And there were two amicus briefs filed in support of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.866" offset="1165918">Had those not been filed, of course the Court could have sought additional help.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.235" offset="1183368">But the positions -- the arguments in favor of the Ninth Circuit decision have been put forward in those amicus briefs, and indeed counsel will be arguing in defense of the Ninth Circuit's position today.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.327" offset="1235717">And I think it's -- I think the jurisdictional issue is answered really by your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.498" offset="1260481">That is to say, the fact that the Court can appoint an amicus in this circumstance to defend a judgment shows that this Court retains Article III jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.802" offset="1289634">And it's very important in this case for the Court to reach the merits of the decision and clearly to rule that there is no independent price-squeeze theory under section 2, because recognition of such a theory, as in the Ninth Circuit's decision, is very harmful to consumers because--</text>

            <text syncTime="314.148" offset="1362986">Is there any way in which the resolution of their price-squeeze claim would affect their Brooke Group section 2 claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="327.506" offset="1416485">In their brief, they refer to the possibility that the wholesale price that was charged could be in some way a proxy for cost and this Court clearly stating that there's a -- a different issue as to whether a single economic unit is charging prices below cost, that wholesale prices that may be charged are not an appropriate proxy.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.344" offset="1539783">But I -- and so, in that respect, I think that a clear declaration with respect to what is required -- I guess the distinction between the predatory-pricing theory of liability and a -- and a price-squeeze claim as recognized by the Ninth Circuit could -- could have an impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.693" offset="1637167">Are you arguing there's never a price-squeeze claim under section 2?</text>
            <text syncTime="386.829" offset="1653781">In other words, are you challenging Justice Hand's reasoning in the Alcoa case?</text>

            <text syncTime="397.452" offset="1696204">I think that I would not go so far as to say that there would never be a situation in which a price squeeze, that is, the -- an insufficient margin between wholesale and retail prices to allow a competitor to compete -- that that course of conduct could never support a claim under section 2, but the basis for the claim would have to be that there was a duty to deal -- or a duty to deal under section 2, an antitrust duty to deal, that was effectively being evaded through that sort of pricing conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.744" offset="1849386">--Well, I think that the Alcoa case was wrongly decided, Your Honor, and in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.565" offset="1868716">The critical point about -- the first point about Alcoa is that the conduct that was at issue was said to be unlawful because it was an abuse of the power in the ingot market and not monopolization of the downstream market in sheet.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.110" offset="1942904">And so what -- what Judge Hand said was that that was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.645" offset="1965056">He expressed some doubt about whether it was appropriate to treat it as an independent basis for -- or an independent wrong under section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.668" offset="1993164">But the notion that the abuse -- that charging too high a price at the wholesale level could be an independent section 2 wrong is quite inconsistent with what this Court said in -- in -- most recently in Trinko where it recognized--</text>

            <text syncTime="785.603" offset="3248818">And the fabricators are A-number one out there as possible -- possibilities to break down the monopolist in ingot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.946" offset="6762183">That really isn't, as Mr. Panner said, worth the candle, and it creates the risk of chilling legitimate price cutting, and it puts the courts in the -- in the role, essentially, of being a regulator, maybe not just at one level, but at two.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.697" offset="10653278">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We think the proper disposition of this case is to vacate the decision below and to remand and let the district court decide whether the complaint should be amended or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.873" offset="10705941">Vacating the judgment would amount to a dismissal with prejudice of the price-squeeze claim, and, therefore, this Court would have nothing to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.164" offset="10751080">The Court doesn't need to reach out to decide the vitality of Alcoa, the question of which is not even presented by the question raised in the -- in the cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.120" offset="10790891">And there are many reasons why -- and I am happy to address why -- Alcoa should remain good law, if the Court wishes to get into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.494" offset="10832374">However, we don't think it's necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.113" offset="10842927">On the specific issue here, if the Court decides not to vacate the judgment below and wants to examine the correctness of the Ninth Circuit judgment, the specific issue of whether the absence of a duty to deal thereby dooms any kind of claim -- a price-squeeze claim or really any other type of antitrust claim, including a predatory pricing claim, if the regulators can address the issue, we think that is -- that is the case, that that is the incorrect view of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.671" offset="11001125">And, indeed, to some extent we agree with the Solicitor General that the existence of a regulatory remedy is not sufficient to bar a price-squeeze claim because there is no exhaustion requirement under the antitrust laws, and this Court's decision in Trinko, as the Solicitor General suggested, when it looked at the regulatory remedies, that was with respect to expanding section 2 enforcement and not with respect to traditional antitrust claims, which Alcoa certainly is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.065" offset="11162666">Now, with respect to the issue of the duty to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.802" offset="11193699">What does that mean, that there's no duty to deal?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Brunell</label>
            <text syncTime="3273.453" offset="13200217">--They certainly don't approve the retail pricing, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.405" offset="13212024">The retail pricing in this case is entirely unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.774" offset="13225503">It purports to be in a competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.428" offset="13244207">But let me back up for 1 second.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.396" offset="13252044">The -- the regulatory regime here is quite different from the one in Trinko.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.932" offset="13270120">In -- in Trinko, you had a regulatory duty that essentially required the monopolist to cooperate with its rivals in the monopoly market in order to dismantle the monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.008" offset="13326440">In this case, you have a regulation that's designed to ensure that the monopolist does not extend its monopoly power into unregulated competitive markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.779" offset="13369595">And so the -- surely, the regulators focus -- can focus on the wholesale rates and ensure in this case that the rate that the monopolist charges itself is the same as the rate it charges its rivals and -- with the object of ensuring a competitive downstream market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.181" offset="13471159">But that doesn't mean that that should oust antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.049" offset="13482653">The regulators may, in fact, think that it's important to have antitrust law available to enforce claims in order for them to cut back on their regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.606" offset="13536883">And indeed, in this case, when the -- when AT&amp;T sought to de-tariff its wholesale offering, the regulators referred to the fact that one of the justifications for de-tariffing would be that the antitrust laws would be available in case there were a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.937" offset="13618176">So the -- the relationship between antitrust and regulation is symbiotic and complementary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.626" offset="13649000">And we would suggest that in this case the mere fact that the district court determined that the complaints of insufficient cooperation by the Petitioner in this case did not state a claim for refusal to deal shouldn't preclude a -- a price-squeeze claim any more than it should preclude a predatory pricing claim, which the government and the Petitioners seem to concede would still lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.799" offset="13797689">Now, finally, this point about over-deterrence and whether there's any evidence that any monopolist at any time has ever been deterred from engaging in legitimate retail price-cutting or efficient vertical integration, I would submit that there is absolutely no evidence anywhere in the literature, no empirical evidence, that there is a problem of overdeterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.055" offset="13946692">And had there been a problem over the last 63 years that Alcoa has existed, one would think it wouldn't be too hard to find evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.077" offset="13986712">There is no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.946" offset="13994235">Furthermore, in Brooke Group the Court did not simply rely on the risk of over-deterrence as a basis for holding that above-cost price-cutting was not actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.622" offset="14056929">In Brooke Group it relied on two factors: the fact -- the fear that making above-cost price-cutting illegal would deter legitimate price-cutting, but also the fact that above-cost price-cutting would not eliminate equally efficient rivals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.250" offset="14135400">Any equally efficient rival could meet an above-cost price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.886" offset="14150029">The price-squeeze doctrine, under the transfer price test, protects equally efficient downstream rivals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.759" offset="14189526">So that issue is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.545" offset="14208648">The deterrence issue is -- is quite different when you -- when have a price squeeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.615" offset="14228919">Furthermore, the notion that a monopolist would respond to a price-squeeze complaint -- thank you, Your Honors.</text>

            <label>Mr. Aaron Panner</label>
            <text syncTime="3574.894" offset="14406029">I have two points I'd like to make: First of all, I think -- in agreement with Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy and others, I do think that the presence of a regulatory remedy here is a critical factor arguing in favor of reversal of the Ninth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.260" offset="14495472">The second point that I really want to make is the importance of clear rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.978" offset="14514385">In the antitrust context where we are talking about a system of rules that's going to govern decisionmaking by businesses where most of those decisions are never going to lead to litigation, are never going to come before the courts, it is critically important to have clear rules that avoid deterring harmful -- that avoid deterring beneficial conduct, that avoid having the rules themselves harm consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.511" offset="14608530">I think that was the point that Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg were getting at in the questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.148" offset="14627025">It is critical to adopt a decision on the merits explaining why the Ninth Circuit's price-squeeze decision -- not just here, but in the prior decision, in City of Anaheim -- is incorrect and inconsistent with this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.074" offset="14682718">And, more broadly, it's critical to have a clear rule stating that in the absence of a duty to deal, an allegation of price squeeze -- it doesn't state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.346" offset="14719812">And I think that it's also -- would be very valuable to say that the complaint that was before the district court and the amended complaint, at a minimum as supplying one version of the facts that might try to be elaborated, fail to state a claim under this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.642" offset="14797030">The clear gravamen of that complaint, indeed the explicit gravamen of that complaint, was that the margin between the wholesale price and the retail price was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.365" offset="14839871">And--</text>
