            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="108544">We will hear argument today in Case 08-205, Citizens United v. The Federal Election Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.949" offset="136338">Mr. Olson.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="8.119" offset="140936">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Participation in the political process is the First Amendment's most fundamental guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.256" offset="177507">Yet that freedom is being smothered by one of the most complicated, expensive, and incomprehensible regulatory regimes ever invented by the administrative state.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.235" offset="225468">In the case that you consider today, it is a felony for a small, nonprofit corporation to offer interested viewers a 90-minute political documentary about a candidate for the nation's highest office that General Electric, National Public Radio, or George Soros may freely broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.008" offset="316479">Its film may be shown in theaters, sold on DVDs, transmitted for downloading on the Internet, and its message may be distributed in the form of a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.458" offset="358275">But its producers face 5 years in prison if they offer it in the home through the vehicle of Video On Demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.704" offset="395264">Because the limitation on speech, political speech, is at the core of the First Amendment, the government has a heavy burden to establish each application of a restriction on that form of speech is a narrowly tailored response to a compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.819" offset="483767">The government cannot prove and has not attempted to prove that a 90-minute documentary made available to people who choose affirmatively to receive it, to opt in, by an ideologically oriented small corporation poses any threat of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.231" offset="577390">Indeed, this documentary is the very definition of robust, uninhibited debate about a subject of intense political interest that the First Amendment is there to guarantee.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.505" offset="650533">Well, it wouldn't -- definitely would not be the same because there are several aspects of the argument that we present.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.048" offset="684701">However, in one respect, it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.201" offset="693269">A 90-minute documentary was not the sort of thing that the -- the BCRA -- that the Congress was intended to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.698" offset="727333">In fact, as the -- as the Reporters Committee for -- for Freedom of Speech points out, the documentary is objectively indistinguishable from other news media commentary--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="167.928" offset="780204">But the -- the point, then, of similarity is you would, whether it was offered by General Motors or offered by -- by this Petitioner, in effect call for some qualification of the -- the general rule allowing limitations on corporate political activity of -- of the speech variety?</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="195.417" offset="890128">Well, one of the reasons that -- one of the bases upon which you would draw the line is to look at the documentary -- the voluminous documentary record that the government cites and this Court cited in the McConnell case as a justification for the restrictions themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.894" offset="960031">As--</text>

            <text syncTime="213.331" offset="961808">Well, would every -- in effect, every limitation on corporate speech or on corporate expenditure and the nature of speech be subject, then, to in effect this all-factor balancing test?</text>

          <turn speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="225.481" stopTime="250.552">
            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="225.481" offset="1010395">--Well, I think what I'm trying to say is that what the -- what the Congress was concerned with -- and Judge Kollar-Kotelly in the district court opinion that you considered in McConnell discusses this on page 646 of her opinion -- that this sort of communication was not something that Congress intended to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.849" offset="1091897">You would look at, if Congress intended to prohibit 90 minutes--</text>

            <text syncTime="250.552" offset="1110706">So -- so your -- your argument then is there's something distinct about the speech, which could be considered regardless of the corporate form?</text>

            <text syncTime="264.855" offset="1167862">That -- that still is going to involve a -- a fairly complicated set of analyses, probably in a lot of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.447" offset="1198268">Why is that necessary or worthwhile to preserve First Amendment values when you could have done this with a PAC?</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.890" offset="12188087">I mean, what's somewhat different about this case is that, unlike over-the-air television, you have a situation where you only get this -- this message would only air -- if somebody elects to hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.914" offset="12248168">So you really have two interested people, the speaker and the listener who wants to -- who wants to get this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.414" offset="12422144">I think it's certainly true that people have a wide variation of attitudes towards campaign advertisements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.124" offset="12489017">But the whole premise of the congressional regulation and the whole premise of the corporation's willingness to spend these massive amounts of money was that enough people will be interested in the advertisements that they will ultimately have an electoral effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.211" offset="12545337">And -- and so if you compare the -- the film to the advertisement, the advertisements, in one sense, you could say are a less effective mechanism because a lot of the people who reach them are unwilling listeners or uninterested.</text>
