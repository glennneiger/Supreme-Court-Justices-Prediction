            <text syncTime="7.337" offset="135753">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When the Texas courts in this case reinstated the Petitioner's direct appeal, the Texas Court of Appeals decided that appeal like it would decide any other case on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.163" offset="191133">We filed a petition for discretionary review in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which was denied, and it was considered like any other appeal would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.519" offset="224569">The question presented by this case is whether the final judgment that indisputably results from those rulings triggers the one-year statute of limitations to file a Federal habeas corpus application.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.260" offset="275456">The statute that governs that question is reproduced in the blue brief at page 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.831" offset="297817">Section 2244(d)( 1)(A) prescribes</text>
            <text syncTime="54.985" offset="326343">"a 1-year period of limitation that shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of the State court. "</text>

            <text syncTime="66.708" offset="373258">--and it identifies four dates, the first of which is</text>
            <text syncTime="68.577" offset="380782">"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of time for seeking such review. "</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="76.914" offset="414114">And you don't think you need to go beyond (A) to resolve the case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_c_goldstein" startTime="80.385" stopTime="163.638">
            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="80.385" offset="428011">That's right, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.868" offset="433967">Subsection (A) resolves this case by its plain terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.837" offset="449745">Now, the Fifth Circuit decided this case -- this issue, I'm sorry -- in 2004 in a case called Salinas, and it thought that the factual scenario of the case was more logically covered by subsection (d)( 2) of the statute, which is on page 2 of the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.732" offset="517350">And that provision is the tolling provision, and it says:</text>
            <text syncTime="106.750" offset="533441">"The time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under the subsection. "</text>
            <text syncTime="120.343" offset="587776">And the Fifth Circuit's view in that Salinas case was that the better way of looking at this is that when the State post-conviction court awarded relief of further direct review, all of that should be regarded as part of the post-conviction process.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.703" offset="645245">But four years after -- three years after the Fifth Circuit decided Salinas, this Court decided Lawrence v. Florida, and Lawrence disposes of the Fifth Circuit's logic in Salinas, because Lawrence says that when the post-conviction court, here the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, issues its mandate the application for post-conviction review is no longer pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.218" offset="735316">And so there isn't any reason to believe that Congress thought this factual scenario was covered by the tolling provisions of (d)( 2).</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="163.638" offset="761020">So, does your position depend upon the proposition that we are not free to consider sort of a second direct appeal as part of the collateral review process?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_c_goldstein" startTime="175.596" stopTime="191.336">
            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="175.596" offset="808876">It doesn't depend on it, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.679" offset="817131">We don't have to reach that question because, as I have said in answer to Justice Kennedy's question, you can resolve this under (d)( 1).</text>
            <text syncTime="183.583" offset="840746">But I was just trying to explain why the Fifth Circuit, which struggled with how to handle this scenario, was wrong in thinking it was governed by the tolling provision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="191.336" stopTime="214.602">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="191.336" offset="871779">I guess it doesn't -- or does it really make a difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="195.390" offset="887975">I mean, if you view the direct appeal that is the result of the collateral review process as part of the collateral review process, that time is tolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.060" offset="922666">And if you take your view and regard it as not final to trigger the process until you have another final decision, it kind of leads to the same result, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_c_goldstein" startTime="214.602" stopTime="250.841">
            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="214.602" offset="964880">In many cases, but not all, including this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.554" offset="976687">The difference is that if you regard this as governed by tolling, that the second -- what we will call for purposes of the argument, just so we know, the second appeal, so the appeal that's granted by the post-conviction report, if you regard the proper way of reading 2244 to be you have to regard that as being tolled and the start date is the dismissal of the original appeal, if the State Petitioner seeks post-conviction review more than one year after the dismissal of the first appeal, his Federal time is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.025" offset="1106568">So, this--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="250.841" stopTime="264.599">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="250.841" offset="1109807">But does that really matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="252.458" offset="1116285">I mean, the whole purpose of the Federal statute of limitations is to make sure these things get done within one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.695" offset="1141258">And if he waits a year before filing, then he's out of time under AEDPA.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_c_goldstein" startTime="264.599" stopTime="270.553">
            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="264.599" offset="1164873">--It is -- it is the case that Congress wanted it done within one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.902" offset="1178039">The question presented by this case is one year of what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="270.553" stopTime="271.004">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="270.553" offset="1188697">Right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_c_goldstein" startTime="271.004" stopTime="375.339">
            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="271.004" offset="1190473">So, there are four different possible start dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.504" offset="1200504">We know that the Fifth Circuit was wrong in the Salinas case when it said that Congress envisioned only a linear time period stopped only by tolling that would run from the first disposition of the case, because 2244(d)( 1)(B), (C), and (D) are all provisions under which the time can expire and then be restarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.304" offset="1283678">So, what we think Congress wanted when it was picking start dates and the start date in (d)( 1)(A), the one that usually applies, is it wanted the State courts on direct review to be done with the case, finish it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.278" offset="1331534">Then the State petitioner will have one year to start the State post-conviction process and when that's done go on to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.698" offset="1365285">The reason we think Congress wanted to include the second appeal, the conclusion of the second appeal, as the trigger is that what's going on in the Federal district court is you are trying to decide if the State court's disposition of the case is contrary to clearly established law as established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.762" offset="1441458">And you won't know that, you won't even know what the Federal district court is supposed to be reviewing, until the conclusion of the second appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.433" offset="1472178">If I could just illustrate that, in the joint appendix at page 43, is the State court opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.073" offset="1510734">The Texas Court of Appeals decided this case and resolved his, the Petitioner's, Federal constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.460" offset="1536334">And it only did that in the second appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.662" offset="1545112">And that's what Congress was concerned with the Federal district court's reviewing.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.464" offset="1564338">It's -- when this opinion is issued and then the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which is their highest court in criminal cases, denies review, then it's logical for the time period to start.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="375.339" stopTime="437.246">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="375.339" offset="1607805">In the background of this case, Mr. Goldstein, is that in fact he didn't know the first time that his appeal had been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.647" offset="1653049">He didn't know that his lawyer had filed an Anders brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.682" offset="1669141">But when he found that out, he waited some four and a half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.871" offset="1697980">So why isn't the -- Texas right when it says look at (B) and (D), they would have fit his case?</text>
            <text syncTime="407.993" offset="1738418">He could have used those to get time starting from the date that he found out.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.285" offset="1779587">It wouldn't give him four and a half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.070" offset="1794738">But why -- you say we, all we have to consider is (A); you said that in answer to Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.176" offset="1827129">But why shouldn't we say that either (B) or (D) fits his case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_c_goldstein" startTime="437.246" stopTime="539.112">
            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="437.246" offset="1855446">Okay, can I answer that question, Justice Ginsburg, in two parts?</text>
            <text syncTime="442.316" offset="1875717">First most directly, I want to explain our position with respect to (B) and (D) and then I want to discuss the broad thematic concern that's raised by our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.720" offset="1905288">Here's the troubling fact by our case, and that is the prospect that multiple State defendants will take more than a year, and I would like to deal with that thematic point and explain why I don't think that's a concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.176" offset="1943113">But to start directly with your point, (B) and (D), assuming that they apply for a moment, will only accomplish the following -- and then I want to explain why I don't think they would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.051" offset="1986685">But even if they apply, what they would do is defer the start date of the one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.054" offset="2006643">So on the facts in this case, one year after -- 11 months or so after the Texas Court of Appeals erroneously dismissed the Petitioner's first direct appeal without giving him the opportunity to file a pro se brief, he found out.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.297" offset="2067665">On the State's view, the one-year Federal habeas corpus time would be deferred for 11 months, and that is a very generous defendant-favoring position for Texas to take in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.105" offset="2110819">If it then starts, it doesn't -- that reading does not accomplish what Congress wanted in 2244, because the State prisoner, though the time will have been deferred for a year, will still have to file for Federal habeas corpus within a year, notwithstanding the fact that he will get a second direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.018" offset="2198486">So he will be proceeding in both courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.220" offset="2207368">His start date will have been deferred for 11 months, but he nonetheless one year later must appear in a Federal district court in Texas, even though on post-conviction review in the State courts he is sent back to direct review.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.112" offset="2262852">Oh, but is that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="540.230" offset="2267345">I mean unless you count, as I gather your friends on the other side would do, the period of direct appeal as part of the collateral review process?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="549.586" offset="2304752">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.086" offset="2306738">And that's the argument about Lawrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.705" offset="2313216">That argument is not sustainable in light of Lawrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.073" offset="2326695">Just to say that you have their argument exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice, the State's position is, as the Fifth Circuit held in the Salinas case, that when you get relief on post-conviction review and you are sent back to the State system, (d)( 2) continues to apply, but that is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.368" offset="2403913">The tolling stops, and that is because, as Lawrence held, the application which is his post-conviction application in the State court, saying that I was deprived of my right to appeal, is no longer pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.711" offset="2461278">The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has issued its mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.263" offset="2471518">So that's why this anomaly arises under the application of (B) or (D) that we don't think Congress could have intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.583" offset="2500775">Now, Justice Ginsburg, there is a second part to my answer, and that is the specific point about whether (B) and (D) do by their terms apply; and here we are in the anomalous position that if, again, Texas is arguing very defendant-favoring readings of (B) and (D) and I, representing the habeas Petitioner, am in the unusual role of questioning whether these later start dates apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.878" offset="2581964">But here our -- the lower courts I think it is clear would say that (B) and (D) don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.782" offset="2601608">To take you to the textual -- the text of the statute, again, (B) appears at the bottom of page 1 of the blue brief; and that has a start date of the date on which the impediment for filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.962" offset="2686245">And the lower courts, as we explained in our brief, pretty uniformly conclude that the failure to give a defendant notice that his appeal has been dismissed is not an impediment created by State action to him filing a Federal habeas corpus application.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.288" offset="2743609">And so their attempt to grapple with our unusual facts has -- would substantially broaden the application of subsection (B).</text>

            <text syncTime="666.561" offset="2772658">What about the State convicting, penalizing the defendant despite the fact that his constitutional right to competent counsel was -- he lost that right because of the failure of notification?</text>

            <text syncTime="686.705" offset="2853219">The -- the courts -- the lower courts take quite literally that there has to be an impediment.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.843" offset="2869833">The lower court decisions grappling with what an impediment is deal with the situation where a prison warden, for example, does not allow you access to the prison mails or somehow access to the legal resources you in order to be able to file it.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.028" offset="2986548">And the reason the State is not right about that provision and does not even really seriously argue it is that the claims referenced in (D) are the claims that are presented in the Federal habeas corpus application.</text>

            <text syncTime="773.830" offset="3201797">As -- the language that we use in a footnote in our reply brief addressing this is whether the proceeding has the hallmarks of direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.769" offset="3237533">There are two States that do have a procedure, South Carolina and Delaware, in which you can raise your claim on post-conviction review that you were deprived of your right to a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.161" offset="3291136">And the post-conviction court has the power to decide that on post-conviction review.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.898" offset="3314019">We haven't found a case in which they actual exercised the power, but it appears that 48 of the 50 States deal with this problem the way Texas does, and that is the relief that you get is that you are sent back into the direct review system.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.574" offset="3364697">And then we think it's covered quite plainly by the text of (d)( 1).</text>
            <text syncTime="818.359" offset="3379848">When that direct review is over, direct review concludes by its plain terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.430" offset="3400119">Now, Justice Ginsburg, I had said that I wanted to come back and deal with the thematic problem that might concern the Court about our case, and that is the prospect that we will have defendants filing State post-conviction applications more than a year late, which could trouble the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.856" offset="3461872">As the Chief Justice indicated, Congress had a concern with moving this process along.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.807" offset="3477650">In addition just to the plain text of the statute which we think is controlling, there are I think three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.295" offset="3499593">The first is there are State limitations principles that get these State prisoners to file their applications in a timely way.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.401" offset="3532089">Now, in the great majority of States that's set by a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.353" offset="3547867">In some States like Texas it's applied by the principle of laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.905" offset="3566049">And the important point and the reason we are here today is that Texas, for whatever reason -- and the time limitations are intended to protect Texas here -- decided not to assert that his State post-conviction application was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.998" offset="3618398">It didn't object to the granting of relief to the Petitioner at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.350" offset="3631877">The second reason, in addition to the State's own limitations period, is that the AEDPA one-year limitations period has real force.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.805" offset="3669703">In the great majority of cases in which a State defendant is going to allege that he was deprived of his right to an appeal and raise that claim on State post-conviction review, he's going to lose that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.763" offset="3717454">The -- the States don't give this stuff out like candy, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is not, you know, constantly reinstating defendant's appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.202" offset="3751205">And defendants know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.988" offset="3758414">And unless you prevail on this claim, you are stuck with the one-year AEDPA time that runs from the dismissal of your first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.492" offset="3788403">And so you have every incentive in the world to get into State court quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.711" offset="3805330">And the third is just the general notion that defendants in non-capital cases don't have a real incentive to just delay before instituting a State post-conviction review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2196.853" offset="8893879">It also has to have caused the inmate not to be able to file his -- his timely Federal habeas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.930" offset="9054166">From that date, he waited four and a half years to seek any type of post-conviction review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.922" offset="9430120">And that's -- that's not true, because the situation in Lawrence was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.426" offset="9452168">In Lawrence, the Court's decision said that inmate had exhausted all of his post-conviction review in the Florida courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.580" offset="9480798">He had gone all the way to the top court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.432" offset="9488217">There was no State court left for him to go to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.884" offset="9502009">And the question was, when he then came to this Court with a cert petition, could that cert petition count as tolling time of review for the State post-conviction review?</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.322" offset="9539730">The Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.322" offset="9543701">That's not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.024" offset="9550493">This is more like the Court's decision in Carey versus Saffold, where in, Carey, the Court said -- the Court acknowledged that under California law where inmates can, if they lose their habeas in a lower court, they can then file an original writ in a higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.951" offset="9610261">The Court said that, while the inmate is going through that process, the collateral review of the underlying judgment remained pending, it remained in continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.723" offset="9645369">And that's what's happening here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.473" offset="9652370">If you look at what happened in the Texas court, when the inmate files his habeas petition, the habeas petition itself is not reviewing the pertinent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.198" offset="9691240">That's the language of (d)( 2), "reviewing the pertinent judgment".</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.316" offset="9703675">That habeas petition asks for a second proceeding to review the pertinent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.136" offset="9726976">It says, can you give me another proceeding, the out-of-time appeal, to review the pertinent judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.422" offset="9748083">And so, when the inmate receives that, when he -- if he gets the out-of-time appeal, then the next step, the out-of-time appeal, is where the judgment is reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.711" offset="9781311">So, the Court's rationale in Carey is applicable with even greater force here because the State courts have told him: File another -- you know, continue your proceeding so you can get review of the underlying judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.038" offset="9834600">And it anticipates a two-step process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.573" offset="9844736">So you might say that the out-of-time appeal is the remedy portion of the habeas proceeding in Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.252" offset="11531410">The reasoning has been that it's because the State was able to get or keep a conviction without the inmate having due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3141.999" offset="12674424">The first is Congress has already made that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.518" offset="12688530">Obviously Congress was concerned that even non-capital inmates could sit on their rights because they imposed this strict one-year limitation on non-capital inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.707" offset="12717265">But the second point is that as a practical matter this happens in many, many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.028" offset="12738581">These cases provide the example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.911" offset="12746104">In this case the inmate waited five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.396" offset="12756031">The Frasch v Peguese case that is coming out of the Fourth Circuit on an out-of-time appeal, the inmate -- a non-capital inmate waited ten years to seek post-conviction review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.704" offset="12797304">And so these are cases that we think are representative of many case that would come through the district courts, and that in fact non-capital inmates, whatever their incentives may be, do as a practical matter sometimes sit on their rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.665" offset="13389134">Justice Stevens, if later on you have an opportunity to look at footnote 15 on page 42 of the blue brief, we cite eight cases, and there are more, in which these out-of-time appeals really did find meritorious claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.090" offset="13438767">And I -- so I don't want the Court to be left with the impression that this is much ado about nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.558" offset="13456635">The rule of law will actually be quite significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.927" offset="13466143">Two small corrections to things my friend inadvertently said or impressions he may have inadvertently left.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.629" offset="13488922">He says there are 19 States that have no statute of limitations, but that omits the very many of those States that apply laches, and the fact that the State of Texas here did not assert the untimeliness of the State post-conviction proceeding is pretty much I think why we are ultimately here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.506" offset="13552452">He also said that there is only one State opinion finding laches, as if, I think, to create the impression that Texas courts don't take laches seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.279" offset="13587560">Most of these are disposed of without opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.248" offset="13599472">But the more relevant important is that there aren't Texas State opinions rejecting claims of laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.033" offset="13618594">What the Texas courts have made is that the Texas A.G.'s office has to assert the defense of laches, as is true everywhere and is true in this Court's jurisprudence as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.158" offset="13655061">The final two points I wanted to make are about (d)( 1)(B) and (d)( 2), all of which, I think honestly reduced to Justice Kennedy's point, is that the relevant provision is (d)( 1), whatever else is going on in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.966" offset="13702290">But Justice Scalia and the Chief Justice came back to the point about whether this is an impediment, and my friend kept answering it is State action, and the Court would say, but is it an impediment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.553" offset="13736667">And at page 20 of our reply brief we must cite eight or ten cases, three of which notably are from Texas; there were litigated by the Texas Attorney General's office, that make it clear that the failure to give the notice of the opinion is not an impediment to filing post-conviction review, and the Court would be rewriting a lot of habeas corpus law to rule for the State of Texas here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.770" offset="13841575">That's a State action, but as the Court's questioning indication, the question is, is State action that is an impediment to filing a Federal habeas petition, and all of our cases answered that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.745" offset="13881386">The final point is about (d)( 2) and my friend says that this isn't like Lawrence v Florida, because here there is more proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.101" offset="13918898">But the Court's holding was this, and it was unambiguous: When the post-conviction court enters its mandate, so that the time to seek cert starts to run, that's when the post-conviction application is no longer pending; and when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals decided the Petitioner's claim and said he had an out-of-time appeal, it issued its mandate and the mandate is in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.097" offset="14006878">And somebody -- the State could have sought cert in that case, and the post-conviction application was no longer pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.168" offset="14031120">And Mr. Chief Justice, you're right, you can the case on the basis of label or substance, but it is unambiguous that this is not post-conviction review in what we have been calling the second appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.107" offset="14070826">Teague retroactivity does not apply; all the constitutional rights that are announced in the meantime apply; you have a right to a counsel; the usual standards of post-conviction relief in terms of having us show an extra layer of prejudice don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.598" offset="14128818">This is just like any other appeal the Texas Court of Appeals and the courts of criminal appeal would decide and that makes it a (d)( 1) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.853" offset="14153895">Thank you very much.</text>
