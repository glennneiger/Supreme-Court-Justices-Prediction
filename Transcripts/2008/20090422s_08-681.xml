            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="28">I have the opinion of the Court this morning in Nken versus Holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.608" offset="46421">The Government may order that aliens who are here illegally be removed from the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.042" offset="68155">There is a procedure that the Government has to go through before doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.942" offset="83724">That procedure provides the alien with certain legal protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.393" offset="101592">An alien, who loses a challenge to the procedures in his case and still subject to an order of removal, can appeal to a Federal Court of Appeals and many do.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.816" offset="147254">But the order directing that the alien be removed is not automatically held in advance while the appeal is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.972" offset="175884">So that he has not taken out of the country while his appeal is pending, an alien can seek a stay of the removal order, pending decision of his appeal and many do.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.101" offset="216426">The Courts of Appeals that consider whether to grant or deny the stay, requests to hold things up while they're deciding the underlying challenge, have developed different rules about how to decide them.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.074" offset="264283">The rule should be the same across the country, so we granted review to decide what it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.454" offset="289778">Now, there is a well established general standard for considering stay requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.115" offset="308482">That standard ask whether the party seeking the stay is likely to succeed on the merits, whether that party will be irreparably injured if his stay is denied, were there other parties will be injured if a stay is granted and how the public interest would be affected by the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.167" offset="380684">Now, the issue before us arises because Congress, in 1996, passed a law changing some of the removal rules, among other things, that law provided that no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien, unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that his removal is prohibited as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.592" offset="470337">Now, this is a more difficult standard for the alien to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.426" offset="485697">The court below held that I is more difficult standard applied rather thank the traditional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.976" offset="515894">But the new law does not refer to stays, but rather to authority to enjoin removal and although there is certainly some overlap between stays and injunctions, the two traditionally refer to different forms of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.379" offset="569497">An injunction is a coercive order that directs someone to do something, or a stay operates upon a judicial proceeding by temporarily divesting in order under review of enforceability.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.911" offset="619652">The language instructor of the new statutory provision does not convince us that enjoin in that provision was intended to covers stays.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.867" offset="659463">The authority to stay a case pending appeal is critical to ensure that a court can carefully consider a case before its decision is too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.722" offset="698856">We do not think that the standard for injunctions in the new law would meet that need which causes us to doubt that Congress meant to apply the new standard to stays.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.573" offset="746294">For these and other reasons set forth in our opinion, we conclude that the traditional standard is the right one.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.782" offset="771058">But there are good arguments on the other side, and they have been ably said out in the descent filed by Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.313" offset="797181">At the end of the day however, we do not think that the more difficult test for injunctions in the new law sets the standard for stays.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.372" offset="833439">It's important to recognize however that under the traditional standard, a stay is not a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.574" offset="858307">In exercising its discretion, the Court cannot simply assume that removal of the alien is categorically and irreparable harm, but that the balance of hardships always waves in the aliens favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.015" offset="908044">An alien, who seeks a stay, bares the burden of establishing that he needs the requirement of the traditional standard before the Court should hold in advance the publics undeniable interest in the prompt execution of removal orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.286" offset="965096">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded for consideration of the can stay application under the standards set forth in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.149" offset="1004593">Justice Kennedy has filed the concurring opinion joined by Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.612" offset="1022461">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
