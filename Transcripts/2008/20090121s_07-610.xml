            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Breyer has the opinion of the Court this morning in case 07-610, Locke versus Karass.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="7.797" offset="137634">Under Maine state law, like a lot of state laws, if a government employee disagrees with and does not belong to the local union that represents that employee and all the others in the workplace, then the one who disagrees still has to pay the union something, a service fee instead of the union dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.140" offset="223002">Now this Court has long held in principle that although there are certain exceptions, Government may require this kind of a payment without violating the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.508" offset="268455">It's not quite voluntary but still they can pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.633" offset="280994">The union can charge them.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.167" offset="291129">Now in this case, which is a kind of question I find that draw that line between what they can and cannot charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.424" offset="320178">A local union charges the nonmembers a service fee that among other things reflects an affiliation fee that the local pays the national.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.582" offset="360824">Now that affiliation fee that all the locals pay the national in turn has a component that the national uses in order to pay its lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.573" offset="400739">So the question is whether, the local, when it charges the nonmembers their pro rata share of the dues, whether it can include a pro rata share of that part of the fee it's going to pay the national that goes to paying the national's lawyers' litigation expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.847" offset="477853">That's the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.387" offset="484018">And the answer to the question in our view is yes, it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.845" offset="497810">And there are two conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.518" offset="508468">First, it has to be that litigation that the national is involved in has to be the subject matter, has to be the kind that would be chargeable if local litigation by unions were at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.971" offset="562280">And second, the litigation involved, that kind of obligation that charged for the national, it has to be reciprocal in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.818" offset="597703">So the local that gives the money to the national has to expect that other locals will contribute to its problems that need to be resolved by litigation just as it is now contributing to the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.968" offset="646290">But where those two things are concerned, subject matter is right and there is reciprocity, then the union can charge the nonmembers that money and our opinion explains why all that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.692" offset="697177">And we affirm the Court of Appeals' decision which reached a similar conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.593" offset="712850">Our decision is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.436" offset="720165">Justice Alito has filed the concurring opinion which the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia have joined.</text>
