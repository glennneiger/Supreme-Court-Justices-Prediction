            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">Justice Souter has the opinion of the Court in case 07-543, AT&amp;T Corporation versus Hulteen.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="8.801" offset="142629">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.820" offset="166766">AT&amp;T provides pensions and other benefits based on a seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.987" offset="187455">The system relies on an employee's term of employment which is understood as the period of service to the company minus uncredited leave time.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.494" offset="221414">In the 1960s and early to mid 1970s, AT&amp;T gave full service credit to employees on disability leave, but did not treat pregnancy-related absence as equivalent to disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.772" offset="278570">Women including Noreen Hulteen therefore received less service credit for pregnancy leave than they would have accrued on the same leave for disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.508" offset="317544">At that time, AT&amp;T's differential leave policy was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.867" offset="334890">This Court in the case of General Electric Company against Gilbert concluded that a disability plan excluding disabilities related to pregnancy was not sex-based discrimination within the meaning of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.793" offset="390687">In 1979, in response to Gilbert, Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act or PDA which amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and defined sex-based discrimination to include discrimination because of or on the basis of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.153" offset="464039">In light of the change in the law, AT&amp;T promptly changed its policy and provided service credit for pregnancy leave on the same basis as leave taken for other temporary disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.240" offset="512418">AT&amp;T did not however, make any retroactive adjustments to the service credit calculations of women who had been subject to the pre-PDA policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.363" offset="552960">Hulteen has now retired and if her total term of employment had not been decreased due to her pre-PDA pregnancy leave, she would be entitled to a greater pension benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.941" offset="599249">She sued AT&amp;T seeking increased benefits alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.762" offset="634567">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found such a violation but we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.610" offset="657868">Section 703(h) of Title VII expressly protects the application of different standards of compensation under the terms of a bona fide seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.762" offset="702485">In other words, it insulates from challenge seniority systems producing differences that are not the result of an intention to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.405" offset="737071">Hulteen argues that AT&amp;T's differential leave policy was discriminatory and that the policy infects the seniority system making the differences, it generates the different pension pay outs, open the challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.855" offset="790883">But in light of this Court's decision in Gilbert, the fact that the -- and the fact that the PDA is not retroactive, AT&amp;T's differential leave policy cannot be considered as illegal when done and therefore, cannot be termed intentionally discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.694" offset="854204">AT&amp;T's seniority system is therefore a bona fide system under Section 703(h) and is insulated from challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.335" offset="892761">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.301" offset="904673">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Breyer joins.</text>
