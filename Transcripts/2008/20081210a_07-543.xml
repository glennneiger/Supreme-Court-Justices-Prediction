            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">We will hear argument next in Case 07-543, AT&amp;T Corporation v. Hulteen.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.404" offset="137091">Mr. Phillips.</text>

          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="8.270" stopTime="108.185">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="8.270" offset="140539">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When Judge Wood on the Seventh Circuit addressed precisely the same issue that's before this Court, I think she correctly observed that the distinction between an ongoing violation that arises with each new use of a seniority system and the present effect of a past discrimination is a distinction that is subtle at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.721" offset="242312">But it is the line that this Court has asked the lower courts to draw, and I think the majority of those courts have actually drawn that line appropriately, although you could actually probably argue that it's more a scatter plot than it is a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.647" offset="302080">And I think it's a scatter plot that essentially looks to three primary factors in evaluating whether or not this is a case that is more like Evans and Lorance and Ledbetter, or a case that is more like Bazemore.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.573" offset="361744">And those three factors are the stale nature of the claims, whether or not there is a seniority at stake, and whether or not the employees have fair and adequate notice at the time of the action of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.750" offset="414511">Let's look at the staleness of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.033" offset="423602">In this particular case, we are talking about maternity leaves that were taken by -- taken by the Respondents between 1968 and 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.272" offset="460591">The information that's available to AT&amp;T today is simply whether or not these particular individuals were paid for periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.378" offset="489012">There is nothing more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.495" offset="493401">We have no way of knowing whether or not these were maternity leaves or not maternity leaves, whether these were leaves to go to school, leaves to take care of -- of parents, or leaves for any other particular purpose.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="108.185" stopTime="150.346">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="108.185" offset="540212">But at the time -- at the time of the original reduction of credits, was there any right claimed that any of these women had?</text>
            <text syncTime="122.962" offset="599353">I mean, nothing had happened to them except there was a bookkeeping entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.766" offset="618580">They wouldn't be hurt until they sought retirement or sought some other benefit that increased seniority would give them.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.705" offset="658286">But could they have come into court just from, on the books of AT&amp;T, they were docked X number of days?</text>
            <text syncTime="147.160" offset="696111">Nothing has happened as a consequence of that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="150.346" stopTime="225.929">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="150.346" offset="708859">Justice Ginsburg, they not only could have, but they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.500" offset="721502">If you look at the Eighth Circuit's decision -- and, indeed, Respondents in this case did -- in the Communications Worker case out of the Eighth Circuit, which is 602 F. 2d 304, they specifically alleged that one of the Bell operating companies, one of the subsidiaries, had, in fact, refused to grant these -- these exact service credits, sued on that basis pre PDA, and alleged that they were entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.049" offset="823693">The Eighth Circuit in that case looked at this Court's decision in Gilbert and looked at this Court's decision in Satty, and said specifically this case is more like Gilbert than it's like Satty, but never remotely questioned that that was an actionable claim at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.327" offset="888790">And, candidly, it seems to me clear that that's an actionable claim because there -- there is very little that is quite as critical in this process -- in the employment relationship as seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.433" offset="933198">And -- and we are not talking about simply benefits seniority here.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.837" offset="946782">We are talking about competitive seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.137" offset="955977">So whether you have a -- a better claim to a cushier job or -- or to better working conditions, all of those are determined on the basis of -- of seniority, which is being decided on an individualized basis.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="225.929" stopTime="255.199">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="225.929" offset="1011148">But it hadn't been applied in any of those situations yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.548" offset="1021701">At -- at the -- at the point when the person returns from leave and is docked a certain number of days, it hasn't been applied to any of the situations you mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.308" offset="1076663">I grant you the case would be totally ripe if there was a better job to bid for, if there was an early retirement opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.330" offset="1112816">But here there was nothing -- nothing to be done.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="255.199" stopTime="330.247">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="255.199" offset="1128281">Well, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I question the premise that there was nothing to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.567" offset="1145731">I think the average person told that they have less seniority today than they had yesterday, and if they were told that on the basis of -- of gender-based discrimination or race-based discrimination, would say: I am entitled to go to court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.993" offset="1199438">Not only do I think that that's the way most people would react to it, but the reality is if you look at the way the litigation arose in the Eighth Circuit case that I alluded to earlier, these very -- the same union here made exactly that claim prior to the passage of the PDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.020" offset="1267566">So the notion that the employees, one, didn't have notice -- they clearly did have notice -- and, two, didn't have an incentive to act, they clearly did have an incentive to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.978" offset="1307376">And I think this is not much different from what the Court said in Ricks, which is that obviously you have more of an incentive when you feel the true pain of a -- of a discriminatory act, assuming the act was in -- was, in fact, discriminatory, but the obligation to respond more -- to respond sooner remains on the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.307" offset="1388669">And, again, to go back to the point I was trying to make initially, these are all claims that arose -- these are all actions taken between 1968 and 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.663" offset="1426077">And one of the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="330.247" stopTime="361.801">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="330.247" offset="1428480">But you -- you have to, I think, recognize that there's a big difference between Evans, who was told, goodbye, you got married, you have to resign -- a definite act that had immediate consequences -- and this, where there -- there is a potential for future consequences but no immediate consequence of the kind that existed in your model case, Evans.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="361.801" stopTime="544.868">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="361.801" offset="1554704">--I mean, Justice Ginsburg, there's -- there's no question that the impact in Evans is -- is stronger than the impact here.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.121" offset="1579990">I will readily concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.488" offset="1585424">But what I won't concede is that the importance of seniority is so far down the pecking order or so de minimis in its impact that it would be reasonable to assume that the average employee, told that I'm am taking away your seniority on the basis -- on the basis of your race, would then sit back and say: I'm not going to do anything; I'm going to wait until the impact of that is felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.868" offset="1670896">To the contrary, you would expect, given the -- the centrality of seniority as a term of employment, that any employee under those circumstances would respond, you know, almost immediately under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.461" offset="1725336">The -- the second factor in this case that, it seems to me, this Court has relied upon significantly in the prior decisions that have come out on the side of not allowing this kind of litigation to go forward is we are talking about a seniority system here.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.519" offset="1777580">And the -- as I said a minute ago, it's not just the rights of the individual and what benefits she might be entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.743" offset="1814465">The seniority system obviously affects the rights of all members of the -- of the seniority plan and all of the pension plan and the entire system that the seniority operates on.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.432" offset="1853231">And so there are third-party interests that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.051" offset="1863680">And, again, both Congress and this Court's decisions have consistently recognized that when that situation arises, the resolution of the question ought to be to say, no, these are present effects of past discriminatory acts; we should be loath to try to interfere with those -- with that seniority scheme under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.048" offset="1947690">And then the third factor that it seems to me the Court has been concerned about -- and it's one we have been discussing -- which is the -- the -- you know, the adequacy of the notice, where the employee is put on notice at the time that actions were being taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.938" offset="1995233">Now, we can quarrel about how serious the -- the actions were, how detrimental they might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.176" offset="2020206">But it seems to me there is no question that the -- that the injury here is real and that the average employee being told that you are being deprived of seniority on -- on a race-based or sex-based or any other condition that is protected would act immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.602" offset="2077884">Now, it seems to me that the only argument that the -- that the Respondents offer on the other side -- and it's almost a mantra-like exposition by them and it was certainly the basis for the Ninth Circuit, and I think it's where the mistake arises -- is this claim that this is -- is a facially discriminatory policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.563" offset="2145698">And their argument is if it's facially discriminatory, then you can apply it now, and all of the reasons why this Court has not applied these -- these kinds of claims in the past in Evans and Lorance and Ledbetter is -- is -- are off the hook in this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.573" offset="2205780">But the truth is this is not a facially discriminatory policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.775" offset="2222602">In the first place, this exact same policy was looked at in "Sah-tee" or "Sat-ee".</text>
            <text syncTime="534.679" offset="2246217">I don't know exactly how to pronounce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.912" offset="2251128">And the Court said these kinds of arrangements where you don't give service credit for people who take pregnancy leave is not facially discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.368" offset="2284983">So--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="544.868" stopTime="549.855">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="544.868" offset="2286968">But that was when Gilbert was prevailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.820" offset="2294700">Certainly, we would not regard it that way today.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="549.855" stopTime="606.441">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="549.855" offset="2306926">--Well, I don't know whether it would be regarded as facially discriminatory today.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.806" offset="2326674">I think it would be regarded as illegal today.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.275" offset="2336601">Whether it would be facially discriminatory I think is a -- is a trickier question, because again it seems to me that -- that the other side relies heavily on the statement in Lorance about facially discriminatory plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.583" offset="2385816">But what the Court described as a facially discriminatory plan in that day was it was -- in that case, was a situation where every day a male worker is credited with a full day of work for a day's -- a day's effort, and a woman is credited with half a day's work for a day's effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.378" offset="2453002">And -- and the Court said, quite rightly, that's a facially discriminatory plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.931" offset="2471184">Well, we don't have anything like that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.948" offset="2479229">This plan was changed in the wake of the passage of the PDA to bring it completely in compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.121" offset="2507964">So the plan, as it operates today, is -- is not only not facially discriminatory; it is in no way discriminatory--</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="606.441" offset="2533251">But you -- what about -- I'm trying to work with this distinction where I agree with you that it's hard to see exactly what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.011" offset="2559478">But if I look at Bazemore, I think there we have a large number of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.331" offset="2584764">And if you look at a complicated thing, a salary structure, earlier, you see that that salary structure systemically paid black people less than white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.073" offset="2639726">And at the time, for whatever reasons, there wasn't a statute -- we assume that that was lawful at the time.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="639.578" offset="2665744">Then later it turns out that they are keeping that salary structure, although not for racially motivated reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.934" offset="2703256">They are keeping it simply because that's what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.802" offset="2714645">And the Court says, you've taken that complex structure, and you are administering it now, and the administration of it now is what is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.158" offset="2752052">Then, look at your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.360" offset="2760934">We had a complicated structure involving seniority, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.746" offset="2782459">And part of that old seniority system was this rule which was legal at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.882" offset="2803043">It is no longer legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.167" offset="2812134">Now, we move that structure over until now, and we see we are administering the same complex structure today in the same kind of way that was at issue at Bazemore.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.892" offset="2863020">It's a complicated set of rules that you have to apply today in order to see who is entitled to what, just as they did that in Bazemore.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.598" offset="2901891">So I began to think, doesn't that, on the key matter, look very much like Bazemore?</text>
            <text syncTime="704.335" offset="2924774">What is your response?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="706.604" stopTime="747.745">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="706.604" offset="2933864">Justice Breyer, I -- I -- in looking at this case, I have long thought of it as kind of an M.C. Escher picture, where you look at it from one direction and it looks one way, and then you turn it and you look at it the other way, and it looks completely different to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.744" offset="2986423">But I think the right answer to -- to your analysis is that the way to look at Bazemore is that every day after the statute was enacted, every employee who showed up to work who was black was paid less than every employee who showed up to work who was white.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.872" offset="3058939">And that, it seems to me, as the Court said in Bazemore, unanimously and without a whole lot of fanfare, is just something simply illegal under Title VII under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.465" offset="3125290">People here are not showing up for work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.103" offset="6003879">The seniority system in this case is facially neutral; it just accords seniority to men and women on an equal basis depending on whether they took disability leave or personal leave.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.657" offset="6138044">Just like in Evans, men and women were denied seniority or service credit if they were terminated for -- for charge, and there was a separate unlawful policy that basically defined -- cause -- excuse me -- if you were terminated for cause -- and a separate policy that defined "cause" to say, well, if you were a female flight attendant and you married, then you were forced to resign.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.076" offset="12143804">Again, I think the distinction between Evans and this case is discrimination that occurred entirely outside of a -- the seniority system and discrimination within the seniority system that gives unequal credit for equal service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.469" offset="12645355">It did not hold that AT&amp;T was liable for anything it did prior to the effective date of the PDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.623" offset="12665940">It didn't, for example, hold that it was liable simply because it moved the NCS dates or because it relied on them in any way before the effective date of the PDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.729" offset="12702407">All it said was that AT&amp;T is precluded from relying on that discriminatory measure of service in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.217" offset="12728320">And in that sense, this case is quite like this Court's decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Company, where the Court said Title VII prohibits employers from relying on the results of discriminatory employment tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.957" offset="12775340">Now, nobody thought that that meant that Title VII subjected to liability employers who administered or relied on those tests before the effective date of Title VII, but everybody understood that they couldn't rely on those results after the effective date of Title VII, and nobody thought that that gave the statute a retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.319" offset="12844722">And that's all that the Ninth Circuit interpreted the PDA to do here, is to prohibit AT&amp;T from engaging in the post-Act reliance on those pre-Act discriminatory measures, that AT&amp;T had every opportunity to conform its -- to conform its conduct to the -- to the requirements of the PDA, and a statute that simply tells an employer how it has to treat past events for future employment decision purposes is simply not a statute that has a retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.623" offset="12970005">Finally, I'd like to -- if I have time, I'd like to address this suggestion from the Solicitor General's Office that this doesn't involve seniority discrimination at all because what we are talking about here is discrimination that occurred with respect to the personnel policy about the classification of leave, as opposed to discrimination within the seniority system itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.919" offset="13047118">And this Court was clear in California Brewers that an accrual rule that says how time counts for seniority purposes is part of the seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.108" offset="13079928">And under AT&amp;T's system, it's true you have to apply a two-part rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.309" offset="13096751">You have to know whether -- if you are asked, does this pregnancy leave count, you have to ask, well, is it personal leave?</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.748" offset="13122456">But that doesn't tell you anything until you apply the second part of the rule that says pregnancy leave counts as -- as personal leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.652" offset="13154116">And because you need to know the answers to -- to both of those questions, both parts of the rules are properly considered to be part of the accrual rule and part of the seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.592" offset="13189851">Finally, if I -- if I could return once again to this alternative argument that we have, that even setting aside Bazemore and section 706(e)( 2), this is not -- our clients weren't required to challenge this discrimination before because it wasn't an completed, unlawful employment practice at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.921" offset="13271144">And, again, the point is that discrimination with respect to a small amount of time going towards seniority doesn't affect even the worker's actual seniority, that is, her place in the seniority hierarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.598" offset="13321822">A worker who is 2 years' junior to the person who is next in line above her and 2 years' senior to the person next in line below her -- 6 weeks of service credit aren't going to make any difference with respect to her place on the seniority hierarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.089" offset="13379814">It's not going to make any difference with respect to her ability to bid for jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.060" offset="13395696">And it's not necessarily even going to make any difference with respect to her pension, because at the time that these leaves are taken typically, the person is years away, perhaps decades away, from even vesting in their pension benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.200" offset="13444284">And Congress reasonably would have thought, I think, that that kind of harm is too speculative to warrant immediate -- to warrant the requirement that the employees have to immediately challenge that kind of discrimination at the time it occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.441" offset="13497260">That's why Congress enacted section 706(e)( 2), to give employees an opportunity to wait until the discrimination has a concrete effect on their employment status, on their compensation or terms of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.915" offset="13547102">And AT&amp;T's view of the statute--</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.008" offset="13603527">They can't bring the claim until it has a concrete impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.293" offset="13616692">Now, if 706(e)( 2) applies, they can challenge the system as of -- when it's adopted or when it's applied to them, but otherwise they have to wait until it injures them within the meaning of section 706(e)( 2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.184" offset="13664235">And that's a perfectly sensible rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.934" offset="13671236">Remember, we're talking here about facial discrimination, and the concerns about stale evidence are not particularly strong here because -- and, as a result, we are able to stipulate to the underlying facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.992" offset="13715435">Everybody knows what the system was and what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.278" offset="13724630">And there's no reasonable dispute about whether the reduction in our clients' leaves was as a result of pregnancy versus something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.681" offset="13754201">And in any event, this is simply a consequence Congress must have intended when it said that discriminatory seniority systems are open to challenge whenever they apply to injure a worker, even if that means that so long -- if an employer implements a plan for 30 years, Congress understood that that meant that they were subject to suit for 30 years.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="3434.978" offset="13847406">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.994" offset="13855451">I'd just like to make a couple of points: Justice Ginsburg, you asked a question about the earlier litigation, and let me just quote from the first page of Judge Bright's opinion where it says the appellants in the class action allege that Southwestern Bell discriminates against women by, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.821" offset="13914802">"refusing to extend full seniority credit to female employees on maternity leave. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.391" offset="13937058">That is precisely the claim that's being litigated in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.711" offset="13954299">And contrary to my brother's position just a few minutes ago, that these don't have any impact and why would anybody act on the basis of them, it seems to me that that lawsuit belies that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.984" offset="13995363">They recognize the impact on seniority, and they acted immediately as a consequence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.138" offset="14016052">Justice Souter, I do agree with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.257" offset="14024516">I think the reason that Bazemore is not the -- I wouldn't say "line" -- more the point of authority to be as the departure in this particular case is because of the implications for the seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.398" offset="14073104">Justice Kennedy, the problem here is we don't know exactly what the impact's going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.301" offset="14096718">What we do know is that all plans are funded on a set of actuarial assumptions, and, candidly, if they say we were overfunded a couple months ago, given to what has happened to my pension plans in the last couple of months, I would worry a little bit about what the situation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.180" offset="14172160">But the -- but the most fundamental point is you don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.232" offset="14188356">And in that context, what we do understand is that Congress routinely says protect the seniority systems, protect the pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.088" offset="14219807">You know, my colleague says, well, but this is all form over substance because what if they come back at the end and decided to do all these calculations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.526" offset="14257528">That fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the pension process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.828" offset="14270798">You have to fund these in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.930" offset="14283233">You make actuarial assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.630" offset="14290024">No one is in a position where they're going to allow the determination of seniority to be made at the tail end without making assumptions about what they are going to be like going in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.569" offset="14329731">And, Justice Breyer, I think that is the answer to your question because we are not taking this complex system wholesale and just dumping it post PDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.675" offset="14366198">What we did is we retained the specific rules with respect to the accrual and the seniority, and we eliminated the underlying distinctions between pregnancy and other kinds of disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.601" offset="14425861">And that's how we apply it, and that, frankly, is fundamentally different from Bazemore because we are not discriminating every day in a way that harms them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.123" offset="14459925">We made a seniority decision, like a pay decision, pre-Act; now we are acting -- it's not a pay decision post-Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.979" offset="14495347">And it's -- to my mind in that sense it is just like Evans and that line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.300" offset="14516663">Finally, you asked the question, Justice Souter, could Congress have done -- have done exactly what the Respondents ask?</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.303" offset="14544666">And the answer to that is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.669" offset="14550100">Congress could say today we're not going to allow this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.502" offset="14561489">It would upset a lot of pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.521" offset="14569535">It would upset a lot of expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.406" offset="14577058">Congress could have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.706" offset="14582282">Congress didn't do it, or at least if it were going to upset all of those reliance interests, Congress would have done so in language that was much more explicit than what it has done in the PDA and 706(e)( 2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.016" offset="14639543">If there are no further questions, Your Honor, I urge you to reverse the judgment below.</text>
