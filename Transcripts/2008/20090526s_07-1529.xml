            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Scalia has our opinion this morning in case 07-1529, Montejo versus Louisiana.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="8.206" stopTime="433.168">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="8.206" offset="139306">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.481" offset="160413">Jesse Montejo under arrest for the murder of Lewis Ferrari waived his Miranda rights and was interrogated by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.105" offset="198865">He told several conflicting stories about his involvement in the crime ultimately admitting that he had shot Ferrari in the course of botched burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.975" offset="238362">Several days later, Montejo was brought before a Louisiana Court for a preliminary hearing at which the judge ordered on his own initiative and as required by state law that counsel be appointed to represent the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.228" offset="303355">Later that same day, police investigators approached Montejo at the prison where he was being held and requested that he accompany them on a search for the murder weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.519" offset="348494">Montejo again waived his Miranda rights and agreed to go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.879" offset="365944">During the ride, he wrote an inculpatory letter of apology to the victim's widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.946" offset="390186">This case concerns the admissibility at trial of that letter of apology.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.392" offset="415995">Louisiana trial court allowed prosecutors to introduce the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.092" offset="434803">Montejo was convicted by the jury and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.034" offset="450581">The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed. We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.852" offset="473882">In the case called Michigan versus Jackson, this Court held that “if police-initiated interrogation after a defendant's assertion at an arraignment or similar proceeding of his right to counsel, any waiver of the defendant's right to counsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="115.578" offset="568759">Montejo contends that this decision forbids police to approach any represented defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.448" offset="596240">The Louisiana Supreme Court however interpreted the precedent to mean that a defendant must have requested counsel or otherwise have invoked his Sixth Amendment rights in order to trigger the Jackson Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.643" offset="652978">In Louisiana, as in almost half of the 50 states, counsel is automatically appointed for indigent defendants and so Montejo did not make a specific request for a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.963" offset="706267">We agree with Montejo that the Louisiana Supreme Court's view of the Jackson Rule would produce an unworkable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.262" offset="739495">Preliminary hearings are often not transcribed or recorded, they tend to be rushed, and defendants do not always attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.703" offset="773245">It would be very difficult for courts to apply a request or invocation standard on a case by case basis attempting to divine after the fact whether a particular defendant expressed verbally or otherwise a desire for representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.034" offset="846597">Of course courts could decline to apply Jackson altogether to defendants in those states that appoint counsel without request, but that would surely lead to arbitrary results.1</text>
            <text syncTime="197.252" offset="895498">On the other hand, Montejo's reading of the case is untethered from the original rational of Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.411" offset="924129">Our case has make perfectly clear that the Sixth Amendment right not to interrogated without counsel can be waived, so long as the waiver is knowing and voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.026" offset="966552">We have further held that a defendant's waiver of his Miranda Rights including the Fifth Amendment right to counsel during interrogation also operates to waive his overlapping Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.723" offset="1029350">Jackson adopted a prophylactic exception to this principle designed to prevent the police from badgering defendants into waiving their previously asserted right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.201" offset="1079296">Jackson held that once a defendant has invoked his general right to counsel, a later waiver of counsel's assistance during interrogation will be presumed to have been unlawfully coerced unless the defendant initiated the contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.672" offset="1149095">Contrary to the dissent's view, that is the only coherent rationale for Jackson given our holdings that waivers our ordinarily permissible even by uncounseled and unrepresented defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.515" offset="1208550">Of course this antibadgering theory has no application to defendants like Montejo who have not yet expressed the desire for counsel but have been assigned counsel automatically by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.608" offset="1264870">Given that the Louisiana Supreme Court's approach to Jackson is impractical and Montejo's approach inconsistent with Jackson's rationale, we requested briefing on whether to overrule the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.372" offset="1315965">We now do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.030" offset="1322548">Jackson is not a venerable precedent, it was decided in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.999" offset="1342401">It was poorly reasoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.206" offset="1347312">Has created no significant reliance interest and as we have described is ultimately unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.137" offset="1378973">The benefits of the Jackson prophylactic rule are minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.024" offset="1394542">Because of the protections created by this Court in Miranda and related cases, there was little if any chance that a defendant will be badgered into waiving his right to have counsel present during interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.415" offset="1448145">Our cases hold that if a defendant requests counsel when he is first approached for interrogation and given his Miranda warnings, not only is the immediate interrogation without counsel forbidden but any later consent to interrogation without counsel will be deemed coerced if the police can initiated the contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.673" offset="1537170">This is enough prophylaxis to protect defendant's Fifth Amendment right from badgering an enough we think to protect his overlapping Sixth Amendment right as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.244" offset="1579384">Jackson however with respect to all defendants who have made a general request for counsel at arraignment prevents investigators from even seeking an uncounseled interview for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.851" offset="1629853">The considerable adverse effect of this rule upon society's ability to solve crimes and bring criminals to justice far outweighs its capacity to prevent a genuinely coerced agreement to speak without counsel present.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.917" offset="1686068">We therefore overrule Michigan versus Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.548" offset="1700592">Although we agree with the Louisiana Supreme Court's disposition of Montejo's Jackson claim, we remand the case so that Montejo can pursue any distinct arguments he may have about the validity of his Miranda waiver which takes on added important in light our decision today.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.606" offset="1768824">The judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.914" offset="1798081">Justice Alito has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Kennedy has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.251" offset="1819397">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="433.168" stopTime="581.280">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="433.168" offset="1839146">I have also filed a dissenting opinion that Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg have joined. Justice Breyer has joined all of that opinion except one footnote and he has also found a short dissenting statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.905" offset="1906019">The Sixth Amendment provides that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the assistance of counsel for his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.323" offset="1939769">In a long line of cases, the Court has held that such assistance must be available at every critical stage of the prosecution including those that occur outside the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.109" offset="1990865">Post-indictment, police-initiated interrogation whether or not it amounts to badgering is one such critical stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.642" offset="2029004">Until today, it was perfectly clear that if a defendant was represented by a lawyer, the police could not question him without giving notice to his lawyer and unless the lawyer was present and unless the defendant initiated the encounter.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.729" offset="2097340">That result was clear not only from our decision in Michigan against Jackson but also from the reasoning of earlier cases such as United States against Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.818" offset="2141748">As I explained at length in my dissenting opinion, the Court's decision to overrule Jackson is both unwise and unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.357" offset="2175916">It will however have only limited practical consequences because ethics rules governing the conduct of prosecutors in every state and in the Federal Government already prohibit them from directing their agents to interrogate represented defendants outside the presence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.661" offset="2253134">The Court's decision to overrule Jackson will therefore not affect the way most law enforcement agencies which mostly of course are thoroughly ethical, govern their -- in directions with represented defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.217" offset="2307260">It is only the rare unethical prosecutor whose conduct is endorsed by the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.898" offset="2334009">But that fact highlights the lack of justification for departing from the rule of stare decisis and diminishing the value of an important constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.885" offset="2378000">The decision to overrule Jackson is unsound and unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.178" offset="2395136">It can only have an adverse impact on the law enforcement profession in the rule of law itself.</text>
