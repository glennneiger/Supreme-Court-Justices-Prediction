            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Breyer has the opinion of the Court today in two cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="5.774" stopTime="270.336">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="5.774" offset="128564">The first case is called Polar Tankers versus City of Valdez, Alaska, and that city enacted an ordinance that imposed the personal property tax on the value of large ships that go back and forth to the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.710" offset="192303">Polar Tankers owns tanks -- oh that's logical, it owns tankers that transport crude oil from the Alaska Pipeline terminus that ends at Valdez to refineries in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.981" offset="241309">Polar filed this lawsuit in the state court and it said that what that tax is doing is it's imposing a fee on our ships for the privilege of entering the port.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.696" offset="288225">And for that reason, it violates, say, clause of the Constitution that not too many people had heard of which is Article I, Section 10, Clause 3, which forbids a State without the Consent of Congress to lay any Duty of Tonnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.327" offset="350710">We agree with Polar Tankers.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.867" offset="356874">It does violate this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.295" offset="362621">It does violate the Tonnage Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.975" offset="373279">Over the course of many years, the Court has consistently interpreted the language I just read to you in light of its basic purpose and that is it seeks to limit the coastal State's ability to obtain tax advantages based on their favorable geographic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.907" offset="449034">Say by charging a very high landing fee to ships and it seeks to prevent States from indirectly imposing otherwise forbidden taxes on imports and exports say by taxing the ship and not taxing the cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.853" offset="508803">So interpreting the Clause in light of this purpose, this Court, many years ago, unanimously concluded â€œa prohibition against tonnage duties has been deemed to embrace all taxes and duties regardless of their name or form and even though not measured by the tonnage of the vessel which operate to impose a charge for the privilege of entering trading in or lying in a port.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.618" offset="611934">In our view, the tax challenge here is a charge for the privilege of entering, trading in or lying in a port.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.992" offset="641400">The tax applies exclusively or almost exclusively to oil tankers.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.163" offset="662089">And oil tankers can be subject to the tax just based on coming once into the port.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.928" offset="685181">And the tax on the value of such vessels is closely correlated with its cargo capacity because the imposition of the tax depends on a fact that related the tonnage and the tonnage based tax is not for services provided to the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.642" offset="747980">It's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.988" offset="757384">Now, the city defends its tax in a part of the opinion that only has four votes on it and we talked about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.126" offset="781939">It appoints to language from earlier decisions that says taxes levied upon ships, as property, based on the valuation of the same as property are not within the Tonnage Clause prohibition, but -- and they say that's what we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.443" offset="843170">This Court later made clear that this exception comes into play only where their taxes property in the same manner as other personal property in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.445" offset="879219">And we think that means, in order to fund services by taxing ships, the ship must also impose similar taxes upon other businesses likely with the connection to the State, which will be a kind of check on a tax that say it's designed to soak the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.430" offset="947137">Here we can find few perhaps no other businesses on which the city imposes this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.887" offset="972946">The State does impose a somewhat similar tax on other oil-related businesses, but in the opinion, we explained why that fact doesn't really matter and doesn't save the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.515" offset="1015474">It's really basically because it doesn't stop the State by putting it more colorfully than the opinion from soaking the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.330" offset="1046716">For these reasons and those set forth more fully in our opinion, we hold that Tonnage Clause applies, the tax is invalid, we reversed the judgment of the Alaska Supreme Court to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.718" offset="1096244">The Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.770" offset="1124456">Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.985" offset="1145354">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Souter has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.389" offset="1166984">That's the first case and you now know more about the Tonnage Clause than many.</text>
