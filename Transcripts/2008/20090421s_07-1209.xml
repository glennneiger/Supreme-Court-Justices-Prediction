            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">The second case called Shinseki versus Sanders involves harmless errors, notice errors and veterans benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.913" offset="150068">Now when a veteran applies to the Department of Foreign Affairs for benefits, the Veterans administration has to help that veteran prepare the claim for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.303" offset="199701">And in doing that, the Veterans administration has to send the veteran some notices, various notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.162" offset="223107">Some tell the veteran for example “What information is missing?”</text>
            <text syncTime="33.496" offset="240452">“What additional information has to be provided”, and “Who is going to provide what?”</text>
            <text syncTime="38.954" offset="262290">“Which information the Veterans Administration will provide and which the veteran has to provide?”</text>
            <text syncTime="44.704" offset="285278">The law also says a Veterans Court and the Court of Appeals for this Federal Circuit when they review a veteran's benefit decision granting or denying the benefit, they have to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.966" offset="358316">And that means they have to apply ordinary rules of harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.091" offset="378796">Now, we here consider two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.853" offset="389872">In one of those cases, a Veterans Court found that a notice error of failure to give the right notice was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.436" offset="420174">And in the other case, it found that the notice error was harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.205" offset="439296">The Federal Circuit reversed the first decision and in doing that, it laid down a set of harmless-error rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.898" offset="470016">And in essence, those rules would find every such error harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.811" offset="489660">Unless the VA shows the veteran already knew the information or it just couldn't have been entitled to the benefit under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.186" offset="523201">Well, our job is in this case is to ask whether the rules that the Federal Circuit laid down, if you're still following this, we have to ask whether the rules that the Federal Circuit laid down are consistent with the law's ordinary civil case harmless-error rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.202" offset="599270">Our answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.295" offset="607629">They're not consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.289" offset="611600">They are too complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.939" offset="618183">They are too rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.277" offset="623512">They are too likely to make a lower court like the Veterans Court reach a long conclusion namely find an error it was harmful when it really isn't harmful after you read the record. That becomes obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.509" offset="664472">So, that's our final holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.802" offset="673667">And then we review the records in the individual cases, and in one case, we reverse the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.580" offset="696759">And then in the other, we vacate its decision and remand the case and we explained all this much more fully in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.241" offset="731449">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg joined.</text>
