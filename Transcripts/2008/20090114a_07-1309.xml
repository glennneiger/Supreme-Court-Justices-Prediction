            <text syncTime="1631.175" offset="6630128">The second point goes straight to the statute, that the relevant pattern of racketeering acts that is at issue in RICO -- this is 1962(c) -- is a pattern of acts committed by an individual defendant, not a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.668" offset="6688120">In fact, in H.J. this Court explained that the premise that the pattern has to be performed by a group or an association -- this is at page 244 of the Court's opinion there -- was wrong and that the pattern can be fully the work of an individual acting alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.528" offset="6755516">It's also wrong because an enterprise remains wholly distinct and pertinent in numerous RICO contexts under the government's interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.054" offset="13189684">The district court specifically charged the jury that they must find five separate elements of a RICO offense, including the existence of an enterprise as one; two, that the enterprise engaged in or its activities affected interstate or foreign commerce; three, that the defendant was associated in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.599" offset="13255826">Eventually you get down to five, that the defendant knowingly participated in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.589" offset="13519768">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.875" offset="13524888">Very briefly, nobody disputes the proposition that a properly instructed jury would be able to find that racketeering acts committed by an individual is a distinct element from the association-in-fact enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.884" offset="13584969">The government is absolutely right, and we agree on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.519" offset="13599493">The problem is the lower courts have misread Turkette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.638" offset="13611928">They're not focusing on the pattern of racketeering activity committed by the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.608" offset="13631885">They've -- and the instruction, as Justice Kennedy himself quoted in this case, encapsulate it -- encapsulates the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.398" offset="13666994">Common -- and this is at the bottom of JA 1111.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.516" offset="13679532">Common sense suggests that the existence of an associationin-fact is oftentimes more readily proven by what it does -- it does -- not rather than what an individual member does, rather than by abstract analysis of its structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.259" offset="13738465">So it only raises a further vagueness problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.211" offset="13750272">We agree that patterns of racketeering activity are properly committed by individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.365" offset="13770856">If you are going to define the enterprise solely or principally by virtue of the pattern, whose pattern would you define it by?</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.352" offset="13798860">It doesn't even make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.721" offset="13804293">And in Turkette, it -- with respect to what occurred in Turkette -- and this is at page 5 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.875" offset="13832923">The latter -- and this is a quote from Turkette, and it's referring to the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.343" offset="13846821">The latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.432" offset="13883183">We agree in the abstract that a properly instructed jury -- that the pattern and -- and the -- the enterprise are totally different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.954" offset="13917247">The problem is it's a giant circular argued by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.323" offset="13930726">Juries aren't being properly instructed in that regard, and that only compounds the vagueness of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.227" offset="13950370">A second point I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.096" offset="13957789">The government presses its principal definition of an enterprise in its brief, and what I hear here from the government is its common purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.600" offset="13987777">Common purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.683" offset="13992166">And I'd like to direct the Court to the Salinas opinion which discussed RICO conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.154" offset="14010034">It's at 522 U.S. -- well, I will give you the -- let's try 118 S. Court 477, it looks like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.525" offset="14051516">Common purpose is the hallmark of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.561" offset="14063637">And this is in the discussion of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.363" offset="14074922">We rejected argument X because it would erode the common law principle that so long as they share a common purpose, conspirators are liable for the acts of their co-conspirators, which is the Pinkerton doctrine which collapses 1962(c) into a general conspiracy statute, if you are going to define an enterprise principally by virtue of its common purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.962" offset="14161230">That's my second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.345" offset="14166768">As far as the -- the claim that somehow we didn't object sufficiently to the charge, I'm not going to address that in any depth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.300" offset="14198638">I would just direct the Court to pages 97 through 109 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.752" offset="14216401">It -- it spells out exactly what we objected to, and we objected to virtually every sentence of the instruction that defines or purports to define an association-in-fact enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.910" offset="14261018">As far as the definition of the enterprise, we would certainly agree with Justice Breyer's formulation that something to differentiate it as a long-term, goal-directed, decision-making apparatus that continues in the intervals between the predicate acts would do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.474" offset="14339281">But we contend that structure is largely -- it's a plain English word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.109" offset="14357880">It's not antidisestablishmentarianism or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.580" offset="14375748">The jury should be instructed, as in the Seventh and Eighth Circuits, that there's got to be a structure separate from the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.900" offset="14401034">If the jury has questions, we have lots of faith in district judges, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out; that if the jury comes back with a question, the judge could list examples tailored to the appropriate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.874" offset="14448891">And I just want to hit at the common -- the purpose underlying RICO here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.426" offset="14467176">It's very significant in my view that bank burglaries are not, in fact, RICO predicate acts, and if you were to look -- if this Court were to look at my -- my court of appeals briefs in this case, bank burglary is not a RICO predicate act for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.836" offset="14520780">Congress made a judgment that bank burglaries are adequately handled by the States, that the States can prosecute them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.907" offset="14545021">And the reason why these three bank burglaries had to be dressed up as interstate transportations of stolen money is because this is not really a case in which RICO is properly invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.613" offset="14583892">It's fully briefed in my court of appeals submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.814" offset="14596639">These are State crimes that a State is perfectly capable -- capable of handling on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.801" offset="14620672">And unless there are any further questions, I would waive any further rebuttal.</text>
