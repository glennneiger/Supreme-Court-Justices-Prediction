            <text syncTime="7.292" offset="134625">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are many reasons to reverse the Vermont Supreme Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.586" offset="159807">I am going to begin by addressing four reasons as a matter of law that do not require the Court to -- to review the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.396" offset="191049">The first is, even if we assume that the public defender is an assigned counsel -- and for the purposes of argument, I am just going to use the term "public defender".</text>
            <text syncTime="30.174" offset="226158">If we assume that public defenders do little or nothing in a case, one cannot have a rule that that time is chargeable under the speedy trial right to the State because to do so creates chaos of constitutional proportions in the criminal justice system.</text>

            <text syncTime="55.584" offset="327722">Your argument for the State, the position that you just took, would -- would apply to the period of time, as I understand it, in which the individual named, the defender named Sleigh, had been appointed to -- to represent the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.484" offset="387385">And as I understand it, when this case was argued in the Supreme Court of Vermont, the State conceded that, in fact, some prejudice should be attributed and it should be held against the State that Sleigh in effect did nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.898" offset="468992">They said, well, don't hold it against us quite as much as you might, but, in any case, that can be held against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.223" offset="494279">Here you don't take that position, and I -- I don't know whether it's open to you -- it seems to me that it's not open to you -- to take a different position with respect to Sleigh here than the Attorney General of Vermont did when it was before the Supreme Court of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.278" offset="574527">And I -- I have to assume that you just see it differently from the way the Attorney General did.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.385" offset="598977">But would -- would you comment on -- on the position that the State took and tell me why you can take a different position here?</text>

            <text syncTime="132.412" offset="635026">The State did take the position that the eight-month period, which included the four months where Attorney Sleigh was involved, was a neutral factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.159" offset="670030">And under the dicta in Barker, that would allow the Court to apply it against the State, although not to weigh it heavily as a -- as a neutral factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.990" offset="797403">But I don't think it should be binding because this Court is considering policy that's going to affect all States and all courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.986" offset="825407">And the issue that was raised by the National Governors Association, for example, as to whether public defenders can be State actors -- and the law is clear that they cannot -- that's an important issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.120" offset="901893">Yes, but also if you look at the record, the three years of delay, the time period involving Mr. Sleigh is approximately four months.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.274" offset="1378471">But the defender general took extraordinary measures and went to the Vermont Legislature and obtained funding, and the legislature came up to the plate very quickly, in a matter of weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.486" offset="1423402">The last withdrawal of Lawyer No. 5 happens on April 10th.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.130" offset="1989945">The comment is I -- I'm willing to accept a lot of what you say here, there is plenty of blame to go around.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.177" offset="2018158">But you accept, as I understand it, the proposition that the State has simply got an affirmative duty to make some kind of effective trial and representation arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.028" offset="2109482">If that, as it seems to be, is common ground, then do we have anything before us in this case, except sort of going through the list of counsel, the list of reasons, the list of delays and reviewing the Vermont Supreme Court on, in effect, the details that it assumed in applying the rule?</text>

            <text syncTime="739.319" offset="3062742">So the Supreme Court of Vermont says, as far as Mr. Donaldson is concerned, we do hold that against the State for the reason that it is the equivalent of not giving him anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="778.883" offset="3220940">It had to do with the fact that the State didn't give certain records to her, which everybody would agree, if it's true, should be chargeable to the prosecution, which is the State.</text>

            <label>Ms. Leondra R. Kruger</label>
            <text syncTime="1168.803" offset="4780659">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If you look on pages 27 through 28 of the Vermont Supreme Court's opinion, it is clear that the Vermont Supreme Court decided this case on the basis of a single principle that it applied to the entirety of the final two years of the pretrial delay in this case, and that is, as the Chief Justice has noted, that the failure of defendant's series of assigned counsel to move his case to trial should be attributable to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.635" offset="4887970">As the question comes before the Court today, I think the primary point of dispute is whether there should be an exception to the general rule that a defendant is responsible for his own lawyer's delays in situations in which the lawyer purportedly does little or nothing to move the case to trial; and for four reasons we think that the Court should decline to create a kind of attorney inaction exception to the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.033" offset="4981593">First of all, we think that such a rule would be inconsistent with the role of a lawyer in an adversarial system and would undermine a lawyer's authority to make day-to-day decisions about the scheduling of pretrial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.045" offset="5025583">Second, we think that such a rule would be enormously difficult for courts to administer in practice, because attorney inaction is generally difficult to discern in the midst of pretrial proceedings and the risk of error would be to deprive the defendant of the time that his lawyer may genuinely need in order to prepare an effective defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.300" offset="5102592">The third reason is that it would create opportunities for gamesmanship; it would create incentives for defendants to use the services of their lawyer so long as it suits them, but then to complain later that the lawyer was inactive and therefore they should not be held responsible for the lawyer's delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.482" offset="5163301">And as to the lawyers themselves, it would create an incentive to unreasonably delay, with the comfort of knowing that the worst that would happen is the best possible outcome for their client, which is the dismissal of charges with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.570" offset="5211679">And finally, we think that such a rule would create an unjustifiable distinction between the treatments of appointed counsel and retained counsel in our system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.723" offset="5244280">With respect to that last point, let me ask you this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.268" offset="5258491">Let's assume we -- we have paid counsel in a criminal case and, as a result of -- of delays by the prosecution, but primarily as a result of requests for continuance after continuance after continuance, the -- the case is not tried; it's a simple case and it's not tried for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.241" offset="5366429">Is -- is it open to a reviewing court on constitutional grounds to say that the State has got an affirmative obligation, a non-delegable obligation, to bring cases to trial in a reasonable time?</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.549" offset="5439572">And whether the reason for the failure in this three-year case is because counsel just kept trying to -- to shove it off, or the courts were not diligent in scheduling it for trial, at some point that non-delegable obligation has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.601" offset="5527865">Is -- is that a -- a possible constitutionally based position?</text>

            <label>Ms. Leondra R. Kruger</label>
            <text syncTime="1362.944" offset="5557227">I think that Barker makes clear that defendants can waive their right to a speedy trial and that indeed defendants will often desire to put off trial as long as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.562" offset="5599650">I think that in giving proper consideration to the Barker Court's explanation of the nature and purposes of the right, and in particular focusing on the fact that the only possible remedy for the speedy trial violation is a remedy that uniquely advantages defendants and poses substantial burdens on society, we think ultimately a defendant can't escape responsibility for continuances that he has requested through or without the assistance of counsel, simply by blaming the prosecution for failing to object or by blaming the courts for failing to go along.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.765" offset="5744473">Well, what if the -- what if we change the facts slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.609" offset="5755862">What if the defendant himself never says anything on the record?</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.061" offset="5773625">The only thing we've got on the record are repeated requests by paid counsel for continuances, and then after three years the defendant fires paid counsel and says: I've been sitting in jail for three years awaiting trial, and I shouldn't have to wait that long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.287" offset="5854605">The State has failed in its non-delegable duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.019" offset="5869547">Would your answer still be the same?</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.735" offset="5876339">It would still be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.987" offset="5881354">We think that fundamentally the principal safeguard against that kind of unreasonable attorney-caused delay is the attorney's ethical obligation, which creates a duty in the attorney to represent his clients with reasonable diligence and promptness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.155" offset="5938092">We think that a rule that would require--</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.762" offset="5944466">Lots -- lots of very effective criminal trial lawyers believe that the first tactic is delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.</text>

            <label>Ms. Leondra R. Kruger</label>
            <text syncTime="1467.494" offset="5975395">--And I think it's precisely for that reason, because a delay may ultimately be in the client's interest, that this Court should decline to fashion a rule that makes the exercise of the remedy, which is again an extreme remedy that advantages the defendant alone, exercisable at the option solely of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.502" offset="6047389">We think for that reason the defendant necessarily has to be responsible for any delays that are caused either by him or by the person who is appointed to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.245" offset="6082393">Again, the ethical duty of the lawyer is to zealously advocate on behalf of the defendant's interests, and if the defendant desires to go to trial as quickly as possible, it's still the lawyer's duty under the ethical rules to try to accommodate that request, while at the same time doing everything he can to prepare an effective defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1513.208" offset="6158252">Let me ask you this question about your reliance on pages 27 and 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.161" offset="6170060">If you describe it as delays by the lawyers themselves, I understand your comment as being right on the nose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.624" offset="6207885">But I understood part of that to be talking about the situation in which the defender general's office has not performed its duty with sufficient promptness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.667" offset="6252084">And would you not agree if there were a period, say, of seven or eight months in which they just didn't get around to appointing a lawyer, that that should be charged against the State?</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.287" offset="6290536">We would agree, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.023" offset="6297537">In this case there were a period of a total of about six months during which the Respondent was not represented at all, and we think in view of the State's ultimate responsibility for providing counsel to indigent defendants, when the State doesn't comply in a timely fashion with that duty, that delay is properly attributable to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.671" offset="6372143">Although in this case, because the delay was not the product of a deliberate effort to hamper the defense, we think that that period should weigh only lightly against the State; and ultimately, given the other factors at issue in this case, the absence of any actual trial prejudice in particular, we think that ultimately those six months are insufficient to establish a speedy trial violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.598" offset="6483843">I think that that's certainly one form of prejudice, but in the Barker balancing -- in Barker itself, for example, the defendant was incarcerated for ten months during the pretrial proceedings, and the Court nevertheless found that there was no speedy trial violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.514" offset="6543506">We think a similar principle applies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.201" offset="6554269">Although incarceration is obviously prejudicial to defendants, in this case there was no prejudice above and beyond that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.202" offset="7454239">And I -- I think if they're right, then that augurs a remand, that suggests a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.919" offset="7477123">But the reason there was no record of those departures is because the courts who presided over those departures never requested an explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.411" offset="7531039">With Paul Donaldson, the matter was a foregone conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.379" offset="7550892">He had no contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.690" offset="7556221">He was going into another line of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.314" offset="7566670">So be it, he's out of there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.564" offset="7575656">No questioning concerning Mr. Brillon's complaints about his inaction, his failure to investigate, and so forth; nothing about are you ready to go to trial, what have you done, what have you accomplished, what are you passing on, if anything, to the next lawyer in line, none of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.105" offset="7653815">And with Sleigh, the judicial disinterest, if that's what it was, the judicial silence is even more resounding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.145" offset="7694043">Sleigh did not request permission to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.708" offset="7712225">He put the court on notice that he was withdrawing, and this came out of the blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.189" offset="7738138">I don't think there was any heads-up for the court that this was going to happen, although Sleigh had expressed some serious reluctance to take the case and hadn't done anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.279" offset="7774501">He didn't -- he had a filing deadline of April 11th, and he was supposed to file motions on that date, and instead of filing motions he filed this notice of withdrawal with no response from the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2724.418" offset="11003131">I won't go over the circumstances of Donaldson's appointment, but once he was appointed, he began conversations with the defender general about getting off the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.584" offset="11063735">And I think the sense -- and -- and a significant fact about those conversations is that the defender general told Donaldson he was going to be replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.080" offset="11105740">We don't know exactly when that happened, but he told him he was going to be replaced with someone who was more competent, more qualified to deal with a life imprisonment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.263" offset="11154432">So this is not information which will light a fire under a lawyer to prepare a case, that he knows he's not going to try.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.069" offset="11197691">It's the only request he ever made of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.117" offset="11213887">The court gave him time and set filing deadlines, and he missed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.895" offset="11236979">Missing those deadlines should have been a red flag to the court in a case that was already over a year old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.000" offset="11265400">The court let those deadlines pass without a word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.890" offset="11284940">The court also said, we're going to try this case in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.573" offset="11303748">Get ready for trial in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.071" offset="11317750">Everything should be filed by September 23rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.380" offset="11326945">And for a reason, which the record has no explanation for, the October trial never happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.957" offset="11357247">Donaldson was still on the case, his name was still on the case, and the October trial date passed without a murmur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.843" offset="11384832">It was not until late November that Donaldson came to the court and explained the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.949" offset="11417224">Now the court -- I think the defender general failed in his responsibility with regard to Donaldson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.649" offset="11443973">That's State involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.524" offset="11451496">The court failed in not noticing the -- the missed deadlines and in allowing the trial date to pass without a trial; and I think the Court also failed in its duty in allowing Donaldson off the case, which rendered any catch-up time that he had to do pointless, without any inquiry at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.093" offset="11553792">The court, it's clear from the record, deferred entirely to the defender general, and so I think the Vermont court on that record thought that there was enough State involvement here to charge -- to find the State responsible and to weigh some of that responsibility against the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.368" offset="14090909">They said that most of the remaining two years, as of Donaldson's appointment in June of '02, was attributable to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.256" offset="14126435">It's not clear how much of that time or if they actually counted it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.610" offset="14163843">We argue, and the record supports, that much of that time had to do with Ms. Moore getting files together, not only from predecessor counsel but from the State, and that the State delayed for many months in providing an updated witness list with current addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.927" offset="14253077">She needed that to interview the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.380" offset="14262899">The case was old, and she needed the State's help there, with other discovery material which the record shows -- it's not in the joint appendix, but it is in the printed case, which was essentially Vermont Supreme Court's equivalent of an appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.747" offset="14324443">These materials were at issue for Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.106" offset="14345864">She needed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.073" offset="14349730">The prosecutor was dilatory in providing them.</text>
