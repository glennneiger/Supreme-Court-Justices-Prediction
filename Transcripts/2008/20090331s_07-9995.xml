            <text syncTime="9.860" offset="39421">A state trial court erroneously denied a criminal defendant's peremptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.421" offset="65648">Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, does that error require automatic reversal of the defendant's conviction even if all of the jurors actually seated are qualified and unbiased?</text>
            <text syncTime="32.093" offset="128341">That is the question this case presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.195" offset="140776">Petitioner Michael Rivera was charged with first-degree murder in an Illinois state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.922" offset="167630">During jury selection, Rivera attempted to use a peremptory challenge against perspective juror, Deloris Gomez.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.398" offset="201589">Concerned that Rivera's challenge was discriminatory on the basis of race or gender and is contrary to our decisions in Batson v. Kentucky and related cases, the trial court refused to allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.884" offset="267522">Because Rivera had no basis to challenge Gomez for cause, she was ceded on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.523" offset="298033">Following trial, the jury with Gomez as its foreperson found Rivera guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.908" offset="327604">The Supreme Court of Illinois held that the trial court erred in rejecting Rivera's peremptory challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.276" offset="353099">It further held, however, that the error was harmless and did not warrant reversal of Rivera's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.255" offset="384968">We affirm the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.916" offset="399597">A state trial court's good-faith but erroneous denial of a criminal defendant's peremptory challenge, we hold, does not require automatic reversal of the defendant's conviction provided that all person seated on the jury are qualified and unbiased.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.414" offset="481621">We have long recognized the peremptory challenges are not a matter of federal constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.989" offset="507953">States may withhold peremptory challenges altogether without impairing the constitutional guarantee of a fair trial before an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.144" offset="552570">Because the defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges is a matter of state law, a state court's mistaken denial of a peremptory challenge does not, without law, violate the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.916" offset="611607">In this case, the trial courts 02:34 reflected a good-faith, if arguably overzealous, effort to enforce our Batson-related decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.561" offset="654239">None of the jury seated including Gomez was incompetent, biased or otherwise removable for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.478" offset="685899">Rivera does receive all that is essential under the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.823" offset="707319">A fair trial before an impartial and properly instructed jury which found him guilty of every element of the charged offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.966" offset="743891">Absent a federal constitutional violation, States retain discretion to decide what happens when an error in applying state law affects the composition of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.379" offset="797494">They are free to decide, as a matter of state law, that a trial court's mistaken denial of a peremptory challenge is reversible error per se or they may conclude, as the Illinois Supreme Court implicitly did here, that the improper seating of a qualified and unbiased juror could rank as harmless error under state law.Our decision is unanimous.</text>
