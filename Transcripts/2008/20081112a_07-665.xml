            <text syncTime="9.022" offset="141521">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Tenth Circuit erred when it held that the First Amendment Free Speech Clause forces Pleasant Grove City to accept and erect on its property a private party's donated, unattended, permanent monument.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.163" offset="194079">The decision suffers from two constitutional defects: First, the court's conclusion that a donated Ten Commandments monument constitutes private speech rather than Government speech is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="235980">Here each of the monuments on display in Pioneer Park have been selected by the Government, are owned by the Government, controlled by the Government, and are displayed on Government property.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.993" offset="273387">When the Government is speaking, it is free from the traditional free speech constraints of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.795" offset="292613">Second, the court compounded its error by further concluding that Pioneer Park is a traditional public forum for the erection of permanent, unattended monuments by private parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3541.380" offset="14270945">With regard to the hypothetical about the Senator McCain or President-elect Obama signs, there is another factor that's important here; and that is those signs are created by those -- usually by the campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.403" offset="14311069">So the fact that it's created by a third party doesn't in any way diminish the speech aspect of an individual who has put that sign in their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.675" offset="14340117">Also with regard to the adopt the monument, governments don't adopt monuments; they adopt resolutions that accept monuments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.745" offset="14372404">That's the way it worked here; that's the way it works in most municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.714" offset="14384316">That's this -- the trigger of allowing the monument to be displayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.932" offset="14397168">Here there are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.616" offset="14399885">The city -- it was approached and made a formal acceptance, and it was noted later in their minutes as well, so in two different places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.653" offset="14427993">With regard to the adoption of the speech problem, Justice Alito, under the hypothetical or -- not hypothetical, the factual situation that you talk about, under the Tenth Circuit's theory, the case, in Respondent's theory of the case, al-Qaeda sympathizers could come in and say we want to erect a monument praising the value of the terrorists, and unless there's a compelling governmental interest, there would be no basis on which to deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.268" offset="14518481">That's why the whole public forum analysis on this, in our view is absolutely incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.153" offset="14534050">And finally on the adopt a speech, there are monuments and memorials that incorporate a variety of message, including Holocaust memorials, and they will often have in place Nazi-era propaganda, the signs from the Nazis that were designed to draw hatred towards Jews; and they will incorporate those into the monuments and the displays.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.199" offset="14606252">They are not adopting the message of the Nazis; they are showing the history of what took place during an era.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.753" offset="14624434">That's very, very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.219" offset="14630285">The Statute of Liberty, which was donated to the United States, was from the Franco-American Union, a private organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.608" offset="14655885">The United States -- and it's found in the appendix to our reply brief -- specifically accepted the monument, authorized the president to accept and they erected the pedestal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.797" offset="14696636">All privately funded in that regard, and it was originated by a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.766" offset="14712519">The Government was speaking when they erected that monument; the fact that the Antiquities Act came into play, which just means you cannot harm those monuments, it's no different than Pioneer Park, which is a national historic treasure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.974" offset="14757345">And last point, Mr. Chief Justice, if I man, is the reliance on Pinette is misplaced because as this Court said, Pinette is an Establishment Clause case, and the reliance here by the Respondent has been on the Free Speech Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.464" offset="14803320">We think the Tenth Circuit is wrong, both under the Government speech analysis and under the forum approach, and for that reason should be vacated.</text>
