            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="7.656" offset="138136">This case concerns the authority of police officers to stop and frisk a passenger in a motor vehicle temporarily seized upon police detection of a traffic infraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.997" offset="203442">In a pathmarking 1968 decision, Terry v. Ohio, this Court considered whether in the absence of a warrant to a course therefore, the police may temporarily stop an individual for questioning and frisk him or her for weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.364" offset="292885">Terry upheld stop and frisk as a constitutionally permissible police practice, one that does not violate the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures if two conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.956" offset="355265">First, the investigatory stop must be lawful, that requirement is met in an on-the-street encounter when the police officer reasonably suspects that the person apprehended is committing or has committed a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.394" offset="425064">Second, to proceed from a stop to a frisk, the officer must reasonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.195" offset="472294">Respondent Johnson was a passenger in an automobile stopped by Arizona police officers for a traffic violation warranting a civil citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.503" offset="521509">The officers had no reason to suspect any of the car's occupants of criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.945" offset="547213">During the traffic stop, one of the officers asked Johnson to exit the vehicle and he complied.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.275" offset="576575">Suspecting that Johnson was armed, the officer patted him down and discovered a gun near his waist.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.228" offset="608340">Charged with possession of a weapon by a prohibited possessor, Johnson moved to bluff the admission of the gun into evidence on the ground that police acquisition of the weapon was the proof of an unlawful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.055" offset="671660">The trial judge denied the motion and the jury convicted Johnson but the Arizona Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.734" offset="706456">Absent reason to believe Johnson was involved in criminal activity, the Arizona Appeals Court held the police officer had no right to pat him down for weapons, this was all the Court said, even if the officer had reason to suspect that the vehicle occupant was armed and dangerous and therefore, a threat to the officers' safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.640" offset="810005">The Arizona Supreme Court denied review.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.455" offset="821290">We voted to hear the case and now reverse the judgment of the Arizona Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.740" offset="850442">This Court has held that once a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, police officers without offending the Fourth Amendment may order all occupants out of the car, driver, and passengers alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.135" offset="915958">The very same concern for officer and public safety, the Court observed, justifies the exit order whether the occupant ordered out is the driver or a passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.416" offset="965172">For the duration of a traffic stop, we recently confirmed a police officer effectively and lawfully seizes everyone in the vehicle, the driver and all passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.071" offset="1023791">In a traffic stop setting, we accordingly hold the first Terry condition, a permissible investigatory stop is met whenever it is lawful for the police to detain an automobile and its occupants pending inquiry into the traffic violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.658" offset="1102054">To justify the stop, the police need not have an addition cause to believe any occupant of the vehicle is involved in criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.952" offset="1143327">To justify a patdown of the driver or a passenger during a traffic stop however, just as in the case of a pedestrian reasonably suspected of criminal activity, the police must harbor reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and therefore dangerous to the safety of the police and public.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.153" offset="1240085">Because it was reasonable for the police officer to suspect from what he observed while Johnson was still seated in the car that he was armed and dangerous, admission of his gun into evidence did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.450" offset="1309257">The Court's opinion is unanimous.</text>
