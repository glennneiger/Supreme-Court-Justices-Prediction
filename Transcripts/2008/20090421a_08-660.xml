            <text syncTime="154.796" offset="724574">The test proposed by Respondents and the government is active participation, which narrows -- narrows it somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.700" offset="748189">We point out in our opening brief that it's hard to conclude that the government did nothing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.976" offset="1009309">So there will be a whole series of legal determinations and possibly trips to this Court to determine the content of the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.646" offset="1040029">Secondly, there will be enormously difficult fact-gathering efforts for the -- that the relator and the defendant will have to undergo at the end of a case after judgment has been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.210" offset="1118292">Sometimes a docket sheet in a fully litigated qui tam action, declined or not, can be a hundred or 200 pages, and the case will have gone on for 5 or 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.249" offset="1158416">The standard would require -- the active participation standard would require the relator or the defendant to comb through the docket sheet to find every instance of government participation to see whether, if the docket sheet will review it, the participation was sufficiently active.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.874" offset="1320897">But also, I think it's a reflex among trained counsel always to see first, as soon as judgment is entered, how much time do I have to file the notice of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.660" offset="2884065">In that case, an amicus filing won't protect the government's interests and the government will have to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="713.122" offset="2957939">It's also true sometimes -- it's not at all fanciful that the relator might not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.292" offset="2986569">The relator might have spent a lot of money, time and money pursuing the trial, and, having lost, may have called it quits for purposes of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.814" offset="3024708">Or the defendant might say to the relator: Look, if you don't pursue your appeal, we won't file a bill of costs against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.568" offset="3059712">There could be all kinds of reasons why the relator might not appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.986" offset="11925358">The statute, 2107, was enacted after what is now FRAP 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.272" offset="11942494">The rule and the statute shortened the period to appeal from 3 months to 30 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.268" offset="12014488">The Judicial Conference raised some question about how we do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.470" offset="12027340">Two years later Congress enacted the statute putting in the 30-day and 60-day rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.272" offset="12046461">I think then that's a baseline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.124" offset="12053880">And I'm not sure that the advisory committee could come back and effectively amend the -- amend the statute by changing the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.897" offset="12085018">What Congress had in mind when it passed 2107 was if the -- if the -- the United States is a potential appellant and requires more time to conduct its internal decisionmaking processes, it gets 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.435" offset="12131203">Otherwise, that 30-day baseline governs, and I respectfully disagree, Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress was not concerned about moving appeals forward expeditiously.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.479" offset="12715301">And this Court will have to decide case by case: Is the United States a party for purposes of each rule of civil and appellate procedure?</text>
