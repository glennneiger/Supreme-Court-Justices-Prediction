            <text syncTime="8.593" offset="140769">After a private specialist diagnosed respondent with a learning disability, his parents placed him in a private academy that dedicated to students with special needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.605" offset="188834">Respondent's parents then requested an administrative hearing under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the IDEA, to determine whether respondent was eligible for public special education services.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.715" offset="253304">The hearing officer concluded that respondent was eligible and that the School District was wrong in failing to identify his disability and provide him with appropriate special-education services.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.602" offset="308893">Finding also that respondent's private school placement was appropriate, the hearing officer ordered the School District to reimburse respondent's parents for the cost of his private-school tuition.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.941" offset="362183">The District Court set aside the award, holding their recent amendments to IDEA categorically bar reimbursement unless a child has previously received public special education services.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.558" offset="420697">The Ninth Circuit reversed including that a court may order reimbursement if the School District has failed to meet its obligations under IDEA and the child has been placed in an appropriate private school.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.600" offset="476808">A child's previous receipt of public special-education services is not an absolute prerequisite for reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.832" offset="517768">We agree with the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.586" offset="528739">Several years ago, we held in a case called School Committee of Burlington that if provision of IDEA authorizing courts to award “appropriate” relief permits reimbursement for the cost of private-school tuition when a school district fails to provide adequate special-education services and the child's private school placement is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.411" offset="628109">Congress amended IDEA in 1997 adding provisions that elaborate on the circumstances in which reimbursement is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.726" offset="669383">The Amendments made no change to the central purpose of IDEA or to the text of the provision we construed in the Burlington case.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.941" offset="706163">Accordingly, we do not read the Amendments to abridge the authority of courts and hearing officers to award reimbursement in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.106" offset="746914">A contrary reading would be inconsistent with the text and purpose of IDEA and it would produce the absurd result of providing a remedy when a school offers a child inadequate special-education services that leave parents without a remedy when the school unreasonably denies access to such services altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.133" offset="834999">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Scalia and Thomas have joined.</text>
