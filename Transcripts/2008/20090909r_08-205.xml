            <text syncTime="24.504" offset="98210">Yet that is precisely the dialogue that the government has prohibited if practiced by unions or corporations, any union or any corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.420" offset="141783">The government claims it may do so based upon the Austin decision that corporate speech is by its nature corrosive and distorting because it might not reflected actual public support for the views expressed by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.353" offset="213567">The government admits that that radical concept of requiring public support for the speech before you can speak would even authorize it to criminalize books and signs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.555" offset="8558331">And so my question to you is, once we say they can't, except on the basis of a compelling government interest narrowly tailored, are we cutting off or would we be cutting off that future democratic process?</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.796" offset="8643281">Because what you are suggesting is that the courts who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with, not Austin or McConnell, but the fact that the Court imbued a creature of State law with human characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.194" offset="8752891">But we can go back to the very basics that way, but wouldn't we be doing some more harm than good by a broad ruling in a case that doesn't involve more business corporations and actually doesn't even involve the traditional nonprofit organization?</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.119" offset="8844633">It involves an advocacy corporation that has a very particular interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2248.933" offset="8995830">Citizens United happens to be sort of the paradigmatic example of the sort of group speaking no less about who to vote for or not who to vote for or what to think about a potential ongoing candidate for President of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.308" offset="9129368">And so we think it is not a matter of cutting off what legislatures can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.184" offset="9156849">They can still pass legislation doing all sorts of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.165" offset="9760800">And you're correct if you look at contributions, but this is an expenditure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.633" offset="9778668">And I think that it doesn't clarify the situation to say that for 100 years -- to suggest that for 100 years we would have allowed expenditure limitations, which in order to work at all have to have a speaker-based distinction, exemption from media, content-based distinction, time-based distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2467.357" offset="9869574">Well, I think Justice Stevens was right in saying that the expenditure limits that are in play in this case came into effect in 1947, so it has been 60 years rather than 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.854" offset="9911579">But in fact, even before that the contribution limits were thought to include independent expenditures, and as soon as Congress saw independent expenditures going on Congress closed what it perceived to be a loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.457" offset="9961943">So in fact for 100 years corporations have made neither contributions nor expenditures, save for a brief period of time in the middle 1940's, which Congress very swiftly reacted to by passing the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
