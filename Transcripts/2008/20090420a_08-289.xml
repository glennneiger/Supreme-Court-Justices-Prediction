            <text syncTime="3033.789" offset="12240603">That was complete dissolution of the court's immediate orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.975" offset="12253351">It was not to just limit those orders just to Nogales; it was not to improve -- or to approve improvements in Nogales as an interim measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.229" offset="12282295">As a result, the burden was on them to show either full compliance with the orders the district court had entered or material changed circumstances that made compliance unnecessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.625" offset="12371947">To the extended we are talking about the question of whether conditions had changed in Nogales that there was no longer an ongoing violation of Federal law, the district court held an 8-day evidentiary hearing, and it made factual findings showing that the problems had not ceased in Nogales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.219" offset="12430252">And as you noted, Justice Ginsburg, this changed circumstances argument that is now heavily relied upon by Petitioners was not the primary thrust of their argument before the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.574" offset="12467764">The primary thrust of their argument was that HB 2064, which is the State's scheme for ELL education, had some serious -- would -- would satisfy the judgment; and their other argument was that No Child Left Behind completely preempts -- that was the language they use -- completely preempts and renders obsolete the EEOA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.940" offset="13285188">That's right, if the State had changed its plans or that Nogales otherwise would have sufficient funding from circumstances that -- or from other source, that would be one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.463" offset="13319252">But the district court found that Nogales doesn't have that funding from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.581" offset="13335761">For example, it can't use the federal funding that it -- that the Petitioners claim could be used to solve its problem under the EEOA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.271" offset="13370556">There are specific conditions on federal grant programs that forbid that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.723" offset="13384349">It also could not raise any significant amounts of funding through county tax overrides, which was another source the Petitioners had said would -- would provide sufficient funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.345" offset="13422801">So the question the district court had to ask is, there has been an ongoing violation of federal law, has that violation of federal -- federal law ceased because the State has put in place, Nogales has put in place programs that are reasonably calculated to help these kids learn English?</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.271" offset="13478494">And the district court said Nogales has cobbled together these sources of funding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3609.373" offset="14542932">And the district court said there are three things wrong with it, the two years, using the federal funds to -- to supplant not supplement, and that the $450 figure wasn't enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.821" offset="14632688">I think the problem with the $450 figure is that the district court was never told what the State was planning to buy with that, what that $450 was for.</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.085" offset="14721714">Do you think that the constitutional -- State constitutional provision at least there has to be equivalent funding in districts, do you think that would be called into play if the Federal Government under a federal program gave additional funds to a particular district?</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.315" offset="14798723">Which I am sure it does, those districts that have federal facilities probably get additional -- additional money, would all the rest -- under this constitutional provision, would all the rest of the State have to belly up to that -- to that same level?</text>

            <text syncTime="3808.104" offset="15337785">The Ninth Circuit simply applied the wrong 60(b)standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.889" offset="15360982">It, in fact, used this remarkable language, but it also of radical change, but it also gave undue weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.893" offset="15388985">It said it ten times to the fact that the original judgment was on appeal, and then it simply did not pay heed to the incredibly intrusive nature of a statewide funding remedy in light of the fact that we can now look at what has happened in Nogales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.187" offset="15462128">We see the changes that have, in fact, been there, and certainly the EEOA by its design in section 1712 of EEOA makes it very clear that the remedial reach of the EEOA is quite limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.097" offset="15517821">It's limited to particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.899" offset="15529002">Here the EEOA has been transmogrified to apply statewide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3862.203" offset="15554184">It should not have been done in the first instance but certainly in light of the changed circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.523" offset="15575500">And the changed circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, go back to structured English immersion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.593" offset="15599741">They did not begin with the passage of HB 2064.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.962" offset="15617296">Structured English immersion came in in the year 2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.414" offset="15635059">That is why the legislature then came in and put these facts in evidence before the district court, which made no factual findings statewide at all, ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.305" offset="15686677">There are no statewide factual findings in this record whatsoever, none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.476" offset="15711336">And therefore statewide funding remedy should not have been permitted.</text>
