            <text syncTime="1572.069" offset="6394692">It's arguing that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury in this case interpreted the accomplice liability charge in the same manner that the State itself urged the jury to interpret it; that the State urged the Washington Court of Appeals to interpret it on direct review in this case and in many other cases, and how the Washington Court of Appeals in fact interpreted it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.027" offset="6858522">And remember, the jury instruction in this case simply tracks that language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.329" offset="6879734">Now, our response to that argument is, just as you said, Justice Alito, when a State supreme court, as the Washington court later did in this case, steps in and applies a gloss to that language and interprets it, as this Court has said many times, it's as though that language is written into the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.523" offset="8304556">In joint appendix page 38, the prosecutor makes her opening argument and says -- and uses the assault analogy of holding somebody's arms behind their back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.712" offset="8349278">And she tells the jury this is -- as Justice Ginsburg was reading -- this is the law of the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="2244.082" offset="9082796">So, then, what I take is authoritative on that are two sentences from the Washington Supreme Court opinion, though people -- other judges have been all over the lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.890" offset="9126055">The first sentence it says: The trial court correctly instructed the jury that it could convict Mr. Sarausad of murder -- they mean second-degree murder -- as an accomplice only if it found he knowingly aided in commission of "the crime" charged, which was second-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.851" offset="9197840">That's their interpretation, which I could understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.053" offset="9214663">Then the second thing is, it does not offend the principles of accomplice liability to hold responsible one who knowingly aids such conduct; namely, conduct that creates a substantial risk of death when the substantial risk of death results in actual death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.650" offset="9297000">So that would seem to be hornbook law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.501" offset="9308494">If you engage in conduct that might well cause substantial or -- substantial risk of death and you know it, you know, you know you're engaging in this conduct, that's the Washington view, that's it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.111" offset="9370875">And here they go on to say that he knew there was plenty of evidence that he knew that he was engaged in a drive-by shooting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2767.853" offset="11177817">But remember two things, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.257" offset="11191505">First, the prosecutor herself kept telling the jury this is what the State of Washington law requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.245" offset="11215433">And as this Court has recognized in other cases, the prosecutor isn't just any old lawyer standing in front of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.697" offset="11237272">The prosecutor carries with her the imprimatur of the government; and so we think it's perfectly reasonable for the jury to have understood the prosecutor to be arguing this is what the law is, and at the very least to have created a question in their minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.372" offset="11295890">And if I contrast this case with Brown against Payton, because Justice Breyer has asked about that case and it is another case where the prosecutor made what this Court found was a misleading argument to the jury, there you have a very different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.966" offset="11350329">Not only do you have no jury questions at all coming in that case to demonstrate to the Court that the jury was in fact confused and likely to follow the prosecutor's advice, but you have a very different scenario in Brown, where this Court said that in light of the way that case was actually argued, the prosecutor was really making more of an argument on the facts, that these arguments the defendant has made shouldn't really be considered mitigating evidence in your deliberations; and as this Court said the jury must have taken it as a factual argument because otherwise the whole mitigation hearing would have been totally unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.091" offset="11502780">Now, under the -- under the facts of this case, the way this case was tried -- and again I want to emphasize that at the time this case was tried, the prosecutor had the better of the argument as to what Washington law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.447" offset="11548233">This case is only before you because it's the oddball case, and the only one I can think of that's like it is when this Court had in about 2000, or decided in 2001, called Fiore v White, when in Pennsylvania the State brought a prosecution and obtained a conviction for discharging hazardous waste without a permit, and then the Pennsylvania Supreme Court later said that not having a permit is required under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.132" offset="11658992">It's not enough to prove to the jury that he so deviated from the permit that -- that no permit existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.620" offset="11684906">And then this Court said once we know that clarification under State law, we look back and it's clear as day that the jury didn't find that element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.559" offset="11716671">Now the only difference between that case and this case is that in Fiore it was absolutely certain the jury didn't find the element and the prosecution didn't argue otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.081" offset="11750734">Here you have enough ambiguous evidence and ambiguity in the jury instructions that the State was trying to backfill after it has lost the case in the Washington Supreme Court and say no, the jury in this case even though we told them they didn't have to find it, did go ahead and find it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.222" offset="11931293">So we are on all fours with Fiore in the sense that the later decision from the State Supreme Court applies retroactively, and in Fiore what you would have had, the court didn't need to talk about jury instructions, because I take it that the jury was instructed in Fiore that deviating substantially from a permit satisfies the no-permit element of that defense, and so the jury was given there, simply an instruction that was simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.968" offset="12022303">And here our contention is that the -- that the jury charge taken in light of the case was ambiguous, but that distinction doesn't matter because as this Court has said in Boyde and Estelle and many other cases, all you have to show is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.513" offset="12088445">Now we have to show an additional layer of unreasonableness because we are on habeas now and no longer on direct review, but for all the reasons that are apparent on the face of this record this is the extraordinary case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.007" offset="12806499">And so my point, Mr. Chief Justice, is the reason why the State cannot show that the State court of appeals decision was reasonable is because it's not just the instruction that had perplexed the State and Washington courts over the years; it's the fact that the prosecutor asked the jury to adopt the wrong interpretation of the instruction and that the jury came back and told the court -- I think -- maybe it helps to think about the case this way: After seven days of deliberation -- now I understand that we can dispute a little bit what the jury was asking, but I think a fair statement is that after seven days of deliberation, the jury was telling the court at a minimum there's a reasonable likelihood we don't understand accomplice liability in this case and that we are going to find that as long as Sarausad was a member of this gang and willingly participated in gang activity, that that's enough to hold him liable for accomplice murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.010" offset="13022480">And that's what the State had argued alternatively, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.046" offset="13034600">So after seven days, there's no guesswork that's even required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.764" offset="13049543">We know the jury was confused and going down the wrong path.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.866" offset="13061872">And so the only way the State can rescue that is to say that, upon being told to read the same charge that it been told to read three previous times, that suddenly the light bulb went off so dramatically that it reduced its confusion below the 50/50 level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.577" offset="13136792">Now that's what this Court said in Brown against Payton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.963" offset="13146300">The reasonable likelihood test is below 50/50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.065" offset="13154659">So we think if you were the Washington Court of Appeals -- and I think this is another way to ask yourselves the question you have to decide in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.552" offset="13176602">If you were the Washington Court of Appeals on this record, would it be reasonable for you to say that this jury was not even reasonably likely to misunderstand the accomplice liability instruction in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.628" offset="13352981">I think it is fair to say that the jury's third question is perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.532" offset="13372520">I hedged a minute to be frank so that I could acknowledge the Court's earlier questions and get -- and get my statement out, but in all honesty, I think that the third jury question makes it clear that the jury is confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.606" offset="13424870">But we have -- again, unlike Brown against Payton, unlike Weeks against Angelone, we have this amazing constellation of all these mutually--</text>

            <text syncTime="3341.247" offset="13471472">The statement is -- the prosecutor never suggested Mr. Sarausad could be found guilty if he had no knowledge that a shooting was to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.920" offset="13506163">You're saying that's absolutely wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.588" offset="13520792">In fact what the prosecutor was arguing is that, even if a shooting didn't occur, he's still guilty because of other gang activity, and when we read the record, we find that's so wrong the statement in the supreme court opinion, that habeas was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.062" offset="13574708">Is that the argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.392" offset="13664047">I want to just focus for a moment on the third question because Respondent focuses on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.329" offset="13691737">To begin with, you have to understand what was going on in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.864" offset="13705947">There was deliberation for seven-plus days but it was a 10-day trial, I mean the jury heard testimony for 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.553" offset="13748684">There were three defendants being tried together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.021" offset="13762476">Each defendant was being tried on five counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.492" offset="13776374">It was a complicated trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.125" offset="13782956">The fact that the deliberations took seven days is not extraordinary at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.146" offset="13803018">Mr. Sarausad assumes that the third question is directed at him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.864" offset="13825902">I suggest -- of course we don't know what was going on in the jury room, but I suggest as likely an explanation is that question went to Mr. Reyes because Mr. Reyes was not driving, was sitting in the back seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.191" offset="13875221">The question is, if you're just sitting in the back seat when your gang is going to do an activity, are you guilty?</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.510" offset="13900507">And they were told to reread the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.379" offset="13912001">They did reread the instruction, and they deliberated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.331" offset="13923809">So the third question came on the seventh day of deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.366" offset="13939900">After they got the answer to reread the instruction, they deliberated about 45 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.668" offset="13957141">They took a break for the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.270" offset="13963515">They came back, deliberated about another hour and a half, and then they pronounced their verdict, convicted Mr. Ronquillo of first degree murder, Mr. Sarausad of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.392" offset="14004057">They hung on Mr. Reyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.926" offset="14010117">It seems to me that the third question does not -- is not some kind of a smoking gun.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.055" offset="14090679">We suggest it's just as likely that it's a question about Mr. Reyes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.859" offset="14105830">But what he's saying, I think now, is if there was no gun in the car -- suppose the jury thinks there's no gun in the car, then he didn't even know there was going to be a shooting, but that the prosecutor in the context of the trial had given the jury the impression that they could convict this person even if the person did not know there was going to be a drive-by shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.475" offset="14204364">And he's saying that the finding to the contrary, the statement to the contrary in the Supreme Court of Washington is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.228" offset="14231322">When I look at that, I will find, he says, that the prosecutor gave the impression, as I just said, that even without a gun your involvement with this gang is enough to convict him of murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.376" offset="14315959">The prosecutor -- and the PRP court stated the prosecutor never argued that if the only knowledge was some kind of a fight, that you could convict him, because the defendants in this case testified that they were going to go fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.700" offset="14373219">And you never had the prosecutor saying: This is an easy case; I win.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.504" offset="14388475">The defendants have all testified that they were going to go fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.187" offset="14399237">In for a dime, in for a dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.688" offset="14405193">If they were going to go fight, they're guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.304" offset="14411672">Never argued that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.488" offset="14416374">You will not find that in the transcript or in the materials, Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.175" offset="14431107">What you will find is the prosecutor consistently arguing they knew they were going to facilitate a homicide, a shooting, a murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.948" offset="14466215">And given that this is a case brought under AEDPA and the question is whether the PRP court's decision is an unreasonable application of Federal law, I don't think there's any doubt that it's not an unreasonable application, and, therefore, this Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit.</text>
