            <text syncTime="24.031" offset="201498">Neither equal protection nor Title VII justified New Haven's race-based scuttling of the promotions Petitioners earned through the civil service process mandated by Connecticut law.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.606" offset="251862">The lower court required no strong evidentiary basis that the City was acting to remedy or avoid any actual discrimination, but strong safeguards are needed to smoke out illegitimate uses of race and to extinguish the racial favoritism that civil service laws -- excuse me -- are intended to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.722" offset="344336">Governmental employment actions grounded in race must be strictly scrutinized because they engender divisiveness and cause race-grounded harm that the Constitution seeks to avert.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.907" offset="669090">And let's take for one example a test that's given by a police department, a fire department, and it -- it's a physical fitness test, and it disproportionately excludes female applicants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.962" offset="10929256">When an employer learns that a practice has a severe adverse impact such that it creates an inference of discrimination, and evidence further supports that inference, the employer should be granted some limited degree of flexibility to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.043" offset="11005639">An employer certainly should not be encouraged or forced to make a promotion on the basis of the questionable practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.981" offset="11041374">Title VII's disparate impact provisions are designed to remove structural barriers to discrimination, and when an employment practice has an adverse impact such that it substantiates an inference of discrimination, an employer should look beyond that adverse impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.821" offset="12900665">One is a racial classification which makes different decisions based on different individuals on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.142" offset="12925952">Cases like Croson or Wygant or even affirmative action plans are examples of making different distinctions based on different individuals on the basis of race.</text>

            <text syncTime="3225.120" offset="13005887">Here the Petitioners argue that there is an adverse impact on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.691" offset="13024172">Of course, that depends on the assumption that there was, in fact, a valid test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3246.633" offset="13091986">However, the answer to your question is: Compliance with a Federal statute, even a race conscious Federal statute, cannot be deemed a discriminatory purpose under the Arlington -- Arlington Heights inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3834.658" offset="15444052">--But the -- but the point is that that ties the hands of employers so that the employer, in fact, is limited in what it can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.412" offset="15475085">Just because a test has been administered doesn't mean that Title VII's disparate impact provisions suddenly disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.668" offset="15504133">And as a number of lower courts have stated, there's no entitlement to be promoted on the basis of a flawed or discriminatory test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.505" offset="15535480">The problem is, the alternative is to force employers to go forward and to use a discriminatory or a potentially discriminatory test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.563" offset="15575709">That has two problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.729" offset="15580306">First, it's inconsistent with the goal of merit-based selection; and second of all, if it turns out that there is, in fact, discrimination, a court then needs to undo that discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.536" offset="15627536">A court will often need to use racial quotas or set-asides to try to undo or to remedy the discrimination that has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.059" offset="15661704">So it's much better for an employer to stop, to not go forward with discrimination, even after the test has been used, rather than to rush forward and to create potentially further discrimination and a more aggressive use of race down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.652" offset="15723980">Another problem with creating a high standard is it will discourage employers from removing barriers to equal opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.258" offset="15758461">For example, with respect to an ongoing practice, if an employer learns that that practice has a disparate impact, but is not sure one way or another, and gets rid of that provision, under Petitioners' theory that employer will necessarily be liable to either blacks or whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.505" offset="15839441">The only way that it can defend against a lawsuit by whites would be to argue that it was, in fact, violating the disparate impact rights of black Americans.</text>
