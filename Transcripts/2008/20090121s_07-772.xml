            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Thomas has our opinion this morning in case 07-772, Waddington versus Sarausad.</text>

            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="8.146" offset="138992">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.860" offset="165846">As part of the gang dispute, respondent, Cesar Sarausad, drove his car by Seattle high school in a manner that allowed one of his passengers to shoot and kill one student and wound another.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.672" offset="225092">The gunman was tried for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.848" offset="233869">Sarausad and another member of their gang, his co-defendant, were tried as accomplices.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.682" offset="265216">At trial, Sarausad and the co-defendant testified that they did not know they were helping the gunman to commit murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.968" offset="306280">They claimed that they thought that they were going to the high school just to provoke a fist fight with the rival gang.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.947" offset="338254">The jury was instructed in the language of the relevant Washington statute regarding accomplice liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.315" offset="371691">Specifically, the instruction stated that in order to find the defendant guilty as an accomplice in the commission of the crime, the jury must find that the defendant took certain specified actions with knowledge that they would promote or facilitate the commission of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.922" offset="462179">The jury convicted the gunman of first-degree murder and Sarausad of second-degree murder, but failed to reach a verdict as to their co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.419" offset="512125">Sarausad's conviction was affirmed on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.076" offset="530725">Then, in an unrelated criminal case, the Washington Supreme Court considered an accomplice liability instruction that was different in one critical respect from the instruction given at Sarausad's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.402" offset="596031">It instructed jury that knowledge of a crime was sufficient to establish accomplish liability for the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.719" offset="641275">The Washington Supreme Court held that the instruction was flawed because accomplish liability in Washington requires knowledge of the crime of conviction rather than just general knowledge that a crime may occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.572" offset="712746">In state postconviction proceedings, Sarausad relied on that recent Washington Supreme Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.411" offset="744093">He argue that his jury may have been confused by the instruction if received and may have thought it could convict him for murder based only on his anticipation of a fist fight with the rival gang.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.237" offset="811384">The state courts denied his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.786" offset="821624">They found that the jury instruction in his case was a proper and clear statement of Washington law.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.613" offset="856942">They also concluded that nothing at Sarausad's trial could have led the jury to believe that it could convict him based on something less than his personal knowledge of a shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.566" offset="912739">In federal habeas proceedings, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a Federal District Court's decision overturning Sarausad's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.549" offset="960596">The Court of Appeals held that the state court decision affirming Sarausad's conviction was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.820" offset="1009706">In the Court's view, the accomplice liability instruction used at Sarausad's trial were ambiguous and may have misinterpreted in a way to permit conviction based on knowledge of an assault rather than the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.801" offset="1089640">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.352" offset="1115867">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), federal courts must give substantial deference to state court decisions upholding criminal convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.780" offset="1169575">Therefore, federal habeas relief is available only where the state court's application of federal law was objectively unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.253" offset="1211476">Under our President to challenge a conviction based on a jury instruction, a defendant must show, one, that the instruction is ambiguous, and two, that there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.510" offset="1276468">The state court was not unreasonable when it found that neither requirement was established in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.702" offset="1305203">The instruction quoted the state statute verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.324" offset="1319727">By its terms, the instruction required that accomplice liability for the crime be based on knowledge of the crime not a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.537" offset="1360583">The state court reasonably concluded that there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.803" offset="1393706">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens and Ginsburg have joined.</text>
