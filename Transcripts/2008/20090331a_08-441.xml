            <text syncTime="1092.589" offset="4475758">And there is the procedural posture, which is Desert Palace left unresolved a lot of very difficult and complicated questions about when do you get to the jury on mixed motives and what is the requirement that separates a mixed motive motivating factor instruction from the "but for" or commonly known as the McDonnell Douglas?</text>

            <text syncTime="1151.461" offset="4711278">I think what would be on the table if this Court ever had an appropriate vehicle -- and this certainly is not the appropriate vehicle to get into this question -- there would be several options on the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.567" offset="4747640">You could have what your view suggests, which is after summary judgment you could get a motivating factor instruction, that the jury would be permitted to find both impermissible and permissible motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.589" offset="4787764">You could also have a special verdict form that asks the jury: Do you find that there were two causes, one of which was an impermissible factor?</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.677" offset="4816081">And you could have a situation which I think prevails in trial courts now -- and has been the EEOC's practice -- which is -- and it's not the most analytically clean, but they basically give the instruction, either a determinative cause or motivating factor instruction, on what they think best fits the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.288" offset="4882536">And I think it's important for the Court to understand, as we -- the law exists now under Title VII and under all the other anti-discrimination acts, there are two regimes out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.477" offset="4919317">There's a mixed motive regime and a determining factor regime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.141" offset="4994027">And the first is that it wasn't pressed or passed on below or raised in the brief in opposition and did not receive full briefing by the parties and all the amici.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.410" offset="5539046">You did it in the recent crack cocaine case in Spears, you did it in your nude dancing case, and you did it in a case called Jefferson v.

            <text syncTime="1378.490" offset="5619399">Since Desert Palace, there is the decision of Sprint/United v. Mendelsohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.792" offset="5640610">And I think that case a fortiori forecloses all the arguments made by the other side that, well, even if it doesn't mean non-circumstantial evidence, it must mean something that is highly relevant to the issue of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.868" offset="5692855">In Sprint/United, you said: We're not going to have a per se rule about what's relevant to prove discrimination.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="1704.033" offset="6921550">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It does seem to me in some ways the Petitioner and Respondent in this case are ships passing in the night because the issues here are unbelievably complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.175" offset="6970138">I will say in 25 years of advocacy before this Court I have not seen one area of the law that seems to me as difficult to sort out as this particular one is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.197" offset="7002216">That said, I would hope that the Court would seize upon this as an opportunity to provide some significant clarity in the law, rather than seize this as an opportunity to decide this case on the potentially most narrow ground, which, frankly, as far as I can tell, will not only not decide this case, ultimately, but certainly will not do anything to resolve the mass confusion that seems to exist among the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.460" offset="7095212">So, I would urge the Court not to evaluate this case strictly on the question of whether direct versus circumstantial evidence is the appropriate way to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.716" offset="7124261">In part that's because that's not the basis on which the Eighth Circuit decided this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.620" offset="7143905">The Eighth Circuit said that it interpreted Justice O'Connor's separate opinion calling for direct evidence as talking about a specific link between the proof -- in the proof of the discriminatory considerations and the adverse action that was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.047" offset="7209629">So, direct versus circumstantial doesn't even -- you know, if you remand to -- to evaluate non-circumstantial evidence, you are still not going to be in a position where that's going to affect the outcome.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="1786.871" offset="7252888">As I understand the court of appeals, it said that Justice O'Connor's opinion was the controlling opinion, it was the decision on the narrowest ground; therefore, the lower courts ought to take that decision as the law made by Price Waterhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.649" offset="7324045">Then there's a question of what did she mean by "direct evidence"?</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.951" offset="7341181">But I think the Eighth Circuit certainly did say Justice O'Connor's opinion states the law of Price Waterhouse, and that was the basis on which their decision turned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.896" offset="7412966">But there's no question, Justice Ginsburg, that that is the basis for that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.716" offset="7428326">So, I mean, I suppose the Court could say, no, we disagree with the basis of Price Waterhouse as Justice White's separate concurring opinion, which, frankly, I think it is -- you know, having read it more times than I care to admit, is not exactly clear as to what he thinks the appropriate standard would have been.</text>

            <text syncTime="1867.723" offset="7576283">And, therefore, the lower courts have seized upon an opinion that at least provided serious guidance that they could embody into -- into a jury instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.429" offset="7611183">It goes to the point that Justice Alito was making, which is that, you know, it's one thing when you are dealing with bench trials and what do you ask the judge to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.101" offset="7641799">It's something fundamentally different when you are shifting the burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.300" offset="7738661">The case is tried on that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.933" offset="7745139">The basis for the judgment that there's going to be no evidence of age discrimination in this case is the discovery, extensive discovery that has taken place, where there is no statements by anyone talking about age, no other employee who believes that he or she had been ever been affected by age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.143" offset="7801981">It's all of this very abstract claim and the notion that somehow there's no better explanation for what happened except for age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.666" offset="7828104">You go through the entirety of the trial saying to the jury, there's no evidence of age, there's no evidence of age discrimination, and then at the last minute, not because you have asserted an affirmative defense -- because we didn't assert an affirmative defense -- one is foisted on us by the jury instruction that the plaintiff asked for in this particular case, that says that if there is a motivating factor, if you can prove a motivating factor -- which it's interesting to get to the specifics of a motivating factor, which means it played a part or a role, which is about as minimalist as you can have it -- then the burden shifts, and we then have the burden to prove that we would have taken the same action notwithstanding age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.922" offset="7981077">Well, that's a very different inquiry, and when you go to the jury at the end, you can't concede--</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.266" offset="9386465">It said it in Burdine, it said it in Reeves, it said it in Hazen Paper, it said it I think last term in a Kentucky case, where it says it has to play a role and be determinative.</text>

            <text syncTime="3054.739" offset="12324404">But it seems to me that under -- under normal civil litigation rules, and the ones that Congress clearly had in its mind, the approach you would take under those circumstances say that's enough to get you to the jury, but that's not enough to force the jury to be instructed that they have to rule in favor of the plaintiff unless the defendant can show that but for -- that -- that no matter -- regardless of the discriminatory animus, they nevertheless would have taken precisely the same action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.139" offset="12429939">That, to me, is the guts of -- of what -- of what this case is about.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.550" offset="13015604">Isn't it true that by the time the case gets to the jury, everything is mixed motive, because there is going to be the claim that this was -- and this is a great illustration of that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.906" offset="13049041">There's a claim that age was the basis for the decision, and then there's a claim that there are any of a thousand other possible reasons that are out there, and age just didn't happen to be one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.495" offset="13083418">And under those circumstances the question is: What's the reasonable way to proceed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.364" offset="13098883">Now, Justice Ginsburg, I apologize that we didn't raise this specifically in the brief in opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.868" offset="13120930">On the other hand, the reality is that the primary position that was taken by the other side was that this Court essentially can ignore or should overrule a portion of Price Waterhouse as a consequence of the -- of the intervening Costa decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.293" offset="13178608">And it seems to me under those circumstances, if you are going to put the issue of the validity of Price Waterhouse -- whatever it means -- at issue, then it seems to us a reasonable response on the merits to say, well, you shouldn't do it as -- as a -- in isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.870" offset="13232943">That that's a completely artificial inquiry, and you ought to take a step back and say, maybe we haven't gotten this right in the first place, particularly given the difficulty of the lower courts in trying to figure out exactly what Price Waterhouse means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.928" offset="13285083">Whose is the controlling opinion, and how do you allocate these burdens and under what circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.581" offset="13303787">And given that the lower courts are in disarray, it would seem to me this is a situation where I don't know whether this is the best vehicle or the worst vehicle, but it is certainly an appropriate vehicle for the Court to step back and evaluate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.389" offset="13351016">And if the Court is concerned about whether it has enough information to allow it to assess what would be the -- the significant impact of revising Price Waterhouse, then it seems to me the right answer would be to ask the parties to -- to brief that in addition to the way they briefed it at this stage.</text>
