            <text syncTime="8.487" offset="141375">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A 1993 congressional apology resolution did not alter Hawaii's right to transfer its public lands or repeal, by implication, prior congressional enactments that had extinguished all competing claims to those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.048" offset="207621">It was, as its sponsor said at the time, a simple apology, and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.269" offset="228519">The lands in question were the former crown and government lands of the Kingdom of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.471" offset="245342">The Republic of Hawaii was the successor in interest in ownership to those lands and was recognized as such by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.743" offset="274390">The 1898 Newlands Resolution of Annexation recited that the Republic of Hawaii was ceding the absolute fee ownership of those lands to the United States, and that that cession was accepted, ratified, and confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.087" offset="331860">Once the United States Congress so acted, all competing claims to title were extinguished, and under precedent going back almost 200 years, the determinations by Congress to accept the cession were final and conclusive on any court.</text>

            <text syncTime="78.250" offset="420467">Your Honor, what the Respondents have contended from day one of this case is that they have a property right in this -- in the land, and the Newlands Resolution conclusively settled that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.558" offset="465711">There is no property interest that could have competed with the United States' perfect title.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.110" offset="483892">That perfect title was passed to the State of Hawaii in 1959 through the 1959 Hawaii Admission Act, which--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="101.616" offset="513881">But would the State of Hawaii, under Hawaii law, be entitled to take the position, if it so chose, that as the new owner of the lands, it has a special duty as a trustee that some other owner might not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark J. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="117.792" offset="578664">--Your Honor, the Admission Act gives the State the right to manage and dispose of the lands according to State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.481" offset="605414">So the political branches certainly have the right to decide which lands they are going to use for which of the five purposes--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="130.718" offset="630387">But then -- then it's just a question of whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court -- assuming that it made the decision that I hypothetically stated -- whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court, as opposed to the Hawaiian Legislature, could make the determination of whether or not there is some special trust obligation imposed on the State of Hawaii by reason of its own duties.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark J. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="152.549" offset="717636">--But, Your Honor, in this case what Respondents urged was that the Apology Resolution changed the legal landscape and commanded the State to hold these lands possibly in perpetuity without alienation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.558" offset="773747">The Hawaii Supreme Court specifically found that the Apology Resolution dictated the result here, that plaintiffs claims did not even arise until the Apology Resolution was signed into law by President Clinton.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.216" offset="824320">In addition, the plaintiffs -- the Respondents urged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court a property right, a property and ownership interest in these lands.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="188.338" offset="860787">But, General Bennett, if I understand correctly, looking to your question presented, the only thing before us is the effect of the Apology Resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.296" offset="908643">The question presented doesn't say anything about the Admissions Act or the Newlands Resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.051" offset="935706">So shouldn't we just stick to the question as you presented it?</text>
            <text syncTime="212.705" offset="958276">Whatever the picture is, does the Apology Resolution have any substantive effect?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark J. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="220.609" offset="989936">--Your Honor, that certainly is one question before the Court, but we believe fairly included in that question is the issue of the nature of the State's sovereign authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.251" offset="1028493">The question presented talks about whether the Apology Resolution changed in any way the State's sovereign authority, and that question -- certainly anterior and predicate to an intelligent resolution of that question is the nature of the State sovereign.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="243.141" stopTime="254.580">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="243.141" offset="1080007">Why is it necessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="243.708" offset="1082305">Why isn't it sufficient just to say that this resolution has no substantive effect, period, and then remand to the Hawaii Supreme Court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark J. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="254.580" offset="1125773">Because, Your Honor, the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision also rests on a premise foreclosed by Federal law, that is that there are competing claims to title.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.020" offset="1159523">As late as page 18 of the red brief, Respondents even say now that Native Hawaiians are entitled to these lands as a matter of property law, but they do not say anywhere in the red brief how that property law claim arises or how that property law claim could survive the Newlands Resolution, the Hawaii Organic Act, or the Admission Act.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="284.849" offset="1246877">General, the difficulty I have is that not only do they not say so, the Supreme Court of Hawaii didn't say so either.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.189" offset="1276238">And it seems to me that we would be well advised to make sure that we understand the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Hawaii before we start talking about the relationship between the various Federal statutes and whatever this claim may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.281" offset="1336633">I simply don't understand the claim myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.400" offset="1345097">I do understand your point, because I think this much is clear from the Hawaiian opinion: That they think the Apology Resolution seriously affects the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.474" offset="1397342">That we can deal with, but once we get out of that, the -- the whole case seems murky to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.862" offset="1418867">Am I missing something?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark J. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="329.545" offset="1425659">Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii Supreme Court, at page 69a of the appendix for the petition, said that this was a claim seeking an injunction -- injunctive relief with regard to property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.920" offset="1471112">At page 87a of the petition appendix, the Hawaii Supreme Court said there are questions regarding the title to the State's ceded lands.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="351.560" stopTime="412.349">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="351.560" offset="1513744">There -- there may well be, but then the Hawaii Supreme Court chose its grounds, and it said at one point the resolution dictates the preservation of the ceded lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.285" offset="1564630">At another place it said that Federal law provides the basis for its decision and that State trust law is interwoven with that Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.259" offset="1612487">It also said that Federal law grounds the decision and provides the governing legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.799" offset="1646655">Now, they could not have been clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.067" offset="1655745">They repeated at least five times that their decision rested on the resolution, that everything turned on that resolution having substantive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.724" offset="1710393">That's why they said their decision was driven by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.945" offset="1727216">And I don't know why we shouldn't take the Hawaii Supreme Court at its word repeated so many times.</text>

          <turn speaker="mark_j_bennett" startTime="412.349" stopTime="434.945">
            <label>Mr. Mark J. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="412.349" offset="1756891">Well, Your Honor, we believe that Respondents' attempt to trivialize this Court's jurisdiction -- they say, for example, in the brief in opposition that even if this Court were to reverse, the Hawaii Supreme Court will simply reinstate the exact same decision, and presumably they would press upon the Court the exact grounds they've pressed for 14 years, that is--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="434.945" stopTime="505.422">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="434.945" offset="1847275">We don't -- we don't know that for sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.445" offset="1857202">It may well be, but there is a large -- large difference, and if they're relying on the Federal ground that insulates them from any check by the Hawaii polity, but if they are forced to rely on State law, then it's up to the people of Hawaii whether they like it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.291" offset="1936614">They could change the State statutory law, equitable notions, constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.714" offset="1970364">But by doing what the Hawaii Supreme Court did, they have taken the case out of the realm of State law, subject to the political check, put it on Federal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.224" offset="2024385">So I think that that's what -- the issue properly before this Court, and not anything about the interpretation of the Admissions Act, which -- if it's implicit in your question, it's a little hard to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.734" offset="2090423">Ordinarily, if a party wants us to address the effect of a piece of legislation, they will mention that in the question presented.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark J. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="505.422" offset="2129189">--Your Honor, I agree that this decision clearly rests on Federal grounds, but we would also suggest that the question presented talks about whether the State's sovereign authority is stripped, and the State's sovereign authority, we would submit, is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.551" offset="2189688">The United States had perfect title.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.167" offset="2200137">The State of Hawaii succeeded to the United States' perfect title.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.538" offset="2217587">Respondents do not suggest anywhere in their pleadings why that is not so, or why they continue to press even with this Court this property right claim to these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.512" offset="2261473">And so we would suggest that it would be prudent for the Court to address what we believe is the fairly included question of the nature of the State's sovereign authority, especially as it would appear to be entirely not subject to contravention by the Respondents--</text>

            <text syncTime="562.561" offset="2357708">And I -- I certainly do think you have a powerful argument that the Apology Resolution presents us with a Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.198" offset="2384248">But the more far-reaching question, as Justice Ginsburg suggests, might not even be very specifically within the question presented, and even if it's fairly embraced, you used the word "prudent".</text>
            <text syncTime="582.256" offset="2436493">It seems prudent for us to confine our decision to the effect of the Apology Resolution and whether or not the Hawaiian Supreme Court got that part of it right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.143" offset="5152078">And so the State -- the State supreme court, by effectively locking up the lands for an indeterminate period of time, has treated them as -- as legally valid and has entered relief that is legal in nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.097" offset="11843814">What the State of Hawaii did with article 12, section 4 of the Hawaii Constitution was essentially to say that, while the State does have some discretion to use the assets in the section 5(f) ceded-lands trust for any of the stated purposes, the State owes a particularly high duty to Native Hawaiians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.291" offset="11912673">The Hawaii Supreme Court has so construed article 12, section 4 in other cases involving the ceded-lands trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.779" offset="11938586">And, at page 39a of its opinion in this case, the Hawaii Supreme Court plainly relied on that provision as a source of its fiduciary duty, the fiduciary duty that we believe was at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.670" offset="11986129">The opinion does not cite that provision in so many words, but it refers to the Hawaii Constitution in a case construing that provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.253" offset="12596454">I would note, however, parenthetically, that immediately after this litigation was commenced the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources imposed a unilateral moratorium on the sale of ceded lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.978" offset="12647340">That moratorium, as an executive matter, has remained in effect during the 14-year pendency of this litigation, even during the considerable period between the trial court's ruling in favor of Petitioners and the Hawaii Supreme Court's ruling in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.988" offset="12703451">So there doesn't seem to be any great impetus on the part of the State to sell ceded lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.872" offset="12722991">Indeed, Governor Lingle, one of the Petitioners in this case, has recently and repeatedly made statements to the effect that the State has no intention to sell ceded lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.104" offset="13835912">And, again, the State executive has been operating under an effective moratorium on the sale of ceded lands of its own volition during the pendency of this litigation, which suggests at a minimum, regardless of the jurisdictional implications, that there is no great burden on the State from this injunction, which, again, by its terms lasts only as long as the State legislature acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.803" offset="13926713">And I would add one additional point on that score, which is that to the extent that we believe that the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision rested on a fiduciary duty under State law, the State would, of course, be free to amend its constitution in order to make clear that the State's fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians does not run to the extent of requiring this injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.550" offset="14013649">But this -- there has been no effort to do that, and I would submit that, as a political matter, it would be highly unlikely.</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.930" offset="14399216">It is undisputed that Respondents asserted a property-interest claim; that any property-interest claim is in flat contradiction with Federal law; that the State has perfect title to these lands; and that there is no possible reason why this Court should not disabuse the State court of the incorrect notion that the State lacks perfect title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.960" offset="14483331">On the mootness issue, the ASARCO versus Kadish case makes clear that the injunction that has been entered is a present injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.883" offset="14514991">But, in addition, the governor, who does not control all of the State lands -- there are a variety of independent agencies that do -- talked about sale but not transfer or exchange, which are other things that are forbidden by this court's -- the State court's -- injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.511" offset="14585522">But ASARCO clearly sets out that we have an injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.213" offset="14600359">But, again, what -- the basis of the State court's decision is a property right interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.367" offset="14624914">It is now undisputed by counsel that such a property right interest is absolutely inconsistent with Federal law, and there is no reason why in this 14-year-old litigation this Court should not make clear the simple and undisputed fact that, pursuant to the Newlands Resolution, the Organic Act, and the Admission Act, that the State has perfect title.</text>
