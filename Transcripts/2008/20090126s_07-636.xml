            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The second of the case as I have this morning is Kennedy and Plan Administrator for DuPont Savings, No. 07-636.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.416" offset="151134">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.480" offset="175376">The decedent, William Kennedy, worked for DuPont and participated in its saving and investment plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.239" offset="218425">The plan allows the participant to designate a beneficiary to receive funds upon -- upon the participantâ€™s death as well as means for changing that designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.048" offset="261580">If no beneficiary is designated, the benefits go to the decedent's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.384" offset="283000">William Kennedy designated his wife Liv as his beneficiary, but by the terms of a subsequent divorce decree, Liv waived her right to the plan benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.878" offset="324901">William did not, however changed his beneficiary designation form.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.464" offset="343291">Upon William's death, the plan paid the benefits to Liv in accordance with William's designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.952" offset="369204">The petitioner, Kari Kennedy, William's daughter and executrix, brought suit against DuPont and the Plan Administrator claiming that Liv's waiver meant that the Estate was entitled of the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.136" offset="418001">The District Court granted summary judgment for the Estate, the Fifth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.570" offset="439735">It held that Liv's waiver was barred by ERISA's anti-alienation provision which requires pension benefit plans to provide that plan benefits may not be assigned or alienated, a provision that the Fifth Circuit believed invalidated Liv's waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.481" offset="511310">The Court of Appeals emphasized that ERISA carves out an exception to the anti-alienation bar for a divorce decree that constitutes a qualified domestic-relations order or QDRO, but that the divorce decree here was not a QDRO and therefore, could not be honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.921" offset="597096">In a unanimous opinion filed today with the clerk of court, we affirm but we do so and reasoning different from the Fifth Circuit's rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.346" offset="630847">Liv's waiver was not barred by ERISA's alienation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.575" offset="647670">It would be unusual to speak of Liv's waiver as an assignment or alienation since she did not control who would receive the benefits in her stead.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.371" offset="686853">And we do not see how the Fifth Circuit's analysis can be squared with certain waivers that are plainly permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.273" offset="710468">For example, the spouse's ability to waive her right to survivor benefits or beneficiary is qualified disclaimer of benefits under the tax code.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.429" offset="747144">Given these concerns, we looked to the common law of trust which informs our interpretation of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.061" offset="773684">The anti-alienation provision is similar to a spendthrift provision and a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.686" offset="792179">And while such a provision bars a beneficiary from assigning benefits, it permits a disclaimer of benefits so long as the disclaimer makes no attempt to designate who is to receive the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.229" offset="838363">The same principle applies here and indeed the Treasury Department interprets its own regulation on the subject to permit a waiver as such Liv's so long as there is no attempt to direct the interests to another person and this interpretation is controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.654" offset="900012">The QDRO provisions have no bearing on this question as they require a transfer would be made to an ultimate payee.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.194" offset="930210">They do not provide a mechanism for a pure waiver and they, therefore, cannot be read to suggest that such a waiver by non-QDRO is barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.635" offset="963960">Nevertheless, we hold that the plan administrator properly disbursed the benefits to Liv.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.269" offset="986530">ERISA requires the administrators to manage ERISA plans in accordance with the documents and instruments governing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.872" offset="1016936">And that is precisely what the plan administrator did.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.643" offset="1031983">The plan documents rule allows employers to establish a uniformed administrative scheme and ensures that administrators do not have to wade through a sea of diverse non-plan documents making difficult determinations about the meaning and enforceability of those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.041" offset="1097603">Requiring a plan administrator to enforce a waiver that did not conform to the plan documents would be counted to ERISA's statutory command and would lead to the very sorts of administrative problems that the plan documents rule is meant to avoid.</text>
