            <text syncTime="6.887" offset="133977">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent's conviction for battering his wife is a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence primarily for two reasons: First, the statutory text is most naturally read that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.817" offset="193745">Second, a contrary reading would defeat Congress's purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.612" offset="208896">Nine courts of appeals have determined that the text does not require a domestic relationship to be an element to the predicate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.155" offset="235018">That's because the statute's text uses only one element, using the singular word "element", which relates to mode of aggression.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.309" offset="267724">It then introduces a new concept related to domestic relationship, using a comma and the word "committed".</text>
            <text syncTime="46.401" offset="292070">The word "committed" naturally modifies the word "offense".</text>
            <text syncTime="50.304" offset="307639">In common usage, a person commits an offense; he doesn't commit a use or attempted use of physical force.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.227" offset="331358">Under Respondent's reading of the statute, when it was enacted it would have become immediately a dead letter in two-thirds of the States, and it wouldn't have any application to the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.656" offset="541069">One used the term "crime of violence" to discuss how violent the statute had to be, and then the second substituted in the new language:</text>

            <text syncTime="136.710" offset="653291">--Both the original structure and the statute as enacted had the same structure in that they had a "committed by" clause that modified the word "offense".</text>
            <text syncTime="145.019" offset="686519">Now, it's true that the use -- (i) and the Romanette (ii), but that all came in because there was a discussion about how violent the offense had to be, both -- in the original statute that was considered, you have an offense committed by a certain person, an offense of a certain type committed by a certain person, and in the statute that was enacted you have an offense of a certain type committed by a certain person.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.819" offset="789755">Now, Congress put more detail in, in terms of what that certain type of offense is.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.427" offset="808145">This has as an "element" language, but it just didn't go to domestic relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.924" offset="826117">And to get back to one of the earlier points in your question, you know, this Court presumes when Congress passes a statute two things are true: First, it knows the legal backdrop on which it enacts the law; and second, that it's presumed that its law is going to have effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.747" offset="881392">And that should be especially true here where Congress was dealing with a serious nationwide problem of domestic violence using firearms.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.662" offset="981076">--I don't think that makes sense for two reasons: First, because when Congress wants to do that, it uses its spending power to give the States incentives to do things like that, and it did that in the VAWA enactment in 1994 and in VAWA re-authorization in 2005.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.308" offset="1039694">And, second, because if you believe what Respondents suggest, you would have to think that a Congress that was very concerned about the powder keg situation of a domestic offender with a gun would want to exempt domestic offenders who have proven that they are willing to hurt family members in two-thirds of the States, a Congress that was presumed -- that was concerned with the problem of domestic violence would enact a statute that would apply so infrequently, to at most these 17 States, and wouldn't apply at all to Federal offenses, making that "misdemeanor under Federal law" language superfluous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.944" offset="4666222">All of the discussion of this in Congress said we need to have a zero tolerance towards people -- zero tolerance policy towards people who are -- have proven that they are willing to commit violent acts against family members; and we already have a statute that prohibits felons from possessing firearms, but we know that sometimes these domestic offenses get charged as misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.673" offset="4741141">And Senator Lautenberg specifically said in the legislative record they are often charged as offenses like assault and battery, and we need to get at these offenses because these people should not have firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.886" offset="4781996">They should not put their families in that type of powder keg situation, and they -- we should not be putting police in that type of situation, where police who respond to a domestic disturbance call like the 911 call in this case are put in a dangerous situation with a person -- an emotionally charged situation -- who would have a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.725" offset="4849392">One other point that I wanted to make with respect to your question, Justice Scalia -- and this is not with respect to how this case should be resolved, but just as a practical matter -- that the VAWA 2005 amendments do require States, for a condition of their grant funding, to have a judicial policy that gives notice for offenses like assault and battery that a person would not be able to possess a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.558" offset="4944687">And the reason that they are doing that is not because, you know, as a constitutional matter we think that they need to, but because they really -- Congress just really wants to keep firearms away from people who have shown that they are willing to hurt family members in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.836" offset="4989827">Now, I talked a little bit in the beginning of argument about how really every -- every indicia of meaning in this case -- and we do look to -- to each of those different interpretive tools before we would invoke the rule of lenity -- points in favor of the Government's construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.894" offset="5046042">First of all, you've got the text, and I think we've -- we've covered those arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.642" offset="5057014">But just as a practical matter, this statute would have an extremely limited effect if it didn't -- if it were interpreted as Respondent suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.465" offset="5088256">The language with respect to Federal misdemeanors would be superfluous because the way that Federal offenses like domestic assaults on Army bases are charged is under a general Federal assault statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.772" offset="5137575">There isn't one that's specific to domestic violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.475" offset="5148338">So Congress would have put this "misdemeanor under Federal law" language in there, and it -- it would have immediately had no effect either.</text>

            <text syncTime="3109.413" offset="12544125">If they said, well, it doesn't -- you know, in context it doesn't fulfill the purposes and therefore we read 1 of the United States Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="3133.995" offset="12642450">So you've got a choice between just using the words unnaturally -- "committed by", taking "committed" and just making it superfluous, as in Respondent's view, or treating the singular "element" as plural, or you can give, as the Government is suggesting, a natural and logical reading that you're talking about an offense of this certain violent character committed by these certain people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.660" offset="12713085">And, yes, that involves looking slightly past Romanette (i) and (ii) structure to look at this being two clauses that both modify the word "offense".</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.336" offset="13559766">With respect, Justice Scalia, you can't just tell from the face of the State indictment whether you would not be able to possess a firearm under Federal law, because the domestic relationship covered by the State offenses, it is a broader universe in each of those 17 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.568" offset="13612743">More domestic relationships are covered than are covered by the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.019" offset="13626535">So you could have been convicted in one of those 17 States of a specific domestic violence offense, and still that would not necessarily be the case that you couldn't possess a firearm under Federal law, because they cover, for example, dating relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.107" offset="13678885">I understand that the notice concerns you've raised but just to get back to one other point that came up with Respondent's counsel, when a person wants to buy a firearm, he fills out this particular form, Form 4473, and that form specifically says on that offenses like assault and battery are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.959" offset="13738235">The ATF regulation that has been in place since this statute was enacted says that those -- that offenses such as assault and battery are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.910" offset="13770104">In fact, all the courts of appeals up until recently, nine of them had this settled understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.844" offset="13789853">Aside from the ATF having it, Congress relied upon it.</text>
