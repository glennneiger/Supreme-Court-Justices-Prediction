            <text syncTime="7.402" offset="135043">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent has agreed with us that the ninth circuit was wrong when it said that the error here and the one in Stromberg were structural defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.160" offset="194079">The remaining question is whether Respondent can salvage the Stromberg rule by making it part of a proper harmless error test as he attempted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.703" offset="240264">His harmless error test is wrong for several reasons, but the Stromberg part of it was wrong for basically one reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.041" offset="281537">He makes the Stromberg rule into a rule of harmless error, and it is not even a correct rule of error.</text>

            <text syncTime="66.361" offset="370876">So when Respondent says, invoking Stromberg, that to instruct the jury on valid and invalid theories is harmless error if the jury adopted a valid theory, what Respondent is saying is nothing more than that no error occurred in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.586" offset="455722">Because the jury found everything it needed to find in order to convict and, therefore, did not misapply the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.457" offset="4439291">The Ninth Circuit's contrary interpretation of Stromberg creates the untenable result that adding an invalid theory -- adding a valid theory to an invalid one somehow makes the error worse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1172.687" offset="4796123">Yes, Your Honor, but I would add that this Court should also clarify the scope of that harmless error inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.545" offset="4823604">I think there are two important principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.573" offset="4831754">There is no logical reason to apply a narrower form of harmless error review in this case than the Court did in Neder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.838" offset="4860803">So I think that this Court should clarify that the principles of harmlessness articulated in Neder should apply on remand to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.021" offset="4889537">I think those of those principles bear mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.739" offset="4900404">First, the question is not what the jury actually or necessarily found, but rather, it encompasses what a rationale jury would have found absent the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.658" offset="4944081">And I think the second important point for this Court to clarify is that harmlessness review is not limited to cases, is not limited to cases where the relevant elements are undisputed, but rather even when disputed, a reviewing court should consider the entire record and determine whether, in light of the jury finding, there is sufficient evidence to support a contrary verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.586" offset="5035719">And then it should remand, Your Honor, to the court of appeals to apply those principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.919" offset="5125057">The jury returned a special circumstance verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.903" offset="5137074">And we know based upon that verdict that at a minimum, the jury found that Respondent was a major participant in the crime -- just taking the facts of this case, the Respondent was a major participant in the robbery, that he exhibited a reckless disregard for human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.225" offset="5194334">And we also know that the jury rejected a duress defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1333.374" offset="5438945">One possibility is that the jury relies upon the defective instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.464" offset="5455245">For example, there is one element omitted just like the instruction in Neder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.683" offset="5472172">If that's what the jury had done, then this case is no different than Neder, no better, no worse, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.412" offset="5495056">The other possibility, however, is that the jury relies on the completely valid theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.363" offset="5514909">If the jury relied on the completely valid theory, then there is even less of a problem than Neder.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.410" offset="7487049">The district attorney developed the theme quite effectively that, even under Mr. Pulido's own account, he exhibited reckless indifference because he saw the mortally wounded victim lying there, and the D.A. said, did you try to resuscitate him?</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.604" offset="7563849">Have you ever had a CPR class?</text>

            <text syncTime="1961.768" offset="7952447">Your Honor, I think I could best answer that by offering my own critique of the Ninth Circuit opinion and -- which may explain why it may be unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.030" offset="7997586">In my opinion, what the analysis that the Ninth Circuit conducted was equivalent to a sufficient analysis, equivalent to the point of equipoise discussed in O'Neal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.164" offset="8058086">That is to say, it reviewed the evidence and said -- and the verdicts and the instructions -- and said we're uncertain, we can't tell which way the jury went.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.533" offset="8099568">My critique of the Ninth Circuit's -- at least its per curiam opinion, as opposed to one of the concurring opinions, is that in fact this is not just a general verdict case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.498" offset="8151395">We know a great deal about the jurors' thinking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.276" offset="8170517">We know that by a vote of either 8-4 or 4-8, the jurors rejected the prosecution's primary theory, which was that Pulido personally shot the victim and that, in the prosecutor's words, Aragon had nothing to do with this, Aragon wasn't there, Aragon isn't a murderer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.549" offset="8251601">We also know -- and this will be another echo of the Sarausad case -- we also know that throughout their five days of deliberations, the jurors submitted question after question directed to what are now -- what are concededly defective erroneous instructions, and moreover, those questions focused right in on the defect in the instructions and in particular the timing of Mr. Pulido's assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.021" offset="8381482">And I refer the Court in particular to the jurors' handwritten diagrams of alternative conceptions of felony-murder aiding and abetting liability, which are at 36 to 38 of the joint appendix, and also the jurors' question at page 41 of the joint appendix whether -- this goes right -- this goes, as the district court said, to the crux of the issue: Does the defendant have to have knowledge before or during the crime of the -- of the unlawful purpose of the perpetrator?</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.103" offset="8505825">And as to both of those questions the judge said: Go back and reread those same instructions, which of course were erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.379" offset="8538948">So my critique of the Ninth Circuit opinion, which is again slightly different, I think, than the State's, would be that it neglected to mention that compelling evidence that in fact the jurors actually found a set of facts corresponding to the invalid late joiner theory, because in my view what -- the analysis the Ninth Circuit conducted gets us to a point of equipoise, and that's enough for Brecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.728" offset="8660365">The defect in the Ninth Circuit's analysis is they neglected to also factor in those juror queries, and in my view the juror queries move us from a state of equipoise to a very high probability that the jurors relied on the -- and adopted a factual scenario corresponding to an invalid theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.437" offset="8899124">We also know that -- drawing upon the relationship between the Brecht standard and others, we know that a Strickland standard is deemed to -- that if you have Strickland prejudice, you don't have to go through a separate Brecht analysis.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Bradley O'Connell</label>
            <text syncTime="2323.776" offset="9400571">Your Honor -- and, again, I don't -- I don't strenuously object to that because, as I've mentioned if the court, if the court remains, remains of the view that what the Ninth Circuit did was simply incompatible with Brecht, then I agree it should be sent back and I -- and I understand why that might be the Court's inclination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.048" offset="9481655">Let me offer another angle for why what the Ninth Circuit did is entirely compatible with Brecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.793" offset="9512584">In civil cases, this Court routinely applies the same sort of general verdict analysis which in criminal cases has become to be known as the Stromberg line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.883" offset="9568904">In fact, it did it as recently this summer in the Exxon Valdez case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.554" offset="9587608">Now civil cases don't have Chapman, they don't have structural defect; civil cases are subject to a harmless error standard which ultimately goes back to the identical statute which was construed in Kotteakos.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.329" offset="9646749">And going back to the opinion of the Court in O'Neal, in addressing the relationship between Kotteakos/Brecht harmless error review and civil harmless error review, the Court indicated he think rather strongly that those standards are either equivalent or to the extent that they differ, the Brecht/Kotteakos standard is less forgiving of error because of the liberty interest at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.299" offset="9790631">Now that means two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.940" offset="9797214">From a retrospective point of view of simply construing this Court's different lines of cases, I think it demonstrates that this general verdict analysis is entirely consistent with a Kotteakos type harmless error analysis, but it also has some perspective implications, because if this Court were to wholly disavow that type of analysis and say that has nothing to do with harmless error review, that's going to impact civil cases, too; and obviously in all this Court's opinions, the Court is considering not only the immediate case, but what is going to happen if we -- if we rule one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.452" offset="9967219">So this case -- this case supports a finding of prejudice under that O'Neal equipoise and as for the Ninth Circuit did, that's not what it called it, it even more strongly supports prejudice when one factors in the rest of the record, notably the juror -- the juror queries and another item which I think may be responsive to some of Justice Alito's earlier questions, which is the strength of the evidence on the various theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.611" offset="10107862">There were three theories and obviously there was evidence in support of the prosecution's main theory that Pulido shot the victim himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.762" offset="10152479">There was evidence -- obviously there was substantial evidence in the form of Pulido's own testimony in support of the invalid late-joiner theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.791" offset="10188633">Out of these the one theory that had least support in the record before the jury was the valid aiding and abetting theory, because no witness testified to a scenario in which Pulido assisted in some fashion or another prior to the shooting; nor did the prosecutor attempt to develop that type of scenario in argument because the prosecutor was very clear: Prosecutor said you're going to get aiding and abetting instructions just in case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.947" offset="10333247">They only apply -- if -- they only come into play if you were to believe the defendant's story which was a real whopper; but if you believe the defendant's story the felony murder rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.552" offset="10371594">But then the prosecutor immediately went back,</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.005" offset="10381416">"but I don't think it applies at all, Aragon wasn't there. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.784" offset="10396568">"Aragon didn't do it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.004" offset="10401479">"Pulido did it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.691" offset="10404195">and prosecutor went back to his primary theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.609" offset="10411823">So the theory which the -- present in the instructions was least before the jury, was the valid aiding and abetting theory, yet defining this conceded error harmless depends on the notion either that the jury actually adopted a pre-shooting aiding or abetting or that they necessarily would have adopted one if properly instructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.535" offset="10547555">There is one final point I'd like to make, which is there is a qualitative aspect to Brecht; and when one has an error under which the defense testimony even if believed renders the defendant guilty erroneously, that derails the entire defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.649" offset="10643999">That it seems to me is the quintessential substantial and injurious influence; because it practically renders the trial nullity by erroneously telling the jury even if you find this set of facts, the defendant is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.112" offset="10709828">So for these reasons and additionally for the very thorough prejudice analysis found in the district court opinion, we urge the Court to affirm, despite the Ninth Circuit's inapt nomenclature, but in the event the Court is dissatisfied with that explanation, we have acknowledged that the appropriate course in that instance would be to send it back under Brecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.177" offset="10814109">Unless the Court has any further questions, I'm prepared to submit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.541" offset="10931555">In Calderon v Coleman, this Court said there is a difference between the error test and the harmless error test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.331" offset="10962693">All these questions that the jury asked went to the question of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.048" offset="10985576">Did the jury misapply the law by failing to find a contemporaneity aspect of felony murder?</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.250" offset="11014416">They did not go to the harmless error question of what the jury would have done had it been properly instructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.779" offset="11040538">We urge the Court in remanding the case to make clear that the error analysis must be kept separate from the harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.539" offset="11079617">This is a mistake Judge Thomas made in his concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.320" offset="11094664">We -- he assumes -- he sees a mistake in an instruction; he assumes that the mistake rises to the level of constitutional error; and then he does a prejudice analysis by deciding whether the mistake caused the jury to misapply the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.796" offset="11160597">In other words, he -- he applies an error analysis to decide prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.951" offset="11185256">And what he does is he includes all this evidence of the questions the jury asked when those questions went only to the misapplication of law that was the error, and did nothing to show the basis of the jury's special circumstance finding, which is the heart of the harmless error determination here.</text>
