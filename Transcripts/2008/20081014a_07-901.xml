            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We will hear argument next in Case 07-901, Oregon v. Ice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.118" offset="125848">Ms. Williams.</text>

          <turn speaker="mary_h_williams" startTime="6.570" stopTime="83.320">
            <label>Ms. Mary H. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="6.570" offset="131699">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The factfinding at issue in this case is significantly different than the factfinding at issue in this Court's recent Sixth Amendment cases, in which the Court struck down changes in sentencing practice that had the effect of removing factfinding from the province of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.781" offset="208499">In those cases, the change in practice meant that a defendant could be convicted by the jury for one offense and then, based on nonjury factfinding, the defendant could be sentenced for what appeared to be an aggravated, more serious offense without the jury having made all the factual determinations necessary for that more serious offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.564" offset="299719">That doesn't happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.516" offset="311526">In this case, the jury convicted Mr. Ice of six counts, and the sentence imposed on each of those six convictions satisfies the Apprendi rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.872" offset="348933">There's no additional jury factfinding that alters or nonjury factfinding, excuse me, that alters a specific sentence for one of the convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.977" offset="385296">Instead, what the factfinding in this case does is to significantly restrain the judge's ability to decide how to administer those multiple sentences for the multiple convictions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="83.320" stopTime="137.205">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="83.320" offset="438690">Well, but it, it, by reason of the unusual law at issue here I think it's unusual, I don't I'm unaware of any other State that has one the sentences the defendant has an entitlement to have the sentences run concurrently unless a certain additional fact exists and that additional fact is to be found by the judge rather than by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.839" offset="560734">So that if you take seriously what what we have said in prior cases, namely that any fact which has the effect of lengthening the sentence to which the defendant is entitled must be found by the jury if you take that seriously, I don't see why it doesn't apply here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mary_h_williams" startTime="137.205" stopTime="156.535">
            <label>Ms. Mary H. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="137.205" offset="654252">Justice Scalia, first on the point in terms of how unique this statute is, there are other States that have similar requirements, that there is initial a presumption that multiple sentences will be concurrent unless there is additional nonjury factfinding that authorizes the judge to impose consecutive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.000" offset="725410">So it's not entirely--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="156.535" stopTime="158.118">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="156.535" offset="731575">How many others?</text>
            <text syncTime="157.118" offset="733874">Do you know?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mary_h_williams" startTime="158.118" stopTime="221.561">
            <label>Ms. Mary H. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="158.118" offset="737844">--It's difficult actually to come up with an exact count, and the numbers vary when you look at how other courts have sort of combined cases, but perhaps as many as 13, but as different States have sort of changed their practice some of those have fallen away.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.812" offset="800643">It's clear that there's at least a minority of States that have this kind of limitation on what is otherwise inherent or a discretionary authority of the judge to decide how to administer these multiple sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.721" offset="852261">The difference is that what this Court has been addressing in the Apprendi line of cases has always been a specific sentence imposed on a specific conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.779" offset="900535">And what Oregon Supreme Court did was to expand that to say that, in addition to the statutory maximum that this Court described in Blakely, there is in effect a second statutory maximum that you must consider when there are multiple sentences being imposed for multiple convictions, and that's the total period of incarceration that the defendant will serve with and without the additional factfinding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="221.561" stopTime="240.689">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="221.561" offset="991650">You know, this fact can can turn out to be the most significant fact for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.333" offset="1026759">I mean, it could lengthen his sentence enormously.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.785" offset="1044522">It's more important than many of the other facts that we leave to the jury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mary_h_williams" startTime="240.689" stopTime="281.683">
            <label>Ms. Mary H. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="240.689" offset="1068136">Yes, Your Honor, and in this case, for example, the additional factfinding extends the whole duration of the of Mr. Ice's period of incarceration from 90 months to 340 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.699" offset="1124248">But what is significant is that, as this Court said in Blakely, the Sixth Amendment is a reservation of jury power; it's not a limitation on judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.155" offset="1166043">And I would submit it's not a limitation on legislative power, except to the extent that that exercise of power removed something from the province of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.410" offset="1203033">Historically, it's undisputed that the judge made this decision about how multiple sentences would be administered.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="281.683" stopTime="307.583">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="281.683" offset="1232185">But you could say the same about sentencing in general, and we held that the Sixth Amendment does impose a limitation upon judicial power where at least there is an entitlement by law to a certain lower sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.311" offset="1298641">And there we said you can't leave it to the judge to decide whether the facts that trigger that law exist or not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mary_h_williams" startTime="307.583" stopTime="363.837">
            <label>Ms. Mary H. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="307.583" offset="1335735">I think what's important is the foundation for that holding and the foundation for the Apprendi rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.487" offset="1363320">It wasn't simply that factfinding in general that exposes the defendant to a harsher punishment is something that should would be better served by having it done by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.545" offset="1407624">It was that, because of the changes in sentencing practices, because States and Congress have been taking what traditionally had been elements of an offense and relabeling them as something else, as sentencing factors, that the jury was no longer finding what traditionally it would have found for each conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.876" offset="1488917">It was no longer finding what would have been each element of an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.743" offset="1504381">So what the rule does is it provides a bright-line way of testing what is the functional equivalent of an element for a specific offense that would have been within the province of the jury and therefore that can't be removed without violating the Sixth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.320" offset="1562687">The rule does bear on culpability, and culpability sounds like part of the definition of an offense or a more serious offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.811" offset="1616708">And I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed this case as in terms of -- that it may have simply been happenstance that the Court was looking only at single convictions and single sentences being imposed on those.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.951" offset="1665191">But I think that takes away the analysis that the court used in reaching the conclusions that it reached.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="404.711" offset="1724228">You said it's only happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.978" offset="1729348">He has to do it under the statute if he makes the finding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mary_h_williams" startTime="408.413" stopTime="456.577">
            <label>Ms. Mary H. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="408.413" offset="1739065">--No, what I'm trying to say is that I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed the fact that so far in this Court's cases you had only been dealing with a single offense and a single sentence, as -- as not foreclosing the possibility that there would be a different statutory maximum when you have multiple sentences being imposed for multiple convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.177" offset="1826105">And so the supreme court, I think, treated it -- what I was saying was it simply is happenstance that that had been the -- the nature of the cases that this Court has decided, but then drew from this Court's decision and from discussion about punishment a broader meaning that somehow the jury must be involved in any factual determination that relates to the overall quantum of punishment for multiple sentences being imposed.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="456.577" stopTime="515.616">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="456.577" offset="1931745">Well, didn't we furnish the premise for that broader reasoning?</text>
            <text syncTime="460.129" offset="1945955">Because we pointed out that the traditional role of the jury was standing in effect as the buffer between the power of the State and the individual, and our concern in the Apprendi cases was that the concept of elements was being manipulated in such a way that the jury no longer stood in that -- in effect, that buffer position.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.779" offset="2056505">And I guess the question here would be, is there -- is there room for -- in effect, for manipulation by the law in the consecutive sentencing scheme or the potential consecutive sentencing scheme, so that the jury in effect loses control over the length, the ultimate length of time that an individual is going to serve?</text>
            <text syncTime="513.830" offset="2160786">What is your response to that?</text>

            <text syncTime="515.616" offset="2167892">That the jury does not lose anything that the jury historically had within its--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="521.000" offset="2189416">No, but isn't the problem with that argument the problem that Justice Scalia raised a moment ago, where you could have made the same argument with respect to a mandatory State guideline, but nonetheless, the change in the law brought to bear on the new law an old concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.545" offset="2271650">And this is a change in the law, to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.866" offset="2284920">I agree with you, historically.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.568" offset="2295683">The judges -- once consecutive sentencing came in at all, they were free to, in effect, do what they wanted to, subject to some kind of a rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.072" offset="2329746">But we've got to apply the Apprendi concept and the concern of the jury trial right to this new situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.010" offset="2365482">So I don't think it's an answer to say, well, the judge has never had such a -- such a power.</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary H. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="571.766" offset="2392440">--But there's something different here in terms of looking back on history and what we have presently, compared to when you are looking at the offense-specific sentence associated with a specific conviction, because the changes in practice there had the effect of taking away the ability to find an element or something that was the equivalent of an element, of removing that from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.763" offset="2480421">And, historically, that is clearly what the jury's job was: To stand in as a buffer between the defendant and the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.952" offset="2509260">So I gather from your argument that you would -- you would be taking the other side and you would be saying that it has to go to the jury if, instead of being a statute that applies to concurrent sentences from various crimes, there was added to a particular crime, if this crime was committed with the use of a gun, any sentence imposed shall not run concurrently but shall run consecutively with any other sentence arising out of this same occurrence?</text>

            <text syncTime="654.468" offset="2723255">--No, Your Honor, I don't, although I think that makes it a more difficult situation to try to analyze, because there it is -- it is focused on a specific sentence for a specific offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.144" offset="2778008">But what is different is it still goes to not adding to the penalty for that sentence, but adding to how you are going to administer multiple sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.916" offset="2817087">And the history here is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.701" offset="2824192">Because what we have is, even though there wasn't a statute when the Framers would have looked at this issue, the issue did exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.557" offset="2859614">Judges did make the determination about how multiple sentences would be administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.978" offset="2881348">And what they would have considered would have been a wide array of facts and without really limitation other than--</text>

            <text syncTime="702.567" offset="2915725">You could say the same thing about the length of the sentence, that it was up to them and they considered a wide array of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.887" offset="2948953">So what?</text>
            <text syncTime="711.756" offset="2952401">We said in Apprendi, once you try to narrow it by law and say they can't do more than this, once you do that, that fact has to be found by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.029" offset="2997541">And that's what's going on here.</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary H. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="724.780" offset="3004541">--But I think what's different is that the history at issue and underlying Apprendi actually wasn't that the judge could simply make nonjury factfinding and expand the sentence beyond what the sentence was that was associated with the jury's verdict; that, in fact, that was the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1384.133" offset="5641968">And so it was in the nature really of a mitigation that the judge could do to lessen the severity of the punishment based on certain facts that the judge would consider and then in simply exercising the judge's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.957" offset="5693273">But what is important here, I think, is that it was clearly something for the judge to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.594" offset="5711768">Once there were the multiple convictions, the jury's role was at an end, and it was then up to the judge to make the determination about how to administer those multiple sentences.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.382" offset="6266922">Oregon law entitles a criminal defendant to a concurrent sentence for each offense unless certain facts are found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.869" offset="6292940">Here for three offenses a judge found those facts and imposed a greater penalty of a consecutive sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.206" offset="6318226">That violated defendant's -- or the Sixth Amendment's jurytrial guarantee that the judge's authority to impose criminal punishment must be limited by the facts solely found by the jury.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="1563.228" offset="6358350">Mr. Lannet, there -- there is one significant difference, I think, between -- the -- in Apprendi it doesn't matter whether the State labels something a "sentencing factor" or an "element".</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.757" offset="6420417">Every one of those questions that goes into determining the maximum length of a sentence has to go to a jury under Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.327" offset="6454690">But when it comes to consecutive versus concurrent, it's perfectly okay if a State says, our main rule is consecutive, but the judge, if there are certain mitigating factors, can make it concurrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.074" offset="6533684">Or it leaves the total things to the discretion of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.728" offset="6552283">And if we are looking at it from the point of view of a defendant, the State says, well, we are not going to make it totally discretionary because we want to be more defendant-friendly; that is, we are putting certain restraints on the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.571" offset="6611738">So it seems -- what seems odd to me about this case is the Sixth Amendment is supposed to protect the defendant's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.308" offset="6638696">And here the State is saying, we want to give the defendant more of a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.545" offset="6663565">And he can say, that's unconstitutional, but if you give me less of a right, it would be perfectly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.000" offset="6697420">It's that enigma that I think is very disturbing about this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ernest G. Lannet</label>
            <text syncTime="1652.702" offset="6716228">Well, two points on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.738" offset="6724378">One of them is that historically the jury trial -- the jury found the verdict of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.708" offset="6748202">That, in itself, authorized the potential penalty of a very significant consecutive sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.529" offset="6767532">Oregon has made a different policy choice here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.029" offset="6777563">And, to understand the full backdrop of it, perhaps the context, that before this Oregon -- before it had this statutory system in place, it had very liberal rules regarding merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.753" offset="6820404">This was part of a series of enactments in which antimerger provisions were enacted so the defendant's criminal history would represent more accurately the number of convictions the jury had found him guilty of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.727" offset="6864290">Therefore, the defendants under -- in Oregon law the defendant must receive a separate sentence for each offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.048" offset="6885606">So the increased number of sentences gave rise to the possibility of longer sentences through consecutive sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.468" offset="6919252">Because in Oregon not only does an offense give rise to a discrete sentence, but whether the -- the sentence is concurrent or consecutive is an aspect of punishment for that offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.537" offset="12571523">The Apprendi rule has been applied as a bright-line test for deciding when a sentence for a specific condition has satisfied the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.743" offset="12616349">And the way it operates is the rule itself tells us what are the necessary facts that the jury must find, and so there doesn't need to be a new rule to determine what are those constitutionally protected facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.586" offset="12671728">The Apprendi rule does that for us by saying that any fact that exposes a defendant in a particular conviction and sentence to a greater penalty based on -- that -- based on a fact that the jury has not found, is the functional equivalent of an element if we had looked historically at what the jury's role was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.416" offset="12755111">And so, therefore, that additional factfinding, if it exposes the defendant to a -- a longer penalty, a greater penalty for a specific conviction, it must be found by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.791" offset="12796594">And that is how the Court has applied the rule to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.159" offset="12810073">So all we are asking is that the Court clarify that that is the full scope of the Apprendi rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.813" offset="12836718">And the reason for that is again, going back to what this Court said in Blakely, that the Sixth Amendment is only a reservation of jury power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.168" offset="12870050">And here what we have here is something that is entirely a judicial determination -- that historically has always been a judicial determination -- and the only overlay we now have is a legislative effort to regulate that judicial authority through the mechanism of requiring factfinding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.499" offset="12951448">It's something that the legislature often does, is to try to regulate judicial discretion by requiring factfinding and by limiting the kinds of facts the judge may consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.538" offset="12991572">And that's what is being done in this case without removing anything from the purview of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.643" offset="13023963">And so we would ask that this Court reverse the Oregon Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.745" offset="13044443">Thank you.</text>
