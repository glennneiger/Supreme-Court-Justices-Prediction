            <text syncTime="6.263" offset="130445">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents' state law claims track nearly verbatim the Cigarette Labeling Act's pre-emption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.303" offset="174644">For example, the complaint challenges promotions of light cigarettes as less harmful and safer to smokers than regular cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.279" offset="222501">But the statute, Congress, explicitly preempted any requirement respecting the promotion of cigarettes based upon smoking and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.384" offset="266909">In short, the Respondents are seeking in state court precisely what Congress pre-empted.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="49.505" offset="303480">Mr. Olson, what if the state law claim did not require any inquiry into the relationship between smoking and health?</text>
            <text syncTime="57.456" offset="335245">Something along the lines of saying our studies show that light cigarettes are healthier for you, and in fact their studies show the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.421" offset="371085">So all you, all the plaintiff would have to show is that there was a deception, a disconnect between the studies and the ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.012" offset="397416">It wouldn't matter whether light cigarettes were healthier or not healthier.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.059" offset="413612">Is that the type of action that could be brought?</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="79.228" offset="422285">--Well, I think the facts could differ from case to case, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.072" offset="437750">But the inquiry is going to be generally, I think, simple: Is there a requirement?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.537" offset="463559">Is it based upon smoking and health, and does it appear in an advertising or promotion of a cigarette.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.691" offset="488218">Now, I suppose there might be conceivably circumstances where it's impossible to tell that the requirement is not connected in some way with smoking and health, but it's certainly clear here.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.844" offset="532835">The complaint specifically talks in terms of promoting cigarettes, purporting to be less harmful or safer, despite serious health problems associated with smoking.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.888" offset="576930">These appear at the beginning in paragraph 2 of the amended complaint which is at pages, beginning Joint Appendix pages 26 through 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.632" offset="623950">I invite the Court's attention to paragraph 2 of the amended complaint and paragraphs 15 and 18 of the amended complaint.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="153.026" offset="717573">Is it a question of just how you phrase it, Mr. Olson?</text>
            <text syncTime="156.731" offset="732306">Is there any scope -- does your argument leave any scope for attorney general, state attorney general imposition of state law remedies against a deceptive practice involving advertising cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.691" offset="804195">To give you concrete examples, suppose a state attorney general said in every -- suppose the practice were in every carton of cigarettes the cigarette manufacturer includes an insert that says: If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes; if you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.537" offset="915581">And the state attorney general goes after that statement in the carton as false and deceptive advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.676" offset="956123">Would there be any scope for that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="214.361" offset="962915">I think that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.316" offset="966677">In answer to the general question that you ask, Justice Gins burg, there is plenty of room for an attorney general to pursue deceptive advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.219" offset="1002308">Another example -- and I'll come to the one you mentioned -- is that someone might misrepresent the number of cigarettes in a package or other things having to do with cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.106" offset="1037834">That would not necessarily be related to smoking and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.101" offset="1049851">So there is not a pre-emption if there is not a relationship between the prohibition and smoking and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.335" offset="1078794">The example you gave might require some sort of inquiry as to what is motivating the attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.551" offset="1103663">The motivation is what you referred to, your Court referred to in the Reilly case and I would say--</text>

            <text syncTime="256.312" offset="1130621">Mr. Olson, doesn't your answer in effect, in practical terms, exclude the possibility of inserts like that?</text>
            <text syncTime="265.826" offset="1168760">I mean, what else would they be addressing except smoking and health?</text>
            <text syncTime="269.387" offset="1182971">That's the only subject on the table.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.010" offset="1189449">--I think that's probably true in most cases, Justice Souter, that the reason why there might be regulations at the State level having to do with cigarettes and advertising by and large is going to have to do with smoking and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.007" offset="1241485">The Court went through the same inquiry in the Reilly case where it had to do with billboards and--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="290.270" offset="1266458">So your answer then to my specific example would be the attorney general could not go after such a statement,</text>

            <text syncTime="300.234" offset="1306373">--If -- if the courts were to conclude that it had a relationship with smoking and health, the answer is yes, Justice Ginsburg, but there might be some case in which someone said, well, the issue about nicotine and content of nicotine is being regulated because it doesn't have anything to do with smoking and health, but in the environment in which this -- this statute was passed and this litigation was pursued, there certainly isn't any question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.051" offset="1421625">Now, I think Justice Stevens, even in his dissenting opinion in the Reilly case, focused on the content.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.187" offset="1450151">He said and the -- your dissenting opinion in that case said, as opposed to location, that the Labeling Act was focusing on the content of advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.094" offset="2197776">However, the very case that the Cipollone decision in the plurality did decide was pre-empted even under that plurality opinion, and this is at page 527 of the opinion, is an advertising that purported to neutralize, minimize, down-play, negate, or disclaim the warning label on the packages.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.146" offset="2774037">And then Congress went on to point out that with the labeling requirements, it intended for consumers to receive certain information about the smoking of cigarettes with specific labels, and then went on to say, without hurting the commerce and the national economy to be protected from confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations that might be</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.473" offset="13711297">I -- we feel that we explained it very thoroughly in our briefs, and I thought knowing that the time was limited I thought we should focus on the strongest argument I think by any stretch of the imagination, when Congress has spoken directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.168" offset="13766050">Now, first of all, with respect to what the Solicitor General on behalf of the United States says, and this is in response to the point that Justice Scalia was just addressing -- page 1 of the Reilly brief, the Attorney General is responsible for enforcing the Labeling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.987" offset="13841387">So it is the government's responsibility, according to them, to enforce the Labeling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.129" offset="13865942">Then on pages 8 and 9 of their brief, distinguishing between the location of the billboards in that case and other things that would be pre-empted, pages 8 and 9, the Government said the Labeling Act preempts State laws concerning the content of cigarette advertising with respect to smoking and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.384" offset="13950997">And the Acting Solicitor General on page 25 of the transcript of the argument that day in this case was asked that question, what is pre-empted?</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.941" offset="13993211">And she said it pre-empts State law claims about filters or the safety of a particular cigarette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.313" offset="14026648">That is this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.924" offset="14033126">Isn't the point, it doesn't pre-empt rules about location; it pre-empts rules about content?</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.998" offset="14061443">That was the government's point.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="3490.905" offset="14069070">That's the government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.122" offset="14073877">Now, if that's their position, isn't it just one additional step to say depending on what the history of the statute is, that it pre-empts regulations about content that don't have to do with lying about the content?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="3509.364" stopTime="3659.598">
            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="3509.364" offset="14142840">It has to do according to what Congress said about the content of the advertising and the promotion of cigarettes; that's what this case is about when it has to do with smoking and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.235" offset="14190383">Now, my opponent seems to run away, in answer to your question, about what if we take out smoking and health from their complaint?</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.859" offset="14220894">Well, they can't take out smoking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.435" offset="14227163">That is everywhere in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.603" offset="14235836">I asked the Court to sit down and compare the labeling statute with the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.460" offset="14259242">And the words are indistinguishable, and they say over and over again and on page 4A of -- then Mr. Frederick's saying well, all they want is economic damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.393" offset="14315039">They are really not -- they are just concerned about they got one cigarette and they wanted to get another cigarette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.780" offset="14332489">Page 4A, this is the way the Court of Appeals understood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.360" offset="14346909">This is page 4A of the petition appendix: the plaintiffs explain that the relative levels of these substances bear on a reasonable consumer's decision on which cigarette to purchase, because consumers understand that reducing the quantities of tar and nicotine in cigarettes reduces their adverse health effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.899" offset="14429038">That is what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.410" offset="14439069">Now, I will just conclude in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.036" offset="14453593">The statute in the language of this Court in the Reilly case, uses "sweeping language".</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.501" offset="14479402">The language is every bit as sweeping as the language in the airline deregulation act that uses the phrase relates to, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.170" offset="14506151">So there is three requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.436" offset="14515137">Either -- the statute prohibits, any and it uses the phrase "any", you can't get more expansive than that; and it uses the word "no" requirements or prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.227" offset="14562367">The Court has dealt with requirements and prohibition in Reilly, Cipollone, Bates, Wolens, Riegel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.489" offset="14591415">The statute that we are talking about here in this case is the same statute essentially that it was dealing with in Reilly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.393" offset="14622971">It's the State Unfair Practices Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.988" offset="14629345">It was Massachusetts/Maine; but I compared the statutes side by side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.954" offset="14645227">They essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.872" offset="14652959">Is the requirement based upon smoking and health?</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.545" offset="14667588">Well, the complaint specifically says so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.589" offset="14675738">The relief is based upon the relationship between smoking and health and is it in promotion or advertising of tobacco?</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.307" offset="14702696">Again, they've said that over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.776" offset="14712519">I submit that the statute could not be more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.898" offset="14729028">This particular complaint seeks to impose a regulation--</text>

            <text syncTime="3664.614" offset="14763928">I believe it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.033" offset="14769570">However, Justice Stevens, I believe when you talked about in that -- the plurality opinion, you talked about minimizing, reducing, negating the effect of the warning labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.406" offset="14818994">That's also this complaint.</text>
