            <text syncTime="10.772" offset="148522">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals in this case untethered CERCLA liability for response costs from the plain statutory language of CERCLA section 107(a)( 3), and in so doing also imposed potentially crippling liability on entities with only the most attenuated connection to any harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.553" offset="243608">107(a)( 3), which was reprinted in the petition appendix in 1607 on page 266a, provides that among the potentially responsible parties under CERCLA are so-called arrangers; that is, those persons who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal of hazardous substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.801" offset="336603">The paradigmatic case, of course, would be a generator of hazardous waste calls up Co.&gt; ["] and asks Waste Co. to take those substances to a landfill or to otherwise dispose of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.692" offset="384146">Where CERCLA does not define a statutory term -- and there's no definition of "arrange" -- this Court has long said, for example in United States against Bestfoods, that we look to the ordinary meaning of the language, and the plain meaning, the ordinary meaning, of "arrange for" is to make plans or preparations to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.272" offset="466484">The ordinary meaning of the word "for" is to refer to a purpose or goal.</text>
