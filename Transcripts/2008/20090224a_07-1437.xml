            <label>Mr. Glenn W. Rhodes</label>
            <text syncTime="11.243" offset="150403">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The single issue presented in this case is whether the bar to review under 1447(d) is applicable to a district court's discretionary decision to decline the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.887" offset="240995">In this case, after the district court dismissed Respondents' Federal RICO claim, the district court remanded the remaining State law claims under 1367(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="51.516" offset="311526">That was not a remand based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because jurisdiction was specifically conferred upon the court by 1367(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="63.656" offset="360009">It's been the rule for some 30 years that the bar of 1447(d) is limited to the specific grounds set forth in 1447(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="76.964" offset="413299">And for reference the statutes are on page 2 and 3 of Petitioner's blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.285" offset="438585">Those two grounds are a remand that's based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a remand that is based upon any defect other than a lack of subject matter jurisdiction if it's raised by a timely motion for remand filed within 30 days of the notice of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.102" offset="537851">The only prong of 1447(c) that's applicable in this case is whether this remand is one that's based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.160" offset="594066">Now, Congress clearly conferred jurisdiction on the district courts in 1367(a), where the case contains a Federal claim and related State law claims, and a remand based upon a court's discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is not a remand that's based upon the court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.977" offset="705348">Jurisdiction either exists or it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.131" offset="729903">A district court's power to hear a case and its power to decline the exercise of jurisdiction are part and parcel of the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.307" offset="786641">Absent the power to hear a case, a district court cannot decline to exercise that -- or cannot exercise discretion to decline to exercise that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.996" offset="833452">Now, in the -- this Court's Osborn v. Haley case, it made reference back to Carnegie-Mellon and also United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, that even if only State law claims are remaining in the case after the Federal claim has been resolved, the district court has discretion consistent with Article III to retain jurisdiction over that cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.752" offset="964378">Now, this is inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's analysis in this case, that a remand based upon 1367(c) is a remand based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because in its view an independent basis for that jurisdiction is lacking.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="239.617" offset="1063852">Isn't there something odd about saying if it's really fundamental like the presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction, that is not reviewable?</text>
            <text syncTime="254.377" offset="1122889">It's not disputed, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="258.329" offset="1138772">That if the district court says, I lack subject matter jurisdiction over, let's say, the RICO claim, as wrong as that might be, that would not be reviewable, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="glenn_w_rhodes" startTime="272.854" stopTime="289.133">
            <label>Mr. Glenn W. Rhodes</label>
            <text syncTime="272.854" offset="1196868">Justice Ginsburg, I agree with that, because if the court does say that I am remanding this because, either rightly or wrongly, I lack subject matter jurisdiction, then that would fall squarely within 1447(c) and (d).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="289.133" stopTime="341.483">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="289.133" offset="1261965">Though that could be a very grave error and yet, on a matter of discretion, that that would be reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.691" offset="1308150">And I appreciate your statutory argument, but it just seems odd to think that Congress would want to be firm that if the -- if the remand is for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, wrong or right, no review; but if it's a discretionary exercise -- I could keep this, but I choose not to -- that that is reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.402" offset="1387039">That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to say the judge who could keep it or remand it, that that action is reviewable, but the action of saying I don't have jurisdiction, when indeed the court did have jurisdiction, is just totally immune from review.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="glenn_w_rhodes" startTime="341.483" stopTime="495.685">
            <label>Mr. Glenn W. Rhodes</label>
            <text syncTime="341.483" offset="1471363">I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg, that that seems rather confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.637" offset="1491947">I would address my answer in this way: The review ban of 1447(d) arose in the situations where apparently Congress wanted to -- to inhibit the abuse by those seeking only to delay the case by filing a motion for remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.322" offset="1610752">For example, a case that is filed in State court that clearly expresses no Federal question or diversity issue, yet the defendant, in order to delay the case, will then remove it to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.617" offset="1675849">In those situations, Congress wants to prevent those kinds of frivolous removals to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.223" offset="1714301">But here, in our particular case -- and maybe -- let me back up a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.293" offset="1742618">Maybe we should look at that in a different way, because even though you may have a legitimate basis for removing the case to Federal court and the district court disagrees with you, perhaps the better policy is that those types of remands should not be reviewable, even though sometimes a district court is going to get them wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.992" offset="1833420">But in this particular case, there was a Federal RICO claim asserted against us in State court, and as a defendant we were not removing that case on some frivolous basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.204" offset="1898203">We were removing it because we were entitled to be in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.239" offset="1914399">It was only after the district judge dismissed the Federal RICO count -- and there was no motion for remand on this case filed by Respondents -- the district court sua sponte decided that he was not going to exercise his power to hear this case because he thought there were legitimate State law claims and he remanded on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.806" offset="2020665">Now, that's a discretionary remand, and normally we would be arguing that where discretion is exercised by a district court, it should be reviewable for an abuse of discretion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="495.685" stopTime="560.710">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="495.685" offset="2088166">But wouldn't it be -- I mean, here the district judge said: I got rid of the RICO claim; all that's left are State law claims, and there's no Federal interest in this case anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.896" offset="2157025">They're all State law claims, they belong in State court, good-bye.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.114" offset="2177923">I could keep it, I choose not to, because it isn't a sound use of the resources of the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.906" offset="2221077">Now, even if you're right that this is a discretionary decision, so you can't say no jurisdiction because the discretion implies that there is power, isn't it 99 cases out of 100 that the court of appeals, assuming reviewability, will say, we should defer to the district judges on questions of this nature, the district judge's decision that this isn't worth the time of the Federal court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="glenn_w_rhodes" startTime="560.710" stopTime="575.820">
            <label>Mr. Glenn W. Rhodes</label>
            <text syncTime="560.710" offset="2348241">I'm not sure about the number of -- percentage of cases that -- that there is going to be a decision by the appellate court to say we shouldn't interfere in that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="575.820" stopTime="620.416">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="575.820" offset="2408741">But wouldn't you -- as a practical judgment, the Federal claim is gone, there is pendent jurisdiction -- or it's now supplemental jurisdiction -- over the State claim, but the district court is told by Congress: It's your call; it's a matter of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.681" offset="2484182">And the judge gives one of the reasons that's enumerated, that reason being that the State claims are overwhelming in this case, the RICO claim is dismissed, thinking it was worthless, so it's a State case.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.528" offset="2567565">Why would a court of appeals overturn such a judgment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="glenn_w_rhodes" startTime="620.416" stopTime="677.251">
            <label>Mr. Glenn W. Rhodes</label>
            <text syncTime="620.416" offset="2587105">I think, Justice Ginsburg, I can give you an answer to that because there is a recent case that's in our brief, the Brookshire case from the Fifth Circuit, where the district court exercised jurisdiction over Federal and supplemental claims, and did that for quite a while and ruled on a number of dispositive motions; and then basically on the eve of trial, after resolving the Federal claim, remanded it back to State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.220" offset="2714269">The Fifth Circuit, because it had the ability to review that, under the statutory construction, was able to review that on the basis of an abuse of discretion and said that the district court had definitely abused its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.246" offset="2782396">After retaining jurisdiction for that length of time and then returning it to State court, that was a waste of judicial resources.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="677.251" stopTime="721.079">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="677.251" offset="2814474">But that -- because you'd would have to retread the same ground in the State court that had already been covered in the Federal court, but that's not the kind of case that was presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.976" offset="2857315">I know the case has lingered for a long time, but there was no processing of those State law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.647" offset="2888035">The judge concentrated on RICO, threw it out, and said, the rest of the claims I'm not interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.653" offset="2920009">So it's not a case like the Fifth Circuit where there was a large investment of Federal court energy and time, and sending it back would mean going over once again what had already transpired in the Federal court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="glenn_w_rhodes" startTime="721.079" stopTime="779.867">
            <label>Mr. Glenn W. Rhodes</label>
            <text syncTime="721.079" offset="2989704">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.198" offset="2998168">This case is different because what the -- what the district court had labeled as legitimate State law claims as to, for example, inventorship, we argued are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court, and that is why we appealed to the Federal Circuit in order to have that issue resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.830" offset="3092731">Here, if we went back to State court, we would be in the position of having to argue to the State court that the State court lacked jurisdiction to hear that claim because it was something that was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.875" offset="3160963">It seems that in this particular situation it would be better to have the Federal Circuit to pass upon the exclusivity of the inventorship issue under the patent laws rather than have to go back to State court and work back up through the State court system to have that resolved.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="779.867" stopTime="814.290">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="779.867" offset="3224910">Could you explain why that is a Federal question?</text>
            <text syncTime="784.188" offset="3242151">It's a dispute over the ownership of this invention, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="790.508" offset="3267438">So it's not a question of the validity of a patent or infringement of a patent?</text>
            <text syncTime="798.948" offset="3301188">It's just the invention is like any res, and two parties are disputing about ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.255" offset="3350403">Why is -- why does that become a Federal case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="glenn_w_rhodes" startTime="814.290" stopTime="879.833">
            <label>Mr. Glenn W. Rhodes</label>
            <text syncTime="814.290" offset="3362628">It became a Federal question because in our view it arose under the patent laws because when they filed their complaint, even though they couched it in terms of purely State law claims, they did allege that we had falsely claimed to be the inventors; and the basis for that claim that we falsely claimed to be the inventors was the oath and declaration that was filed in connection with our patent applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.011" offset="3497420">So what they were raising was an issue with respect to our ability to claim to be the inventors of what we claimed in our U.S. patent applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.104" offset="3553844">Therefore, since that falls squarely under our entitlement to -- to inventorship, of what we claim to be the inventors, under Article I, section 8, it seemed to us that that clearly fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.057" offset="6789684">So you can't -- you can't say, well, Thermtron had a result that we can limit to Thermtron's own unusual facts, because the Court gave a rationale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.769" offset="6860528">And the Court drastically limited 1447(d) when it said 1447(d) has to be read consonant with 1447(c), and 1447(c) deals with only two kinds of remands, one for defective removal and the other for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.893" offset="7016950">The Court in Thermtron did give a rationale, and the rationale that it gave was that it viewed -- the opinion for the Court by Justice White -- viewed 1447(c) as being the sole source of Federal remand power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.152" offset="7082047">And as the Court noticed in the ensuing 30, 40 -- excuse me -- yes, 40-odd years, there have been a number of other sources of remand power recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.012" offset="7145472">And we see no reason why the holding in Thermtron should not be overruled but be updated to recognize that -- that the spirit of what the Court held in that case would be served and would be harmonized with the review bar as it has existed lo these 120 odd-years, would be served by expanding the -- excuse me, contracting the reach of Thermtron so that it is not simply 1447(c) remands, but any remand authorized by statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.295" offset="8162576">In Things Remembered, it was simply the fact that the review bar was held to apply to a remand, even according -- under another statute, and, of course, recognizing that there are now other statutory bases for remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.339" offset="8230808">The interesting thing about 1452 -- and Justice Ginsburg, I believe that you wrote the concurrence on this -- is that 1452 provides for remand on any equitable ground and that such remands are not subject to review by appeal or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.134" offset="8301965">So 1452, again, expresses, I think, a trend in the thinking of Congress, if there is such a thing as the thinking of Congress, that -- that the review bar will be expanded and will even include such discretionary decisions by a district court as any equitable ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.647" offset="13268052">I just had a few quick points that I'd like to bring up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.800" offset="13292607">First, I would just like to reiterate that when Congress enacted 1367, that gave it Article III jurisdiction in those matters, just as 1331 and 1332 do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.608" offset="13347882">I would also like to reiterate that -- that stare decisis should be maintained over this statutory interpretation because it has proved to be workable, rather than not workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.051" offset="13405665">Again, the circuit courts -- even though as Mr. Chief Justice has iterated that they have to follow this, they have found it to be a workable framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.341" offset="13450804">And, again, as the Court expressed in Powerex, they agree that in Quackenbush that Thermtron was not altered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.281" offset="13490510">And Congress has -- has seemingly ratified this Court's interpretation in Thermtron, and as it has been applied in Quackenbush.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.522" offset="13539516">I suppose, though, if it would be an abuse of discretion for the district court to retain jurisdiction, then maybe there is -- there never was jurisdiction, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.515" offset="13595523">You said they have discretion to exercise or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.801" offset="13604613">Well, if it turns out they don't have discretion to exercise -- you know, because it's a huge State claim and a tiny Federal claim -- why wouldn't that properly be regarded as an absence of jurisdiction?</text>

            <label>Mr. Glenn W. Rhodes</label>
            <text syncTime="3384.906" offset="13645051">My response to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that until a court decides that it was an abuse of discretion, the district court had jurisdiction under 1367(c) to either exercise that power or not exercise that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.438" offset="13731150">And unless there's any further questions for me, I ask that the -- this be remanded to the Federal Circuit to decide on the merits of the appeal.</text>
