            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="28">Justice Scalia has our opinion this morning in case 07-9712, Puckett versus United States.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="8.485" offset="33883">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.423" offset="57706">James Puckett was indicted on one count of armed bank robbery and one count of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.958" offset="95845">Instead of going to trial, he negotiated a plea bargain with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.666" offset="114653">In exchange for his guilty plea on each count, the Government agreed that Puckett was entitled to a three-level reduction in offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines in recognition of his acceptance of responsibility for the crime spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.373" offset="173481">That's a basis for reducing the offense level.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.930" offset="191662">And he also -- and the Government also agreed to ask the judge to sentence Puckett at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.911" offset="227607">However, before Puckett was sentenced and while he was on release, he assisted another man in a scheme to defraud the United States Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.297" offset="273164">As a result, the Government retreated from its earlier position, which had been expressed in a motion before the District Court that Puckett was entitled to the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.828" offset="319244">Instead, the Government argued that no reduction was in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.532" offset="338052">The District Judge observing that it was “so rare as to be unknown” to give the reduction to a defendant who had committed crimes subsequent to those for which he was being sentenced declined to award the reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.858" offset="403359">On appeal, Puckett argued for the first time that the Government had broken the plea -- the plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.511" offset="433974">The Government acknowledged that he had done so but maintained that Puckett was not entitled to a remedy for the breach because he had forfeited the claim by failing to raise it before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.840" offset="487368">Indeed, Puckett's counsel had neither objected during sentencing that the Government was in violation of its plea bargain commitments nor had moved to withdraw Puckett's guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.424" offset="533657">The Court of Appeals agreed with the Government that the claim had been forfeited and denied relief because Puckett could not demonstrate especially in light of the District Judge's comments that the breach had affected his ultimate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.148" offset="584544">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.248" offset="596978">If a litigant believes that error has occurred in a federal criminal proceeding, he must object in order to preserve the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.092" offset="628325">Unpreserved claims cannot be pressed on appeal except to the extent allowed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="166.223" offset="664897">That rule allows review if an appellant shows error that was clear or obvious and caused him prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.392" offset="697497">The Court has discretion to correct such an error if it seriously affected the fairness, integrity or reputation of the judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.047" offset="740129">This tough standard serves important interest in judicial efficiency by inducing timely objections which in turn give district courts the opportunity to adjudicate and sometimes to eliminate the -- the claims of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.543" offset="806167">That has the effect of eliminating some unnecessary appeals, facilitating review in those claims that do proceed to appeal and preventing litigants from playing dog in the manger, keeping silent until they see that the case goes against them and then raising the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.146" offset="892580">There is no reason to excuse defendants whose plea agreements were broken by the Government from the requirement of satisfying this plain-error test.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.463" offset="929778">Contrary, Puckett argues that the breach of a plea agreement made his guilty plea unknowing or involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.209" offset="964782">We think not, anymore than breach of any other contract renders the contract automatically void.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.150" offset="992577">When the Government reneges on a plea deal, the defendant is entitled to seek a remedy perhaps even withdrawal of his guilty plea, but the plea is not retroactively invalidated, nor do our prior cases resolve the matter in Puckett's favor, although we have said that preserved plea -- a plea breach claims cannot be ignored as harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.509" offset="1085990">We have never considered before whether unpreserved plea breach claims must be corrected notwithstanding the defendant's forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.283" offset="1125070">Puckett is also wrong to suggest that plain-error review would serve no purpose here and that applying it would be superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.753" offset="1159029">The salutary goal served by timely objections applies here as elsewhere and each of the prongs of plain-error review has floors in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.191" offset="1196750">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.821" offset="1207303">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
