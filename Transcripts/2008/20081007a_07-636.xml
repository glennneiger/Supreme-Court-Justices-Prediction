            <text syncTime="9.885" offset="144969">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As this Court has confined consideration of the matters before the Court to certiorari issue number 5 concerning qualified domestic relations orders, or QDROs as they are called, I will confine my argument to arguing that the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that the only way a divorcing spouse can waive the right to pension benefits is by executing a QDRO.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.731" offset="268372">I have four basic arguments to present today.</text>

            <text syncTime="58.333" offset="338798">I did so after stating that we believe that the matter was properly confined to the certiorari issue number three, but out of an abundance of caution and subject to objection I did respond to the argument leveled against us by I think it is five amici and by DuPont itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.969" offset="401283">We nevertheless, I prepared my original briefing on the merits to address the QDRO issue and that's where you see it focused.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="82.841" offset="436809">The problem is that is that if you, even if we hold for you on that issue, you could still lose on the plan documents rule, right.</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Furlow</label>
            <text syncTime="97.520" offset="495532">Well, Your Honor, I think that instead this Court might choose well to follow what the concurrence said in the recent LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg case, emphasizing that where the court of appeals below has not passed on the central issue of a case and where most of the fire that the one party is responding to comes from amici, that it is appropriate to remand the case to that court so that that court may pass on the central issue, especially in the situation where, as here, the Fifth Circuit did not even mention the plan document's role, but based its decision solely on a misinterpretation of the QDRO language.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.538" offset="651536">Of course, here, in the interest of candor, Dupont did in fact address in brief format -- a page or to, several pages -- in its motion for summary judgment the plan document's role and raised that matter again in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.923" offset="709110">It's just the Fifth Circuit did not consider or pass on that because it relied solely on Dupont's argument that the Fifth Circuit should adhere to what it believed to be the Department of Treasury's interpretation of the anti-alienation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.808" offset="768669">The Department of the Treasury and the Department of Labor, now in a harmonized stance, have come forth and in their amicus for the government supports our position that the Fifth Circuit erred in its interpretation of the QDRO statute, and that's the position we take.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.027" offset="881518">But at the end, could you possibly say, why shouldn't we just go ahead and decide the substance, not as a technical matter.</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Furlow</label>
            <text syncTime="260.020" offset="1145459">Well, Your Honor, there was that provision for invoking another beneficiary and we only pointed out that indeed three days after the divorce, and consistent with his ex-wife's waiver of any right, title, claim and interest in this 401(k) plan in specific, and that was the very first item of the things that he retained as the plan participant in that divorce decree, he did in fact designate his sole daughter Kari Kennedy as his sole beneficiary in a change of form plan for one part of this very complex series of multiple plans -- of plan retirement benefits where he said that he would give -- that she would be his sole beneficiary; and the form there that DuPont drafted for him said that it invoked and superseded any and all prior designations, and was not limited to that one particular part 6 pension and retirements plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.836" offset="1368754">And so we submit it is a reasonable explanation, if he did not believe that his wife had waived any right, title and interest to invoke that beneficiary clause, pursuant to the Fifth Circuit's decision just six weeks beforehand in the Brandon v. Travelers International case that said that a waiver of ERISA benefits, welfare benefits mainly -- but ERISA waiver of benefits, a voluntary waiver was enforceable, was valid and could be enforced at summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.079" offset="1477736">We believe his counsel, you know, were aware of that in formulating, you know, this waiver of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.590" offset="1503754">Even if that didn't take care of Liv Kennedy's knowing, voluntary, attorney-negotiated, court-approved, signed-by-her waiver of any right, title, claim and interest in his pension benefits, then we believe he may have believed as a layman that by signing that beneficiary designation form prepared by DuPont, that he had indeed superseded and revoked all prior designations.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.652" offset="1632068">It's odd that he revoked as to one plan but not the 501(k) plan, as I understand.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.571" offset="1683686">He almost certainly saw no reason to revoke that which his wife had just four days before voluntarily waived any right, title, claim and interest to in terms of the divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.911" offset="1729034">He certainly would have expected that her word would be her bond and that it wouldn't turn out to be a junk bond as it turned out to be when years later she repudiated her own voluntary waiver; and that's just one of the issues that we address.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.042" offset="2121603">And it is critical here, Your Honor, that when they chose to make this -- you know, when they chose to pay the beneficiary, they were working on a test case right there from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.442" offset="2163190">And if you look at their paralegal's letter, who actually notifies the estate that they are going to disregard the voluntary test case, they refer to DuPont's success in raising this issue before.</text>

            <text syncTime="1249.469" offset="5103323">And specifically DuPont then goes one bridge too far going way beyond that to say that these ever meetable ever changeable beneficiary changes thousands of them constitute documents where the Ninth Circuit conity substitutes of what constitutes plan documents in the salaried employees of Hughes versus Hughes administrator case and said that a list of the participants and their addresses could not be considered a plan document cause it did not correspond with that detailed listing of the plan document under Section 1024 and 1025.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.360" offset="5226830">Indeed under Section 29 U.S.C. Section 1025, Your Honors, if these are plan documents then the administrator has a duty to disclose them to any person, participant, or beneficiary who asked and as the Ninth Circuit pointed out there is substantial dangers there of going way beyond what Congress, a very liberal Watergate Congress in 1974, intended ERISA to be, which is a protection for participants and beneficiaries, not for plan administrators.</text>

            <text syncTime="1367.978" offset="5577289">We agree with Petitioner that the Fifth Circuit misinterpreted both the anti-alienation provision and the QDRO exception to that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.428" offset="5611144">But we disagree with Petitioner's further submission that merely because ERISA does not forbid waivers in the divorce context or otherwise, that a plan administrator may be required as a matter of Federal common law to recognize such waivers even when those waivers conflict with the beneficiary designation the plan administrator has on file.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.170" offset="6470050">The -- the plan documents in this case do specify a procedure for determining who is to receive benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.286" offset="6546536">And so, because the plan sets out a procedure for changing beneficiary designations, we think that it would be inappropriate to look beyond that to require plan administrators to look to extrinsic documents in order to determine whether one of them overrides that designation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.322" offset="7438670">We think that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.305" offset="7442641">It's well within the settled doctrine of an alternative ground for affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.300" offset="7462599">It was raised below, and the Fifth Circuit has decided the issue in other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1843.956" offset="7481198">So we know what the Fifth Circuit thinks about this issue, and, therefore, there is no point in a remand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.839" offset="8636750">This argument would prevail whether or not the purported waiver is deemed to be an assignment or alienation under 1056(d)(1) and (d)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.163" offset="8682099">Now, we think it is and I'll come back to that under the IRS regulation, but let me start with this alternative argument that's also made in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.253" offset="8710416">Under ERISA, a domestic relations order is either a qualified order or a nonqualified order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.627" offset="8739882">And ERISA expressly provides that if it's a nonqualified order, as it is here, the plan administrator may not pay benefits pursuant to that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.013" offset="8777498">Justice Scalia, since you're on page 21A, let's look at subparagraph (H)(iii).</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.556" offset="8803621">This is 21A of the red brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.338" offset="8810726">It provides that: If an order is not qualified, the plan administrator shall pay the benefits to the person or persons who would be entitled to such benefits if there had been no order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.567" offset="8867673">If there had been no order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.501" offset="8875405">In other words, the administrator disregards it and pays it to the person -- this is in (iii), Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.435" offset="8903199">Contrast that with subparagraph (H)(ii) right above it, where the order is qualified: The administrator shall pay the benefits to the person entitled thereto under the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.196" offset="8958161">So, it gives you two choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.901" offset="8965057">If it's a qualified order, the plan must pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2219.931" offset="8985119">Well, that doesn't make too much sense, does it, where all that happens is it's just waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.506" offset="8999434">The wife waived the amount because when she waived the amount, she doesn't give it to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.751" offset="9020437">She just doesn't take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.253" offset="9026393">So it goes to the beneficiary -- it goes to the person who made up the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.111" offset="9045828">It's a little hard to pay to him, because he is dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.751" offset="9056381">So I mean if you read it literally, it doesn't seem to apply, these (ii) and (iii), to the case before us, which is a case of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.841" offset="9092744">And of course the argument, yes, she makes is that throughout the law, waiver is treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.368" offset="9122941">And if it weren't, you'd have to pay gift tax, for example, when you waive a benefit that's given to you by someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.615" offset="9163901">And so let's interpret this and make sense of the language you quoted, and consistent with the rest of the law to say a waiver is waivered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.042" offset="11241576">And I would say only two things about that: One is at JA 62, and if you look at it, it says in the title and it says in the body of the document that this applies to the pension and retirement plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.117" offset="11285880">We don't think anyone could have thought that it applied to other plans and that William therefore was changing the beneficiary as to those other plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.250" offset="12118455">We think Liv's purported waiver here was an assignment or alienation within the IRS definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.046" offset="12145622">The IRS regulation is reprinted at page 15 of the body of the red brief, and it provides that assignment or alienation is defined to include any direct or indirect arrangement whereby a party acquires an interest from the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.914" offset="12217093">And I've left out the not -- the not-critical language for present purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.190" offset="12238200">So it talks about an indirect arrangement whereby a party acquires an interest from the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.407" offset="12259098">Now, the government argues that that definition requires that the beneficiary, first, must direct the transfer and, second, it must direct it to a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.482" offset="12303297">The government's argument rests not on the language of the regulation that I just read but on a legal argument that this is what terms meant at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.492" offset="12343421">But that position simply can't be squared with the language of the regulation.</text>
