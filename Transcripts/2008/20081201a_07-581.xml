            <text syncTime="9.024" offset="141521">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There are three reasons why this Court should reverse the Second Circuit's blanket ban on collectively bargained, arbitral forum -- forum selection clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.146" offset="202021">First, the Second Circuit ignored section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, by which Congress empowered unions to bargain on behalf of their employees over anything germane to the working environment, including methods of workplace dispute resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.420" offset="283105">The forum in which an ADEA claim is heard falls squarely in that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.289" offset="314556">Indeed, forbidding unions from bargaining about the procedural right to an arbitral forum will carve a judicial exception into the labor law permitting employers to bypass the union and deal directly with their employees, defeating Congress's national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.514" offset="407448">Second, the Second Circuit failed to consider Congress's strong endorsement of workplace arbitration contained in both the FAA and section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.415" offset="455095">Third, the Second Circuit erroneously and exclusively relied on Alexander versus Gardner-Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.833" offset="492711">Gardner-Denver is a case about claim preclusion, not about enforcing an agreement to arbitrate a statutory claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.520" offset="1115470">The Second Circuit did not consider it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.135" offset="6397952">First, a collective bargaining agreement gives the union exclusive control over workers' grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.443" offset="6427209">Second, unions have inherent conflicts of interest with respect to individual statutory antidiscrimination rights; and third, unions lack authority to serve as gatekeepers of individual workers' substantive ADEA rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.393" offset="6498994">With respect to the first point, a collective bargaining agreement generally gives the union exclusive control over whether to bring grievances on behalf of workers and how such grievances are pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.713" offset="6552283">In such circumstances, which is this case, the worker does not evince the requisite agreement to arbitrate and control over the arbitral forum to satisfy this Court's standards in Gilmer for effectively vindicating the worker's statutory antidiscrimination rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.166" offset="6714034">We've never found a collective bargaining agreement that gives the kind of interpretation that Mr. Salvatore offered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.600" offset="6739843">Now, is it theoretically possible that a collective bargaining agreement would confer on individuals the rights this Court said in Gilmer are necessary to effectively vindicate that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.113" offset="6785923">I would acknowledge it's theoretically possible, but it has to be done within the confines of whether there is actual consent by the individual to the arbitration, whether the individual has control over the mechanisms of arbitration, and whether or not the structure of the arbitral forum effectively vindicates the individual's substantive rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.472" offset="6947359">Here, because this is a discrimination claim, unions are often brought as defendants in such claims, particularly in circumstances as here, where the union agreed to the conditions that gave rise to the discrimination on the basis of age by these workers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.163" offset="7046102">I understood you elsewhere to be arguing that there had to be the kind of knowing, intelligent, and individual waiver, which I would suppose a collective bargaining agreement will never include.</text>
