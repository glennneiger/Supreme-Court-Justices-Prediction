            <label>Mr. Gen Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="7.870" offset="139995">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Six years ago this Court rejected the Navajo Nation's claim for damages in connection with the same action that is before the Court here, the Secretary's approval of amendments to the tribe's mineral lease in the mid-1980s.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.948" offset="208332">The Court held there that in order for the United States to be held liable under the Tucker Act or the Indian Tucker Act, the claimant must identify at the threshold a specific rights-creating or duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescription that the government has allegedly violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.279" offset="285654">The Court found no warrant in any relevant statute or regulation to impose liability on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.366" offset="317942">In particular, the Court concluded that the approval of the royalty rates in the tribe's lease was governed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, or IMLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.157" offset="357125">Looking at IMLA's framework, the Court held that there was no, quote, "textual basis", close quote, in any pertinent statutory or regulatory provision that required the Secretary to insist that the tribe negotiate for a higher rate.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="78.083" offset="420864">Well, it said "pertinent or relevant", but surely that's limited to the statutory provisions that we examined in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="84.987" offset="448449">But I think the way to look at it is what the Court said, that it found no warrant in any relevant statute or regulation, and it discussed not just IMLA but several other statutes which -- which did have to do with the economic -- excuse me -- the economic terms of leases, but--</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="114.720" stopTime="325.907">
            <label>Mr. Gen Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="114.720" offset="567359">Two things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.954" offset="572270">The government's question presented was that the Court could not find the United States liable or -- was whether the Court could find the United States liable without finding a violation of IMLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.778" offset="615633">And therefore, the premise of the question was, without finding a violation of IMLA, the United States could not be liable, and the Court found no violation of IMLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.531" offset="646666">But beyond that, the tribe's principal submission in this Court was that the United States had control through a network of statutes, including the ones they rely on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.673" offset="691179">But the Court also itself on page 30 of its brief in that case identified the relevant statutes as being IMLA and the other two that this Court discussed and the general introduction to the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.349" offset="753873">So I think the structure of the Court's opinion, looking at the way the tribe serves it up, the Court said there has to be a specific violation of a -- of a statutory regulatory prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.474" offset="794415">The Court found that the relevant one was IMLA, and it found no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.608" offset="810924">And therefore -- and the Court also said the tribe's claim, not simply arguments made in favor of the claim, must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.531" offset="842585">But if the Court concludes that its prior decision did not absolutely foreclose the litigation, we think it's clear that the framework that this Court announced in -- or reaffirmed in Navajo 1 itself does foreclose the claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.743" offset="911444">As I said, the Court concluded that IMLA is the statute that governs the approval of royalty terms in coal leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.647" offset="943104">On remand, the Federal Circuit relied on two other statutes addressing other subjects, the Surface Mining Reclamation and Control Act, which has to do with the regulation of environmental issues, matters that may arise in connection with a coal lease, and the Hopi-Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950, which set in motion a general governmental program to rehabilitate and improve the economic life of the Navajo and Hopi Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.416" offset="1054177">But neither of those statutes had anything to do with the approval of the economic terms of coal leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.237" offset="1081448">That was governed by IMLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.272" offset="1089599">So the fact that the Federal Circuit on remand held the United States liable on the basis of two statutes that have nothing to do with coal leasing, minus the statute that did have something to do with coal leasing, in our view shows how far the Federal Circuit has strayed from this Court's teachings.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.566" offset="1158771">But beyond that, we think it's a fortiori that the court of appeals erred in its alternative holding, which was that the United States could be held liable on the basis of general common law principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.458" offset="1206314">The Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act provide that the United States may be liable only for a violation of an act of Congress or a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.480" offset="1242363">And it was for that reason that this Court stated in Navajo -- in the Navajo case that there has to be a violation of a specific statutory or regulatory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.020" offset="1284577">Even as a general matter, under this Court's jurisprudence, there is only a very limited role for Federal common law, but that is especially so when what we are talking about here is liability for damages under a waiver of sovereign immunity, and the usual sovereign immunity principles have to cast considerable doubt on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.766" offset="1363571">Only an act of Congress or a regulation adopted pursuant to congressionally conferred authority can provide for the payment of money out of the Federal Treasury under our Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.040" offset="1636603">--Well, what I was asking was whether there's some doctrine that the -- that the trustee -- that the Secretary acts in a capacity, a fiduciary capacity as a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.877" offset="1663979">If that doctrine were out there, then that might be the basis for saying that it's a sufficient foundation for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.817" offset="1699715">I was just asking, is that doctrine there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="399.833" stopTime="479.785">
            <label>Mr. Gen Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="399.833" offset="1707865">No, not -- not in the way you put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.619" offset="1714970">But there are cases that certainly talk about the Secretary has trust responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.506" offset="1738480">But there are a lot of ways in which that concept can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.541" offset="1750706">It can be used in a political sense in that the United States Government, through treaties or a general sense of moral responsibility, should look out for the Indians, and in the day-to-day administration of Indian affairs to contemplate a trust responsibility is simply to mean that the United States has a special relationship and -- and should deal in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.656" offset="1843075">And under the Administrative Procedure Act, if there is -- if there is an action the United States takes under a statute that governs Indian affairs, that would be -- that would be subject to judicial review under the general principles, is it arbitrary and capricious under normal principles, does substantial evidence sustain the determination?</text>
            <text syncTime="452.285" offset="1917680">But, particularly in a suit for money damages under the -- under the Tucker Act and where Congress has said there has to be a violation of a money-mandating statute or -- or regulation, general common law principles do not suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.811" offset="1979747">As I said, for money damages, only Congress or an executive agency under -- acting pursuant to congressional authority under the Constitution can provide for the payment of -- of money out of the Federal Treasury.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.587" offset="2046830">Are you suggesting that the trust principles do not set a standard to which the Secretary is bound, or simply that they don't constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity?</text>

            <text syncTime="496.143" offset="2093014">The general trust principles, at least -- at least again under Tucker Act jurisprudence, general trust principles are not what establish the Secretary's duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.368" offset="2145991">It's the acts of Congress that impose duties on the Secretary in this area as in any others, or regulations the Secretary has prescribed under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.574" offset="2178800">Now, under this Court's jurisprudence, the Court has said that the notion of trust is relevant at the second stage of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.330" offset="2221850">The first stage is the threshold requirement that there be a specific statute or regulation that imposes duties or rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.972" offset="2260407">If the Court finds that, then at the second stage, as this Court has held in Mitchell 2 and indicated in Navajo as well, that may be relevant to determine whether those specific duty-imposing statutes in turn also impose monetary liability on the United States for violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.967" offset="2772407">This lease was renegotiated in connection with a clause in the lease that allowed adjustments for reasonable rates, which is not the same thing as maximizing the tribe's -- the tribe's revenues, so the Secretary had a regulation at the time of 10 cents per ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.781" offset="2843564">The Secretary now has a regulation that says the minimum royalty rate will be 12.5 percent, which, as Court pointed out in Navajo 1, is the standard royalty rate for Federal and tribal leases throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.689" offset="2899257">Now, what is significant, in further response to your question, is that regulation states that that minimum rate is 12.5 percent unless the Secretary determines that a lower rate would be in the best interest of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.864" offset="2955995">So the way this works then, the way the Secretary has implemented it, it's basically up to the tribe to negotiate something at or above the minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.370" offset="2989955">If it's below the minimum that the Secretary's prescribed, the Secretary has to make a judgment that that going lower, maybe because of geological conditions or whatever, is in the best interest of the Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="740.513" offset="3070516">That's an IMLA regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.663" offset="3075114">The general regulations that implement the Rehabilitation Act have a similar provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.233" offset="3093400">They don't talk about royalties, which I think is telling because royalties have to do with coal leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.971" offset="3112417">They talk about -- they require that there be a fair rental for -- for property, not a maximum rental but a fair rental.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.826" offset="3147839">And then it has the same sort of thing, that if it's going to be below the fair market value it has to be in the best interest of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.163" offset="3173125">And I think it's instructive that I know there's been an argument that this lease is governed by the -- by the Rehabilitation Act rather than IMLA, notwithstanding what this Court held in Navajo 1 six years ago, but in 1999 when Secretary Babbitt, who joined the brief arguing that this is covered by the Rehabilitation Act, approved the amendments to the lease in 1999, he approved it under the IMLA regulations and he specifically said that because the minimum royalty rate is 12.5 percent -- he is quoting the applicable regulation --</text>
            <text syncTime="801.753" offset="3315545">"I do not have to decide whether the royalty rate is in the best interest of the Indians. "</text>
            <text syncTime="806.807" offset="3335711">He went on to say: "But I think it is".</text>
            <text syncTime="808.873" offset="3343966">So Secretary Babbitt's approval of those amendments really explains the way the Secretary has implemented the statutory scheme, and we think that's certainly well within the Secretary's discretion under a statute that did not impose any limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.535" offset="3410631">With respect to the Rehabilitation Act, the general leasing provision of that act, as we've explained in our brief, does not apply to mineral leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.958" offset="3444276">That continued to be governed by IMLA after 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.077" offset="3456815">But even if it did, there is nothing in section 5 that imposes any more specific duties with respect to royalty terms or any other terms than IMLA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.865" offset="3499969">Section 5 has to do with surface -- leases for surface users, business purposes basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.638" offset="3527032">And that was put in there because at the time there was no provision for long-term leases if someone wanted to bring a surface commercial venture onto a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.244" offset="3565484">But the last -- the last sentence of section 5 of the -- of the act on page 171a of the petition appendix says that:</text>
            <text syncTime="877.820" offset="3619819">"Nothing contained in section 5 shall affect the authority -- shall be construed to repeal or affect the authority under any other act of Congress. "</text>
            <text syncTime="885.823" offset="3651793">So section -- and the other act of Congress here is IMLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.961" offset="3672377">I think it's also instructive to point out not only did this Court hold the last time around that the lease was governed by IMLA, that -- that was the tribe's position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.935" offset="3724204">Its proposed findings of fact indeed in the Court of Federal Claims, pages 524 and 525 of the joint appendix, said that the lease was governed by IMLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.160" offset="3765164">But the textual dispositive point is this lease couldn't have been entered into under the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.330" offset="3789824">The lease in this case provided that the lease would be for a term of 10 years and then subject to a further extension for as long as minerals are produced in paying quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.054" offset="3836740">That precise language is repeated in the lease, which shows that it was under IMLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.256" offset="3853563">Under section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act, the lease could only be for an initial term of 25 years and then a further term of 25 more years.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.612" offset="3886895">It wouldn't have allowed for this sort of lease here and indeed, because the initial lease term here was 10 years and then could have only been 25 more years under -- under the Rehab Act, this lease would have had to expire in 1999, and yet it was amended at that time and continues in effect and mining continues under it.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.819" offset="4047809">The form on which the lease is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.938" offset="4056273">I think what they said is there were several provisions that appear in regulations under general leasing statutes that are in these, are in these leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.977" offset="4096397">They aren't in these leases -- one has to do with the property can't be used for unlawful purposes, and I'm forgetting what the second one was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.500" offset="4134536">But it wouldn't be unusual that the -- that the Secretary might borrow or a tribe might borrow provisions from other leases and put them in this lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.457" offset="4174346">This is -- again, IMLA provides for negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.325" offset="4185840">So the parties are free to put in particular provisions of lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.694" offset="4203290">So that the fact that there might be things that would parallel what were in the other leases we don't think is really dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.448" offset="4230248">Also, the other significant thing is that the lease itself incorporates or refers to by reference the IMLA regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.406" offset="4270164">So even if somehow this lease were thought to be governed by section 5, even though that wasn't what it was issued under, the IMLA regulations would control, and this Court already held in Navajo 1 that those IMLA regulations, which are in the lease, do not impose any -- did not impose any duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval, approval of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.204" offset="4373295">I should also point out that when the -- we cite this in our -- in our brief, that at the time the lease amendments were approved in 1987 the Solicitor's Office did -- did a legal review of the propriety of the lease amendments and that legal review expressly says that the lease was entered into under -- under IMLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.136" offset="4456991">So I think the circumstances are really overwhelming that -- that it was entered into under IMLA and that the Rehabilitation Act lease provision does not have anything to do with this lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.461" offset="4506311">And the more general emanations from the Rehabilitation Act that the tribe seeks to rely on here are too general, in short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.650" offset="4547062">The Rehabilitation Act was enacted in 1950 in recognition that the plight of the Navajo and Hopi was very serious, and Congress undertook to study resources and put in infrastructure and that sort of thing, and part of it was to have programs -- excuse me -- studies to determine what the tribe's coal resources were, and that was done, and this lease grew out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.467" offset="4654373">But that doesn't mean that it was in any way governed by the Rehabilitation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.693" offset="4819257">And we think in doing so that the -- that the Court should reiterate the analytical framework that it put forward in -- in its decision the last time around so that there will be no mistaking the way these cases are to be handled in the Federal circuit in the future by requiring at the threshold, a -- as I said, a specific statutory or regulatory provision that imposes duties and not in particular looking at general notions of common law that -- that might arise out of -- out of some sort of -- some sort of factual control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.249" offset="4949452">The last thing I wanted to say is that the Federal Circuit also relied on the Surface Mining Reclamation and Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.502" offset="4982471">And that -- and that, as I said, has to do with environmental issues in connection with -- with Indian leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.887" offset="5003995">The Federal Circuit relied on a provision that says that the -- that the Secretary should include in any Indian leases additional provisions that were proposed by the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.362" offset="5045896">But that's additional provisions in addition to other environmental provisions stemming from the statute that had to be in the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.765" offset="5075571">It was -- it was just quite a stretch for the -- for the court to conclude that that somehow controlled economic terms of the leases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.578" offset="5150804">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I would like to start with Justice Alito's question because he said: Doesn't section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act specifically require the Secretary to approve this lease?</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.053" offset="5196675">And Mr. Kneedler conceded that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.820" offset="5207751">And so then the question is: Doesn't that create some kind of a duty?</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.123" offset="5221021">And it seems to me clearly it does, just as the Court I think implicitly said in Navajo 1, the difference between Navajo 1 and Navajo 2 being that this Court then went on to examine IMLA, the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, and concluded that IMLA very specifically for the entirety of Native Americans and for the entirety of Indian mineral leasing had a preference to ensure that the Indian tribes themselves would -- would attain a certain self sufficiency; that it essentially abdicated the responsibility of having to deal with individual negotiations and allowed it for the tribes to take over.</text>

            <text syncTime="2100.608" offset="8510882">It doesn't say it's limited to the following projects, and those projects have been set out with a set of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.543" offset="8530631">But the program itself is not -- is not limited that way and more fundamentally, it is completely inconsistent with that kind of time limitation on the statute overall that Congress would have repealed certain sections of this act, sections 9 and 10, after the 10-year period that expired if the statute didn't have any continuing implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.807" offset="8611715">It also would have meant that the leasing protections in section 5 had expired after 10 years, which seems to me quite inconsistent with the overall purpose here to accomplish that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.758" offset="13235493">But they were situations, special types of conveyances that the tribe was going to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.418" offset="13298186">The other was that the tribe could convey trust land to municipalities and that sort of thing, and what the statute says, thereafter the United States won't be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.791" offset="13335698">The United States was just making sure it was washing its hands of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.159" offset="13349177">Under section (a), we aren't saying that there could be no lease under which it could conceivably be for a business purpose in which the United States could be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.764" offset="13379584">If there was a regulation establishing a minimum floor and the lease terms went below that, then that might be a circumstance in which liability could be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.620" offset="13415006">But otherwise, Justice Breyer is completely correct: This statute on its face imposes no more of a duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval of whatever leases are covered than IMLA imposed on the Secretary with respect to -- with respect to mineral leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.530" offset="13474565">And -- and another important point is, as this Court pointed out in the Cotton Petroleum and Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, the IMLA was enacted to bring uniformity to mineral leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.088" offset="13516884">And the notion that Congress would have implicitly wanted to carve the Navajo and Hopi out of that general authorization and that preexisting set of regulations and cover it by -- by a provision like this, we think is just not consistent with the way Congress has dealt with mineral leases over the -- over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.966" offset="13588355">I also just wanted to come back to this idea of -- of imposing liability on the basis of the common law, because the example of what the Federal Circuit did in this case, with all respect to that court, we think strayed so far from what this Court laid down in Navajo that it's important for this Court, however it thinks it disposed of the case before, to make clear that liability cannot be imposed unless, as this Court said in Navajo, there is -- there is a specific rights-creating or duty-imposing language in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.104" offset="13716877">The theory that has been adopted in some lower court -- Federal Circuit decisions, is you can look at a hodgepodge of statutes, one dealing with environmental concerns, one dealing with rights-of-way, one dealing with this, add them all up and say the United States has control and, therefore, out of that sort of bucket of statutes, you can impose trust responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.566" offset="13794722">That's fundamentally inconsistent with the Tucker Act, which requires that the liability be based on the statutes themselves, and you have to look at each statute and each regulation that governs the United States in Indian affairs in the same way, under the Tucker Act, you would look at--</text>

            <text syncTime="3455.419" offset="13930141">I think that's not at all correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.253" offset="13937455">With respect to the approval of the lease terms in 1987 -- under a provision that provided for 12.5 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.211" offset="13985311">The tribe entered into two other leases at the very same time that are not the subject of this case, for 12.5 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.299" offset="14009657">That's the standard royalty rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.916" offset="14016136">And the tribe got other benefits from this as a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.851" offset="14027943">With respect to the arguments about what the Secretary did on -- on appeal, it's even clearer that all this information about the Secretary meeting with Peabody's lobbyist was before the Court before, and the Court found no violation of any statute or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.361" offset="14089906">But it's even clearer on remand, as we point out on page 22 of our reply brief, that the tribe was fully aware that the Secretary was not going to -- had -- had said the appeal was not going to be acted on and had sent the parties back to negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.020" offset="14148524">In fact, when Chairman Zah of the tribe opened the negotiations on August 30 of 1985, he said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.793" offset="14175692">"It appears that the Secretary wants us to take another shot at negotiating the lease. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.078" offset="14192828">He knew what had happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.517" offset="14222608">Well, what the -- what the Court of Federal Claims said along those lines was a legal conclusion, not a factual conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.152" offset="14245073">And the -- the facts as describe were what they were before and the court found no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.575" offset="14270777">And -- and as we say, it's clear factually on remand that the tribe knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.377" offset="14290004">But again, that was just -- it's not a factual determination that has to be taken as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.430" offset="14310170">For one thing, it was summary judgment, not factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.632" offset="14323022">But it does -- it was just a legal conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.767" offset="14335561">And at that, it was the sort of legal conclusion drawn from general notions of fiduciary responsibility, nothing that has been channeled or embodied or codified in a statute or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.725" offset="14387388">And we think to unleash the common law to regulate the day-to-day operations of a vast agency like the Interior Department, which has to operate by statutes and regulations, would be -- under Vermont Yankee and this Court's other jurisprudence, would be -- would be unwarranted for the courts to do and especially in a waiver of sovereign immunity under the -- under the Tucker Act, to impose damages liability for the violation of a procedural regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.042" offset="14488639">And, of course, the Court pointed out the last time that there was no prohibition against ex parte contacts for this sort of informal adjudication, as there isn't across -- across the board for government -- government activities.</text>
