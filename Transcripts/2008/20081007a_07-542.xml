            <text syncTime="32.102" offset="234809">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: More than 27 years ago in Belton this Court applied its prior decisions in Chimel and Robinson to the arrest of a recent occupant of an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.160" offset="283084">The Court sought to forge a workable straightforward rule that could be easily applied and predictably enforced by law enforcement officers in the field in this dangerous and dynamic situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.401" offset="332089">After careful consideration, this Court held that the passenger compartment of the vehicle was deemed to be under the immediate control of the arrestee.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.074" offset="366780">The Court also made clear that the search need only be a contemporaneous incident of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.744" offset="389454">There are three reasons, all well-established by this Court's case law, why officers, law enforcement officers, need not demonstrate a threat to their safety or need to preserve evidence prior to searching an automobile incident to arrest, even if all of the recent occupants of the vehicle have been arrested and secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.760" offset="477435">First, neither justification need exist in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.045" offset="498646">This Court has made clear in Robinson that a search incident to arrest requires no additional justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.984" offset="530411">It's the fact of arrest that justifies the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.353" offset="543890">Second, the search need only be a contemporaneous incident of the arrest or substantially contemporaneous with the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.375" offset="579939">Obviously a search can be contemporaneous even if the arrestee has been secured.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.955" offset="674294">Well, why isn't this situation more like the station house than it is like -- the Belton situation is the police apprehend the -- a driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.446" offset="728210">They are concerned about weapons, about being assaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.368" offset="759871">But here we have someone who is locked up inside a police car, handcuffed, can't go anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.141" offset="794979">That sounds to me more like the station house than it does the urgent situation where the police have a legitimate concern for their own safety.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.767" offset="857464">It's not remote in place or time because it -- it -- the arrest and the search occur in a short period of time at the scene of the -- of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.206" offset="895289">And while he -- the arrestee is secured to one degree or another, in Belton this Court wanted a workable, straightforward rule that officers could apply across the board and not have to look at particular facts and circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.847" offset="945863">So--</text>

            <text syncTime="210.097" offset="946803">And this is important, but you had three -- three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.330" offset="955789">One was the fact of the arrest; and, two, it must be contemporaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.846" offset="965820">And the third?</text>

            <text syncTime="215.365" offset="967910">--The third is requiring a justification is anathema to a bright-line rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.567" offset="984733">And that is precisely what this Court wanted in Belton, was a rule that law-enforcement officers would know how to apply from one case to another, that wouldn't vary based upon the particular facts of the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.195" offset="1055263">And -- and the problem that this case raises, I think, if anything more acutely than any of the others that we've had recently, is that it seems if -- if your position is -- is going to be accepted, to divorce the search totally from the justification for the Chimel rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.673" offset="1133108">And -- and at some point we've either got to say, all right, it's no longer a Chimel rule, there's some other justification for the bright-line rule; or we've got to say, to purport to apply the Chimel rule in a case like this, handcuffed in the back of the police car and so on, is -- is to turn the law into nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.522" offset="1224537">And -- and I -- I think we've got that choice in front of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.391" offset="1240001">Do we have a new and different rule, or do we apply Chimel and say, you just can't go this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.962" offset="1266333">This is like the station house.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.915" offset="3454140">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.735" offset="3481412">Belton relied on a factor that was not in Chimel, the need for an easily administratable rule in the commonly recurring incident of vehicle arrest and the search incident to that arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.227" offset="3531358">Justice Stewart who authored both Chimel and Belton recognized that over a decade of experience of Chimel had shown that the courts were in disarray, that courts had confronted similar fact circumstances and come to differing results, that officers in the field, confronted with the highly volatile and dangerous events surrounding a custodial arrest needed clear guidance to be able to govern their actions in these instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.527" offset="3632504">That makes total sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.227" offset="3639400">Unlike Chimel which occurred in a home and arises in a situation where the privacy interests are at their apex, in the Belton context, the search is of the passenger compartment of a vehicle, and this Court has repeatedly acknowledged that with respect to automobiles there is a considerably diminished or greatly are reduced expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.160" offset="3731038">Given the very real threats that officers face in discharging their duties on a day-to-day basis in this commonly recurring scene -- circumstances, Belton established a bright-line rule to be able to govern their conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.597" offset="11384811">And even though we know from police procedures that empirically that's not really true, we know that we can't -- the Petitioner can't cite a single instance where somebody has gone back to his car, grabbed a weapon, and attacked an officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.573" offset="11448759">And that, as Justice Breyer pointed out perhaps by his question, is one of the flaws of Belton that courts may continue to struggle with, but the bright-line doesn't change.</text>

            <text syncTime="2909.070" offset="11742689">But, importantly, officers have other tools that they can use, other than searching somebody's car when they don't have probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.064" offset="11810712">In this case, for example, they had -- they had four or five officers on scene, and the scene, objectively, according to the officers, was secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.769" offset="11837565">They said they had control of the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.219" offset="11843312">And that's an example of the use of police procedures that are available other than searching that establish officer safety and serve to protect our officers in the field without offending the Fourth Amendment.</text>
