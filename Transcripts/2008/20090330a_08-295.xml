            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="154687">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 1988, the Second Circuit decided in two separate decisions that a bankruptcy court exercising its core jurisdiction had properly confirmed the plan of reorganization that resolved present and future claims against Johns-Manville and the insurers who funded Manville's reorganization plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.208" offset="266282">Last year, despite its decades-old rulings to the contrary, the Second Circuit sustained a collateral attack on the confirmation order and held that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction back in 1986 to enjoin direct actions against Travelers, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="72.679" offset="396163">The Second Circuit said: The confirmation of the 1986 order stands, but that order did not encompass what was added in 2004; that is, that order dealt with the debtor, with Manville and the insurers' obligation to cover Manville's liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.264" offset="506504">The Second Circuit said: Now, this 2004 order, which concerns independent actions against insurers for their own wrong, was never encompassed in the order that they affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.046" offset="8149619">In 1988, in the MacArthur case, the Second Circuit relied on section 1334(d) as the jurisdictional basis for upholding the district -- the bankruptcy order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.151" offset="8190056">Section 1334(d), which is now recodified as 1334(e), has to do only with the disposition of the assets of the estate, the property of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.042" offset="8233629">And so, the Second Circuit order in 19 -- in 1988, which is the controlling legal authority on what the scope of the release was, went only to the property of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.850" offset="8284829">And so, I don't think that there was any understanding at the time by anyone that there was a release of claims that were independent of the property of the estate or made -- or had no hold upon or potential impact upon the property of the estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.644" offset="8352016">What it says in the release is it says: We are releasing or everybody is enjoined from bringing a suit for policy claims against Travelers, and a policy claim is any and all claims based upon, arising out of, or relating to any insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.427" offset="8447101">And then the bankruptcy judge, in thousands of findings, I guess, said that your lawsuits do relate to the relevant insurance policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.195" offset="9510181">Another view of jurisdiction would be that the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction and hence an order might be interpreted to cover any cases which, if contemplated, would have precluded the settlement that created the bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.494" offset="9599415">If Travelers had thought that it was going to be liable for these cases of insurer misconduct, it might very well have said: We're not forking over X hundred millions of dollars, leaving this exposure open.</text>

            <text syncTime="3437.441" offset="13855180">I have five quick points I want to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.526" offset="13863539">First, the Second Circuit upheld the core factual findings that, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.132" offset="13893945">"the instant claims against Travelers arise out of its provision of insurance coverage to Manville. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.386" offset="13922994">close quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.103" offset="13925815">That's from the Second Circuit opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.822" offset="13932711">It's in the appendix at page 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.190" offset="13946190">Second, there is no use of the word 524(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.598" offset="13995823">524(g), about which we haven't spoken enough, clearly and unmistakably reflects Congress's intent to allow channeling injunctions that bar claims against a debtor and those, like insurers, who are directly or indirectly liable for claims against the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.149" offset="14101985">That's 524(g)(4)(A)(ii) and Roman (iii).</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.569" offset="14127689">524(g) expressly provides an asbestos channeling injunction shall be valid and enforceable and may not be revoked or modified by any court except for an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.312" offset="14178680">We cite in our reply brief the fact that a Senate report accompanying an earlier version of the bill clarified that 524(g) is -- quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.501" offset="14219431">"is not meant to give the bankruptcy courts authority which they do not already possess and simply codifies a court 's ability to issue supplemental permanent injunctions which are irrevocable except on appeal. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.594" offset="14275751">There is a final judgment in this case confirming the plan of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.182" offset="14306158">The Second Circuit issued that -- confirmed that judgment twice, once in the MacArthur case and once in the Kane case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.752" offset="14340430">And then in the O'Malley case, which is a 1996 case, the Second Circuit rejected a collateral attack on the confirmation order on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.326" offset="14386719">First, they found that the performance of the futures representative that Judge Lifland had appointed and which was incorporated in 524(g), modeled on the Manville reorganization proceeding -- the Second Circuit found that the legal representative, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.105" offset="14453802">"took an active and aggressive role in protecting future claimants in this litigation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.092" offset="14473759">And, secondly, the Second Circuit rejected the challenge to the continuation of the 1986 order enjoining the suits against the insurers as being without merit because such an injunction was essential to the success of the settlement, and its continuation was well within the court's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.688" offset="14556202">As respects Chubb, Judge Koeltl in affirming Judge Lifland's 2004 order, specifically found that Chubb, a multinational insurer that has paid more than a billion dollars to resolve asbestos-related claims, was clearly on notice of these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.752" offset="14640421">We cite in our reply brief, on pages 10 and 11, several 524(g) injunctions that have run to the benefit of Chubb which contain the exact same</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.140" offset="14769988">"based upon, arising out of, or related to. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.261" offset="14698412">language that appears in the original Manville order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.797" offset="14712623">We didn't cite -- but it's a matter of public record -- that Chubb paid $550 million to resolve through a bankruptcy proceeding in Fibreboard liabilities relating to Fibreboard receiving the same</text>
