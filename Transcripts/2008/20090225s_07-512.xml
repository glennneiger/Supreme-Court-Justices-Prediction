            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="28">I have our opinion this morning in case 07-512, Pacific Bell Telephone versus Linkline Communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.608" offset="30435">This is a case about DSL service.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.142" offset="40570">DSL service is a method of connecting to the internet at high speed over telephone lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.508" offset="65961">The defendants are a group of companies that have gone through corporate reorganizations and name changes while the case was pending but we'll call them AT&amp;T.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.984" offset="103891">The Federal Communications Commission requires AT&amp;T to sell wholesale DSL services to independent firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.045" offset="136178">The plaintiffs in this case are such independent internet service providers and they compete against AT&amp;T in the retail DSL market in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.118" offset="176407">These companies have to release at least telephone lines from AT&amp;T as otherwise they wouldn't be able to provide the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.411" offset="209635">Now, those plaintiffs brought suite under Section 2 of the Sherman Act arguing that AT&amp;T had unlawfully squeezed their profit margins by charging them a high price for wholesale DSL service, and at the same time, setting their own prize too low for the retail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.898" offset="283613">The plaintiffs argued that this maneuver put them at an unfair disadvantage and allowed AT&amp;T to maintain a monopoly over the DSL market.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.461" offset="321857">AT&amp;T moved to dismiss these price squeezed claims, but the District Court denied their motion and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.972" offset="355816">We hold that the plaintiff may not bring a prize squeezed claim when the defendant I under no obligation under the antitrust laws to deal with the plaintiff in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.136" offset="396567">AT&amp;T's obligation to deal rose only because of the FCC regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.885" offset="419555">Now, a price squeeze claim involves a challenge to both the wholesale price and a retial price.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.352" offset="441393">That's where the squeeze comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.896" offset="451528">Our recent decision in the case called Trinko holds that a firm with no deal, no duty to deal under the antitrust laws like AT&amp;T here does not need to deal under the terms and conditions its rivals would prefer, so that takes care of the allegation about the wholesale price.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.345" offset="525403">Now, our decision in the case called Brooke Group takes care of the allegation that AT&amp;T's retail prices were too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.776" offset="555078">Low retail prices are almost always a good thing, so this Court has allowed anti-trust claim saying that prices are too low only when those prices are below cost and meet other strict requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.618" offset="610457">The plaintiffs at this stage of the case do not make any allegations of below price, below cost pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.739" offset="638983">Now, when there is no duty to deal a the wholesale level and now below the low cost pricing at the retail level, a firm is not required to price both its wholesale and retail services in a manner that preserves its rival's profit margins.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.588" offset="706379">AT&amp;T's to rights do not make a wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.160" offset="720590">We're also reluctant to recognize these claims because there's no easy way to define a price squeeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.179" offset="744727">Both businesses and courts need clear rules to operate effectively, but every price squeeze claim would require a complex economic analysis of pricing practices across multiple markets, and we and other courts are just not that good at that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.317" offset="813272">We're likely to get it wrong a lot and everytime we do, the judiciary would be imposing higher prices on consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.422" offset="841693">We're very reluctant to get into that sort of business in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.539" offset="858098">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.793" offset="887146">Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment which Justices Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg have joined.</text>
