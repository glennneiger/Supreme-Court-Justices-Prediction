            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="7.995" offset="136422">A federal statute entitled aggravated identity theft makes it a crime to -- the language support in here, â€œknowingly transfer, posses, or use without lawful authority a means of identification of another person" during or in relation to some other crime and it increases the penalty imposed upon a person who for example uses fraudulent documents in that particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.747" offset="271423">The petitioner, Ignacio Flores-Figueroa gave his employer a false Social Security card and other counterfeit documents that contained his name, but an identification number that belong to another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.895" offset="335997">The question before us is whether the statute requires the Government to prove that Flores-Figueroa knew that the numbers belong to another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.539" offset="378525">And we conclude that it does. To understand why that so, it's necessary to look at the statute, it starts with the word, "knowingly" followed by verb such as "transfer" followed by an object, namely a means of identification of another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.015" offset="452504">In most context, listeners take the use of a simple English sentence constructed in this way to mean that knowingly modifies a verb's object.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.147" offset="497016">If I tell you, John knowingly ate a BLT sandwich, we assume that John knew that what he ate, namely a sandwich contained bacons, lettuce, and tomato.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.831" offset="555739">If I tell you only -- without using the word "knowingly", John sent the bank draft to the capital of Honduras.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.932" offset="588131">You think John may or may not know the name of that capital city.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.600" offset="606835">But if I tell you John knowingly did so, it is more likely that I'm telling you that John also knows the name of the capital of Honduras which happens to be Tegucigalpa which not too many people know.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.031" offset="664513">Now, what is true in life is true in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.150" offset="681023">Ordinarily, we read the word, "knowingly" in a criminal statute as modifying the object that follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.915" offset="708086">At least in the absence of special circumstances and there are no special circumstances here.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.446" offset="734208">To the contrary, the statute imposes its extra punishment not upon counterfeiting or fraud but upon identity theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.255" offset="773392">And it is natural to read such a statute as insisting that the Government show that the defendant knew that he was stealing somebody's identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.649" offset="814979">Thus, we hold that the Government must show that Flores-Figueroa knew that the false means of identification he gave his employer were those of another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.873" offset="863880">For these reasons and others more fully explained in our opinion, we all reverse an Eighth Circuit determination to the contrary and we remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.247" offset="905362">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.381" offset="933888">Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
