            <text syncTime="977.996" offset="4016337">But just to be clear, in addition to being able to just say on the face of the fact about the identification that the government can present circumstantial evidence to the jury, in a great number of cases, particularly the kinds that Congress was most concerned about, the way that they -- the defendant obtained the identification and the way that they used it provides powerful circumstantial evidence of knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.566" offset="4106616">Somebody who breaks into a computer system or unauthorizedly uses access to a computer system or goes dumpster diving looking for IDs obviously knows that they are going to end up with an ID that belongs to another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.576" offset="4154681">And if they use the ID to try to get into a real person's bank account, then it's awfully good information that they were aware that that was an ID that belonged to another person, because there's no sense in trying to break into the bank account of a nonexistent person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.539" offset="4214554">And so we don't think that this is a case in which the government faces some kind of insurmountable burden in proving knowledge in a way that's particularly different than -- than other kinds of situations in which the law commonly requires the government to prove what a defendant knew or didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.000" offset="4280383">To get back to the victim-focused nature of this, you know, Congress could -- we don't dispute that Congress could make a policy judgment that it would be good to hold defendants strictly liable when they used an identification that turns out to belong to somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.508" offset="4358437">Sometimes the law does that, most commonly with respect to sentencing enhancement provisions of the sort that the government points to with respect to drug quantity or selling drugs in a school zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.162" offset="4401068">But when Congress makes that choice, Congress makes that clear in the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.768" offset="4419459">And so if you look at the drug quantity or the school zone provisions, which are in appendix E and D of the -- of the yellow brief appendix, in appendix D you see that Congress establishes in subsection (a) of that provision the "unlawful act", and it says it's unlawful for any person "knowingly to manufacture, distribute", et cetera, a controlled substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.241" offset="4525411">It includes in that provision a knowledge requirement, which, by the way, nobody thinks means only that the government has to show that they knowingly manufactured something which turned out to be a controlled substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.524" offset="4810459">Well, to answer that question -- and then I'd like to return to the school zone example -- the fact that Congress put in "without lawful authority" and enclosed it with commas I think simply reflects that Congress understood that, by inserting that phrase between transitive verbs and the direct object, it was interrupting the natural flow of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.329" offset="4881721">And I don't think it means -- so the first comma may tell the reader to pause, but the second comma I think just as clearly indicates to the reader that the flow of the sentence continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.561" offset="4922681">And so that I don't think you would say a sentence that says, John knowingly used without permission a pair of scissors of his mother's.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.646" offset="4998959">But when Congress intends to write a statute that -- that holds people strictly liable for aggravating circumstances or writes something like the federal quantity provisions where, in subsection (b), Congress sets out the punishment that is deserving because of that aggravating factor, and it does not include a mens rea requirement in subsection (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.967" offset="5088298">And in the school zone provision, Congress likewise has no mens rea requirement with respect to the knowledge of the person being in a school zone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.142" offset="5368957">In fact, by far more -- far more commonly, as the LaFave treatise that we cite to you explains, we don't hold defendants criminally strictly liable for all of the consequences of their crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.598" offset="5478776">Now, Congress could make a different choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.592" offset="5558815">But our point is simply there are reasons why Congress might not do that, including the anomalous kind of penalties that end up being meted out here, where you have people -- two people with identical culpability ending up with substantially different punishments, or people with substantially different culpability ending up with identical punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.317" offset="5641676">If you have the classic aggravated identity thief who breaks into a bank account using a means of identification he knows belongs to somebody else, it's exactly the same sentence, under the government's view, as somebody like Petitioner who just unknowingly used a number in order to get a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.466" offset="5706250">Now, it's not impossible that Congress could make that policy choice, but when it does, it tends to write statutes that look very different than this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.394" offset="6394002">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is common ground that there are at least three preconditions to liability under 18 U.S.C. section 1028A(a)(1): First and foremost, the defendant must commit one of the separate predicate felonies that are specifically enumerated in subsection (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.483" offset="6470280">Second, during the commission of that felony, the defendant must use something that is in fact a means of identification of another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.854" offset="6507792">And, third, that use of the means of identification of another person must itself be without lawful authority and must have the effect of facilitating the defendant's commission of the underlying predicate felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.596" offset="6558783">The question in this case is whether the government must also show that the defendant was specifically aware that the means of identification that he uses to facilitate his underlying crime was that of another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.919" offset="6608102">And the answer to that question is no.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.325" offset="6617715">Mr. Heytens, did the prosecutor give the right answer to Judge Friedman in the district court when Judge Friedman asked: Where I take two people and one of them gets a false Social Security card and it happens that the number belongs to no live person, and another person goes to the same outfit, but the card that he gets does belong to a live person -- he doesn't know in either case -- did the prosecutor give the right answer when he said, when it turns out to be a fictitious number, no two-year add-on; but if it turns out to be a real number, two years' mandatory addition?</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.427" offset="6862117">The prosecutor said, yes, that's the difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.792" offset="6931602">So there are no victimless violations of 1028(a)(1), because if we are having this conversation at all, there was a real victim involved in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.199" offset="7265238">But I don't think that is controlling in this case for a very important reason, and the very important reason -- again, to go back to what I said at the outset -- is we are not having this conversation unless the defendant has already committed a predicate felony, and he is subject to punishment for that predicate felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.363" offset="7325842">For example, in this case, the predicate felony subjected Mr. Flores-Figueroa to a term of up to 10 years of imprisonment, above and beyond the 2 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2217.909" offset="8976050">Your narrowest position is that the "knowingly" simply refers to the -- the -- the three acts which are specified by which the identification can -- can be -- the misidentification can be perpetrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.792" offset="9039579">Transfers, possesses, or uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.977" offset="9052327">Could Congress possibly have said, gee, he might not know that he was acting to transfer or to possess or to use?</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.648" offset="9090988">That's not a serious possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.159" offset="9101019">So, "knowingly" has to refer to something more than the three possible acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.796" offset="9127560">And once you get beyond the three possible acts, and you say, well, we're going to draw the line between "without authority" and "another person" -- that seems like an arbitrary line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.182" offset="9177088">And the arbitrariness of the line seems even more obvious when the "without lawful authority" is set off as a parenthetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.303" offset="9209584">And the real object of the statute -- the real -- the operative description is</text>

            <text syncTime="2285.347" offset="9245738">That's why, it seems to me that, if you look at the text, you could say, well, of course, the "knowingly" has got to refer to everything that follows, both "lawful authority" and "another person".</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.279" offset="9293490">And that's why, it seems to me, if you're going to win, you've got to win on the grounds that Congress wouldn't have meant what seems so natural, because Congress wanted to help victims, not defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2565.511" offset="10366391">And that is because mandatory minimums, given the human condition, inevitably throw some people into the box who shouldn't be there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.095" offset="12296735">You -- you gave earlier the felony murder example of the one who -- the gun goes off, he didn't mean to kill anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.904" offset="12332053">But I thought homicide is -- it's an answer to your argument that this statute is entirely victim-centered, because a person is just as dead if he's the victim of a reckless driver as a premeditated murder, and yet we certainly distinguish the penalties in those cases, no matter that the harm was identical.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.191" offset="12437170">--We certainly do, Justice Ginsburg, and we don't make the extravagant claim that law doesn't look to relative moral culpability in assigning criminal punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.295" offset="12465591">I'm responding to the argument on the other side that that's all the law ever looks to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.246" offset="12481369">The law frequently looks to two different things: It looks to relative culpability levels, but it also looks at the existence of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.119" offset="12504879">If you want to continue with the homicide example, if you look at moral culpability, two people who both intentionally attempt to cause the death of another human being without any legal excuse for doing so, from a culpability standpoint, have engaged in precisely the same level of moral wrong, but law treats attempted murder and completed murder extremely differently from one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.828" offset="12587739">And that's because in one case, as Justice Ginsburg points out, you have a real victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.391" offset="12605921">When the person dies, there is a discrete level of harm to the victim that is not -- that does not occur when, fortunately, the person who tries to kill someone else fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.763" offset="12639462">And I think, at the end of the day, that is the most important issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.558" offset="12654613">You see this argument again and again and again, especially in the circuits -- let me go back to Justice Ginsburg's point about the three circuits that have gone either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.071" offset="12688677">First, as a -- as just a threshold matter, this Court has said repeatedly that the fact that courts have disagreed about the proper interpretation of a statute doesn't suffice to trigger the rule of lenity, because this Court almost never takes a case where there is not a circuit split.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.003" offset="12744370">And if you said the existence of a circuit split makes the statute ambiguous would mean that the criminal defendant wins every time; and the Court has not said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.513" offset="12774463">But -- but also I think where those courts have fundamentally gone wrong is they have essentially said, this is a crime about theft; theft requires you to know that there's a real owner; if you don't know there's a real owner, that's not theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.745" offset="12827335">And I think where they went wrong was at the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.381" offset="12837888">Where they went wrong at the very beginning is asking the question of whether it would be natural to refer to someone like Petitioner as a thief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.849" offset="12863801">We think the more appropriate question, as the district court said in Godin, is whether it would be at all unusual to refer to the two innocent people whose Social Security number and alien registration numbers Petitioner used to facilitate his two underlying felonies were the victims of identity theft.</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.375" offset="13057944">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.376" offset="13065885">I would like to address just a couple of quick questions about the text, and then address a couple of other issues about the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.934" offset="13092112">Justice Breyer, you asked if there were examples of other statutes in which knowledge requirements didn't extend to all the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.744" offset="13119384">The government gave two examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.820" offset="13131713">The first, Morissette, is clearly an example with a jurisdictional element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.835" offset="13143730">All of the circuit courts that say that the knowledge requirement doesn't extend to "of the United States" do so on the grounds that it's because there's a jurisdictional element, and jurisdictional elements don't extend -- don't require mens rea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.608" offset="13190855">With respect to the Chin example, I do acknowledge that there -- there is a decision that this Court hasn't reviewed in which the D.C. Circuit said it doesn't extend to the age of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.181" offset="13237144">That falls within a category of special cases where courts have treated the victimization of children differently, in part because it's so difficult and nearly impossible to prove the defendant's knowledge of the age of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.710" offset="13287194">That kind of practical barrier simply doesn't exist here for all the reasons we've discussed earlier about the government's ability to rely on circumstantial evidence to show the defendant's state of mind here.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3306.345" offset="13329826">There aren't too many 15-year-olds who look like they're over 21?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="3313.719" offset="13359292">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.095" offset="13356784">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.094" offset="13360755">With respect to the victim-focused nature of this, again, it's true that -- that the criminal law takes into account both defendant culpability and harm to victims, but the ordinary resolution is to reserve punishment in the criminal system for those who intend the harms that they inflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.034" offset="13460543">There are, of course, exceptions like felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.218" offset="13469320">As the LaFave treatise points out, that kind of treatment tends to be reserved for serious bodily injury or death kinds of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.062" offset="13496696">And there's no reason to think that Congress thought, although identity theft is serious, that this fell within that kind of category of exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.354" offset="13525849">There are of course these other exceptions where Congress relies on facts not known to the defendant for sentencing enhancement, but as I've mentioned earlier, it tends to write those statutes in a way that makes clear that those enhancement factors are separate and apart from the underlying offense, and they don't include an express mens rea requirement there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.346" offset="13597738">And the government hasn't cited any case, any statute that looks like this, that has been treated as a sentencing enhancement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.657" offset="13626995">Finally, with respect to the rule of lenity, the government I think has acknowledged that the statutory text is at least ambiguous with respect to whether or not it compels their conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.105" offset="13676837">They've acknowledged that you can make policy arguments both ways about what would be a good idea about how to treat this kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.834" offset="13707766">And I think, regardless of your view of what the trigger of the rule of lenity is, this is a classic case for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.363" offset="13737859">If Congress intended the government's interpretation, the government is free to go back to Congress, and there's every reason to believe that Congress would be receptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.313" offset="13773699">The problem with overconstruing a mandatory sentence or a mandatory minimum, as Justice Breyer was alluding to, is that it does have this particularly harsh effect, and one that is, as a practical matter, hard to undo in the legislative process, which as the Court has recognized, is another function served by the rule of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.758" offset="13855410">If the Court has no further questions.</text>
