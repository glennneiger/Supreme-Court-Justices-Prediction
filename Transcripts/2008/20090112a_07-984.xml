            <text syncTime="15.010" offset="165449">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The expert agencies charged by Congress with implementing the Clean Water Act have concluded that the discharge of fill material, like the mine tailings at issue in this case, should be permitted by the Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Act, and are not -- are not subject to the effluent guidelines applicable to permits issued by the EPA under section 402 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.243" offset="278403">That interpretation is grounded on more than 3 decades of agency pronouncements and reflects the collective judgment and expertise of the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA in administering the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="74.798" offset="404626">Either it's going to be permitted under section 402 of the Act, which covers pollutants generally but not the discharge of dredged material, or fill material, which is covered by section 404 of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.864" offset="604829">But it does -- here's the -- here's the problem that I'm -- I'm having and I think others may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.183" offset="622174">We start, number one, with a definition, as I understand it, of "pollutant" that includes suspended solids.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.222" offset="654357">Number two, there is an existing regulation to the effect that wastewater from this particular method of -- of extracting gold shall -- shall simply not be released, shall not be put into -- into water bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.433" offset="727186">And then the two agencies come along, and in effect they say, by regulation, if the suspended solid in effect comes out of a mine, or if the wastewater has got suspended solid in it, we are going to call it fill and leave it entirely to the Army engineers under 404, subject to an EPA veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.484" offset="827392">And on the face of it, it sounds as though they are simply, number one, defining one -- one variant of pollution out of the EPA's jurisdiction and, number two, with respect to the wastewater, in effect coming up with a contradictory determination about what should be done with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.247" offset="918403">And it sounds as though, under the Administrative Procedure Act, that with the statutory and the regulatory regime on the one hand and this joint regulation on the other, you've simply got a flat contradiction, and queried whether that can be anything other than arbitrary and capricious under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.311" offset="994680">Will you address that for--</text>

            <text syncTime="250.645" offset="1108052">So you may say, well, they didn't raise it well enough, but I -- I still want you to deal with it on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.225" offset="1494350">During that period -- you're right -- 404 permits were not -- were not issued for the discharge of things where the purpose was not to fill the lake; it was to dispose of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.151" offset="1546073">Now, during that period, though, those discharges were not regulated under section 402 of the Act and under section 306, the effluent guidelines, but for a different reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.007" offset="1585465">The reason why they weren't regulated under 402 during that period is because of the agencies' wastewater treatment exception, which is found at 40 C.F.R. 122.2, where the agencies excepted from the definition of</text>

            <text syncTime="388.368" offset="1658922">And what you have going on here is the discharge of fill material into an impoundment area, which is dammed off with a 50-foot dam.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.365" offset="3590834">And the prospect of that harm is no basis for this Court to override the statutory scheme that Congress created with two distinct permitting regimes, one for fill material, one for other pollutants, and to override the agencies' pronouncements, interpretations for more than 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.826" offset="3660737">And the other agency document I wanted to point to is very important.</text>
