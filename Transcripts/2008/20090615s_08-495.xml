            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The second case is an immigration case, an immigration that's called Nijhawan v. Holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.047" offset="133580">Immigration law permits the Government to deport an alien who is convicted of “aggravated felony”.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.819" offset="168688">And there is a related statute, there's a whole lot of offenses that it calls aggravated felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.526" offset="187496">It defines them.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.159" offset="194079">And one on that long list is “an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victims exceeds $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.566" offset="243712">The question here is, how does the immigration judge decide, whether a fraud offense of which an alien was previously convicted involved a loss to the victim exceeding $10,000?</text>
            <text syncTime="47.844" offset="296793">Does he just have to look at the fraud statute as it's described in the statute books?</text>
            <text syncTime="53.025" offset="317482">Let's see, for example, maybe there's a monetary threshold there, say, defining the crime as applying only where the loss is greater than $10,000 or $100,000 or greater than a million.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.672" offset="364084">And that threshold is convicted with guarantee that the fraud involved more than $10,000 because it's part of the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.042" offset="401596">Or can the immigration judge also look to the proceedings in the fraud case itself to determine what actually happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="82.821" offset="436705">That matters in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.109" offset="445900">That's because the relevant fraud statute doesn't say anything about amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.348" offset="462827">It doesn't have a threat to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.582" offset="471709">So, if we just read the statute, we can't tell whether the defendant defrauded the victim of $5 or $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.486" offset="507340">But we do know from the record in the particular case that the defendant stipulated its sentencing that the laws from his fraud exceeded a hundred million dollars and the sentencing judge ordered him to pay $683 million in restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.930" offset="573168">We decide that the Immigration Judge can look beyond the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.223" offset="590305">And in this case, we think the Immigration Judge was right to look at the sentencing record.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.085" offset="613710">There are so few fraud crimes defined in the statute books as containing monetary thresholds than to hold otherwise as the defendant wanted us to do would lead the immigration laws fraud provision without any coherent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.574" offset="675673">Moreover, we think there's sufficient safeguards for those threatened with deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.615" offset="695839">In the laws requirement that the Government at the deportation proceeding has to prove by clear and convincing evidence that that earlier fraud conviction did involve a loss of at least $10,000 or more and the Government must tie the laws to a specific count of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.650" offset="768042">We explained all this further in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.382" offset="778909">We affirmed the same conclusion reached by the Third Circuit and this decision is unanimous.</text>
