            <text syncTime="12.474" offset="155314">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns conflict pre-emption under the Supremacy Clause, and the conflict presented here is stark.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.746" offset="196378">Repeatedly over the years, the FDA approved Phenergan injection as safe and effective under all the conditions and methods of use described in the labeling, including what is referred to as IV push&gt; ["] injection.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.423" offset="255101">Yet a State jury, evaluating the same risk that the FDA had considered, determined that the precise labeling that FDA had required Wyeth to use in fact rendered Phenergan "unreasonably dangerous".</text>

            <text syncTime="55.185" offset="326154">Just at the outset, I'll just make one comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.103" offset="337857">You argue that it's impossible for Wyeth to comply with the State law and at the same time the Federal label.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.275" offset="374533">As a textual matter, as a logical matter, I just -- I don't understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.946" offset="397208">I think I could design a label that's completely consistent and that meets the requirements that the Respondents wish to urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.368" offset="434928">Now, if you want to say that any alteration of the label violates Federal law, that's something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.522" offset="455513">But as a textual matter, as a logical matter, as a semantic matter, I don't agree with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.211" offset="494279">I think what you've articulated is the test which is, is it possible for a regulated party to comply at the same time with both Federal law and State law?</text>
            <text syncTime="108.702" offset="540254">In other words, could they use, as they were required by Federal law to do, to use the precise label that in approving the application in 1998 the FDA required Wyeth to use, and also use the label that the Vermont jury determined should be used, and that was stated in the complaint and in the opening and the closing a statement that you may not, should not use IV administration or IV push, in other words that you should contra -- the label should contra-indicate something--</text>

            <text syncTime="153.916" offset="721126">It said IV push is the claim, and that was -- as I understand this, the FDA was aware of the IV use and a certain risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.759" offset="780476">But did it ever, ever discreetly consider IV push versus IV administered the usual way by a drip bag?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="178.365" stopTime="348.001">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="178.365" offset="818928">--Yes it did, Justice Ginsburg, and I want to cite you to the portions of the record that demonstrate that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.434" offset="843170">But before I do so, I just want to underscore a point that I think is clear from both our brief and the Solicitor General's brief, which is that isn't the test of preemption in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.076" offset="889772">The question is what did the labeling say and upon what information was the labeling decision made.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.480" offset="915372">But as to your particular question, there are -- first of all, there was testimony in the record from multiple parties, including experts from both sides, that the FDA was aware of all of the forms of administration and the risk, including IV push.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.894" offset="996979">Their experts simply disagreed with the judgment that the labeling requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.111" offset="1017877">But most saliently, the labeling in this case, which is reproduced, in sort of microscopic size unfortunately, on the last two pages of the petitioner appendix and the last two pages of the joint appendix, have four separate reference that, as we explained in footnote 11 of our reply brief, only apply to IV push.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.559" offset="1119650">There is a reference to the use of the Tubex system.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.428" offset="1135114">That is a direct IV push system.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.665" offset="1148071">There is a reference to rigid plungers and small-bore needles.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.050" offset="1169596">Again nothing to do with drip.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.819" offset="1180672">There is a reference to a maximum rate of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.937" offset="1197181">Drip is gravity.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.723" offset="1204287">The testimony in the case was that an instruction that a particular rate of administration not be exceeded only referred to IV push.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.531" offset="1251516">And finally, there are cautions on the label about how the ordinary aspiration of blood to see if its bright or dark, which is only done in the context of a needle that is being used to push something into a vein, is not reliable in the context of this case because Phenergan discolors arterial blood immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.431" offset="1359141">So the labeling plainly comprehended and warned about the specific risks of IV push administration, and that's not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.553" offset="1399683">There is an advisory -- an advisory committee in 1976 was asked to look at precisely the risk of arterial exposure to Phenergan injection or any other irritant drug that is administered intravenously and it made specific recommendations, including recommendations that go directly to IV push.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.001" offset="1497381">How could the -- how could the FDA concluded that IV push was safe and effective when on the benefit side of this you don't have a life-saving drug, you have a drug that relieves nausea, and on the risk side you have the risk of gangrene?</text>

            <text syncTime="365.130" offset="1565926">I mean, there was testimony -- Justice Alito, I can go over the testimony, but there is -- there was testimony in this very case about those very circumstances in which direct IV injection is indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.639" offset="1624022">And there is also test -- there is also evidence in the FDA record, including if you look at the 1987 correspondence that the FDA sent to Wyeth in the context of talking about what warnings had to be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.649" offset="1687970">The FDA provided Wyeth 20 citations to 20 medical journals that addressed this problem, and in footnote 13 of our reply brief we've cited the ones that specifically address the circumstances in which IV push administration is an important tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.745" offset="1772398">The point here is, I think, that--</text>

            <text syncTime="459.924" offset="1945119">--The FDA -- well, the FDA certainly is.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.293" offset="1958599">And the issue, Justice Kennedy, here is the FDA has to decide what information to provide to clinicians so that they can make judgments about what to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.351" offset="2006873">And it -- what it did here is it provided ample, lavish warnings about the risk of intra-arterial injection and exposure of an irritant drug like Phenergan to arterial blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.377" offset="2070925">It provided in the labeling to the physicians a cascading hierarchy of methods of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.299" offset="2102585">It said intramuscular injection is the preferred method.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.203" offset="2126200">It then said with respect to intravenous injection that it is, as with any irritant drug, it is usually preferable to inject it into an IV infusion set that is known to be running properly, in other words where a line has already been established into the vein and the IV push occurs into the line that's already established.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.604" offset="2231839">All that information was available to physicians and the FDA has to understand and does understand that in labeling to allow medical professionals to make their judgments, taking options away from physicians is not always better.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.017" offset="2309475">It may not -- it may not even often be better.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.886" offset="2320969">What the FDA has to decide in terms of telling physicians what's on the table and what's off the table and in terms of what's on the table what the relevant risks are is, is this ever -- would this ever be medically warranted?</text>
            <text syncTime="570.146" offset="2385962">The testimony in this case and in the administrative record was yes, there are circumstances--</text>

            <text syncTime="575.216" offset="2406233">I'd like you to address the distinction between the medical device area and the drug area because in the medical device area, of course, you have an express pre-emption clause, while here in contrast you don't.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.607" offset="2459836">I mean, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you've identified the respect in which this is different than the medical device area.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.677" offset="2488153">But for the salient purposes, I think the Riegel case directly points the Court to the nature of the determination that the FDA makes with respect to class 3 drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.069" offset="2537681">It goes through the same preclearance process.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.537" offset="2547608">As we pointed out in our brief and as I think Justice Scalia's opinion in Riegel points out, the balancing time-intensive, data-intensive inquiry for medical devices was patterned after what is done for drugs, and it reflects a balancing of risks and benefits of the particular drug in light of the conditions and methods of administration prescribed in the labeling.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.873" offset="2664950">If that's true you would have expected the Federal Drug Act to have a similar express pre-emption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.027" offset="2685534">And one reason perhaps that it didn't is that when the Drug Act was passed you had an established background of State actions; when the Medical Device Act was passed you didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.133" offset="2725972">Well, let me address both the established background of State actions and then the pre-emption clause difference, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.505" offset="2763483">The Respondent and her amici have identified 97 cases going back 150 years in which tort actions have been brought with respect to pharmaceuticals.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.313" offset="2810713">Very few of those cases -- and they are recent -- are implicated by the rule that the Vermont Supreme Court applied in this case, which is where a fully informed FDA, informed of all the information that Wyeth had, approved a labeling standard, but a court looking at the same evidence can reach a different conclusion about what is on the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.344" offset="2914785">The most -- those cases I believe all post-date Cipollone.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.832" offset="2932757">Many of them postdate Geier.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.534" offset="2943519">And by my count, there are fewer than 20 such cases out of all of the cases that have been decided and those issues -- that issue had never come up and never could have come up when Congress enacted the 1938 Act, because it was only the 1938 Act that established a drug-specific, preclearance regime, and really in 1962, in which the FDA was required not just to evaluate safety in terms of licensing the distribution of the drug, but to balance safety against effectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.159" offset="3098060">And so the -- the constellation of common law cases -- I mean, let me just say we are -- we are not seeking here a rule of field preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.181" offset="3138184">We are not seeking to preclude tort remedies for conduct that violates Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.419" offset="3163052">What we are saying here is -- and this goes, I think, finally to your point about the express pre-emption clause -- the presence of expressed pre-emption clauses or the absence, the presence of a savings clause or the absence, does not and cannot affect the operation of conflict pre-emption under the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.034" offset="3253541">Now, members of this Court are concerned about applying a broad, vague, or free-wheeling analysis of implied conflict pre-emption, but this case is heartland.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.508" offset="3303487">A jury was asked to look at the same information and conclude that the precise language that the FDA just didn't allow, the FDA required Wyeth to use, rendered that drug unreasonably unsafe.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.921" offset="3389064">But as -- excuse me -- as I understand it, the -- the company, Wyeth, could have gone back to the FDA at any time and said, either based on experience or just our rethinking of the data that we have, we think the label ought to be changed to say IV push&gt; ["].</text>
            <text syncTime="843.537" offset="3479552">Wyeth could have done that at any time, and it simply didn't do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3501.051" offset="14109612">One is misbranding, which is the original 1906 reactive penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.271" offset="14134481">If the FDA subsequently finds that something is false or misleading, it CAN come after you for misbranding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.842" offset="14160812">But this case involves the criminal prohibition against distributing drugs for which there is not an approved, effective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.233" offset="14198324">And that's what's at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.816" offset="14204698">Now, the notion that there was any -- any misunderstanding in the trial court about whether there was new information or whether there was -- there were incidents that the FDA didn't know about, or it didn't evaluate the risk, is just flat wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.444" offset="14271154">The plaintiff tried this -- the plaintiff's experts said the FDA knew about this risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.598" offset="14295813">Wyeth knew about this risk for decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.848" offset="14304799">That is what is so wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.300" offset="14310651">That is why he stood up and said the FDA doesn't decide this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.370" offset="14330922">You decide this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.054" offset="14337609">And there was never, ever a suggestion in the record in this case, nor could there have been, that Wyeth ever failed to bring every single adverse-event report to the FDA's attention, every analysis that it did to the FDA's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.749" offset="14404378">And what the record does show is that after -- between the time of the 1955 approval of the new-drug application and the 1998 rejection of the SDNA, the Supplemental New -- SNDA, the Supplemental New Drug Application, that did have more extensive, stronger warnings in this case, Wyeth filed five -- and these are all in the joint appendix -- five supplemental, new-drug applications, each one asking for more language, more warnings, about direct IV injection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.457" offset="14559232">It's not called "push".</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.791" offset="14564561">It's IV injection versus drip, which is a gravity method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.243" offset="14582429">And, in fact, Mr. Frederick says: Well, you know, in this case there could have been stronger warnings, and that -- and this case wasn't really about -- the jury wasn't really asked to -- it didn't really say that the label had to contra indicate something that the FDA labeling required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.406" offset="14667065">That is exactly the opposite of what the trial lawyer told the jury at opening and at closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.512" offset="14695487">What he said is this was unreasonably unsafe because it didn't say: Do not use by intravenous administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.701" offset="14732267">With respect to whether or not the warning -- the last SNDA which we submitted, which was in 1987 and is reprinted in the joint appendix -- not only is it an original, but there is a typewritten version that actually has the text in the type size that one can actually read.</text>

            <text syncTime="3712.084" offset="14953785">"In 1988, Wyeth drafted changes to the warning which advised that the use of a free-flowing IV would ensure adequate dilution and reduce the risk of arterial injectia. "</text>
