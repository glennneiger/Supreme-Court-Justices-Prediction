            <text syncTime="8.237" offset="138386">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is about a logical reading of the statute's plain language, and section 3599(a)( 2) that's printed on page 1 of the blue brief provides that when a State death row inmate seeks 2254 relief, he shall be represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.185" offset="226158">He shall be appointed counsel by the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="235980">And that representation is governed by subsection (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="37.189" offset="254161">Subsection (e) that is on page 2a of our blue brief defines the scope of counsel's representation and also divides that representation by two clauses that begin with the word "shall".</text>
            <text syncTime="52.099" offset="313825">This case is controlled by the second (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="60.721" offset="348306">And that clause says that counsel shall also represent the defendant in proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.910" offset="389057">And we know that this means State clemency proceedings because of the words "available" and the words "or other".</text>
            <text syncTime="78.249" offset="418419">For a 2254 petitioner or defendant like Mr. Harbison, the only type of clemency that is available to him is State clemency, and in order to give effect to the words "or other" that were used by Congress, we know that that must refer to State clemency because the only type of clemency that the Federal Government provides is executive clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.781" offset="512564">Now, not only is the interpretation of this statute controlled by the plain language, but this interpretation makes sense because -- and it makes sense that Congress would provide for continuous representation for capital defendants in that it fills a need, a gap in representation; it's efficient; and it also helps to improve the reliability of the death penalty as it's administered in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.136" offset="12037998">We see another instance in which there is a -- an impact on the Federal-State balance, which is the fact that -- that if, on Petitioner's reading, the attorney must return -- must go to State court or go into State proceedings and continue the representation there, they still answer to the Federal judge, who supervises their appointment, supervises their qualifications, and determines whether and to what extent they will be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.169" offset="12130053">And of critical importance, the Federal judge determines when the attorney will be permitted to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.823" offset="12152728">And the Federal judge may not permit such a withdrawal, unless and until the Federal judge can find another attorney who meets the same qualifications for the Federal appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.894" offset="12185015">So you would have, on Petitioner's reading, an attorney appointed by a Federal court who would go into State judicial proceedings and would be unable to ask the State tribunal before whom he or she was appearing for permission to withdraw from the engagement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.355" offset="12590853">I don't think that works in this case to cabin the necessary implications of Petitioner's reading, because the three categories of proceedings are judicial proceedings, competency proceedings, and proceedings for executive or other clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.698" offset="12644248">And each of the examples, from pretrial proceedings down through applications for stays of execution and other appropriate motions and procedures, fall into the category of judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.320" offset="12686670">It's our position that those are to be Federal proceedings, not proceedings in State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.835" offset="12784786">And many of the filings that a habeas counsel might wish to make in State court, if the Petitioner's reading were adopted, would fall under the category of available post-conviction process, a successive writ of habeas corpus or a writ of coram nobis, such as the -- the one that Petitioner litigated in the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals while its Federal habeas proceeding was pending.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.720" offset="12996274">But as a -- as a general answer to your question, the statute does not make clear that if Petitioner can obtain counsel at no cost to himself, that he's no longer eligible for Federal counsel under this provision, because he, after all, would still be indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.479" offset="13055310">And I think the situation that occurred here in the Tennessee courts highlights the -- the difficulty that would be raised by creating a -- by permitting funding for State proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.204" offset="13098256">The Tennessee post-conviction defender is authorized by statute to represent inmates under a sentence of death in post-conviction and clemency proceedings in State court, and he has discretion over the clemency portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.428" offset="13151128">The post-conviction defender in this case declined to use his -- to use his resources to represent Petitioner in the clemency proceedings, because he -- he determined that he didn't have the resources and he was focusing on other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.169" offset="13202119">So, at least as a matter of Tennessee law, that that option was available to him, but it's not been suggested that he is not himself financially unable to obtain counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.579" offset="13255722">So, in -- in any instance like that in which there is -- there are, in some circumstances, State-funded counsel available, I think you would set -- you would create a powerful incentive for the State to say it wishes to go second, that allowed the Federal -- allow Federal funding to come first and State funding to come second, and for the Federal Government to respond in like measure.</text>
