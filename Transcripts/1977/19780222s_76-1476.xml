            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80004">In the other case J.W. Bateson Co., is from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the question in that case is whether a firm that is technically a sub-contractor, can be considered a sub-contractor for purposes of recovery by its employees under a Miller Act payment bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.005" offset="180001">Petitioners had a construction contract with the United States government and  pasted a payment bond as required by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.158" offset="216572">Petitioner sub-contracted part of the work to a firm known as Pierce Associates which in turn sub-contracted a part  with Colquitt Sprinkler Co..</text>
            <text syncTime="46.246" offset="264951">When Colquitt defaulted on certain of its obligations to its employees and their union, the union filed against petitioner under the Miller Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.817" offset="303194">The District Court granted summary judgment for respondents and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.230" offset="328899">By an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.696" offset="350737">The statutory language in the legislative history make clear that Congress meant the term sub-contractor as used in the act to include only those who had a contract with the prime contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.720" offset="414789">Colquitt could have confessed - could have claimed against the bond appears defaulted the employees of Colquitt were not similarly protected, because they did not have a contractual relationship with Pierce or any other sub-contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.686" offset="486678">Virtually, all reported decisions to consider this question had concluded as we do at those who contracted with a sub-contractor are not protected by the Miller Act payment bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.199" offset="540700">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion, to which Mr. Justice Brennan joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.276" offset="561075">Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
