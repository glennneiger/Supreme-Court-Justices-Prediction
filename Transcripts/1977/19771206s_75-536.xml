            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="10.990" offset="123873">This case comes to us on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which held that petitioner Nashville Gas Company's employment policies relating to pregnant employee's violated Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.537" offset="210077">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we have concluded that those policies insofar as they relate to a form -- requiring for taking of a formal leave of absence by such employees do -- in seniority policy do violate Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.079" offset="292206">We conclude that petitioner's sick leave policy is legally indistinguishable from the disability insurance program upheld in Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.466" offset="329822">We, however, remand this to that aspect of the case to the Court of Appeals to determine whether the respondent, the original plaintiff had preserved the right to proceed further on a theory that the petitioner's sick leave policy is a mere pretext for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.846" offset="399308">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is, therefore, affirmed and part vacated in part and remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.481" offset="433894">Mr. Justice Powell joined by Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall has filed an opinion concurring in the part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.006" offset="471928">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
