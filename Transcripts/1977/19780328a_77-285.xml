            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="37.093" offset="228255">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.374" offset="241421">The issue before the Court today is whether Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 requires the Secretary of the Interior to comply with state regulatory water laws when he acquires and uses water under that particular Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.267" offset="304951">Section 8 embodies a fundamental historical principle of the federal reclamation laws, a principle that within some yet undefined limits the states have some measure of control over the use in the distribution of such water.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.492" offset="361897">Thus, the principle in this case is one of ultimate historic significance, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.001" offset="379974">It is whether that substantive principle of the federal reclamation laws will remain a viable principle of those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.115" offset="412366">During my argument this afternoon, I intend to focus on what we consider to be the three major issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.809" offset="439220">First, did Congress in fact, in 1902, establish a principle of state control of water, did Congress actually give that power to the states?</text>
            <text syncTime="99.917" offset="479553">Secondly, if it did, how do we reconcile that principle with the many substantive Congressional policies that Congress has enacted in the field of reclamation, both in the 1902 Act and in later Acts?</text>
            <text syncTime="113.139" offset="532529">In other words, how do we reconcile potential conflicts between state and federal policies?</text>
            <text syncTime="119.912" offset="559592">Third, how do we reconcile the principle of state control with the broad discretion which Congress has given to the Secretary of the Interior to carry out the substantive Congressional policies?</text>
            <text syncTime="132.309" offset="609120">Now, let me turn to the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.007" offset="615912">The Reclamation Act of 1902 essentially provides for federal construction and operation of reclamation facilities in about 17 western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.478" offset="653842">Under the authority of that Act, Congress has authorized a number of reclamation facilities in California that are collectively known as the Central Valley Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.896" offset="691563">The Bureau of Reclamation has always complied with California regulatory water laws in acquiring its water rights for the Central Valley Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.216" offset="724791">It has always submitted permit applications to the California Resources Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.613" offset="746420">The Board has always granted permits to the Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.689" offset="758645">The Board has usually imposed conditions in those permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.821" offset="775259">The Bureau has always complied with the conditions in the permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.259" offset="792918">In fact, since 1927 the State Board had issued 12 major decisions that result in the issuance of conditional permits to the Bureau of Reclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.044" offset="836072">Then, in 1973, the United States filed its present action for declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.506" offset="857911">In this action, it asked the court to determine that the Bureau of Reclamation need not comply with California’s appropriation procedure and, thus, that it need not comply with conditions in the permits which have been issued to the Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.090" offset="912245">The affect of this position, of course, would be to void the conditions in all 12 decisions which have been issued by the State Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.816" offset="943174">A way of illustration, the United States in its complaint referred to a specific decision called Decision 1422.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.905" offset="975566">This decision results in the issuance of conditional permits to the Bureau of Reclamation for the New Melones Project on Stanislaus River in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.697" offset="1014750">The New Melones Project is a dam and reservoir facility that was authorized by Congress in 1944 and it was reauthorized in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.052" offset="1060098">In its complaint, the United States argues that the State Board lacks power under and any and all circumstances to impose any kind of condition upon the federal water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.825" offset="1099282">In California, by way of contrast, argues that California has a qualified power to impose conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.264" offset="1124986">It argues that it can impose conditions if those conditions do not impair or interfere with the basic Congressionally authorized purposes of federal reclamation projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.219" offset="1168768">The lower court upheld the position of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.112" offset="1180366">It held that the State Board is without power to impose conditions under any and all circumstances, that there is not circumstance where such a condition can be imposed upon an appropriate permit issued to the Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.144" offset="1224461">On that basis, the court granted summary judgment for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.400" offset="1241493">The court did not reach the question whether the conditions of Decision 1422 or for that matter any other decision issued by the State Board, in fact, conflict with any Congressionally authorized purposes of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.119" offset="1292379">It avoided that question because it held the question was simply not relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.899" offset="1311501">Was the phrase “Congressional authorized purpose of the project” one gotten out of the legal literature or used by the State of California or by the United States?</text>

            <text syncTime="326.477" offset="1385793">We have maintained throughout this litigation that the state has the power to impose conditions under Section 8 of the Reclamation Act, which I will momentarily describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.552" offset="1422155">We also will point out momentarily that Congress has, subsequent to 1902, adapted a number of reclamation policies and established the individual reclamation projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.207" offset="1464787">In our view, every time Congress establishes such a policy or authorizes such a project, it subtracts from the authority which it originally gave the states in 1902.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.607" offset="1506374">Well, what if Congress said “we want to have the New Melones Project and we are going to appropriate all vested water rights in the State of California that are inconsistent with the operation of that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="370.653" offset="1562590">Would you think Congress could do that if it simply set it forth in the Authorization Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="577.587" offset="2390253">The Court has usually held that the commerce clause and the navigational servitude are essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.444" offset="2413659">In its 1899 decision in Rio Grande, it seem to suggest that there might be a commerce clause power to take water as part of the navigational servitude, but I do not think this Court has ever held that where navigation is not concerned, Congress has powers under the commerce clause to take unappropriated water.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.306" offset="2481160">I hate, of course, to be defending the position of the United States in this litigation at this point, but essentially, what we are really talking about in this case is whether Congress in fact required the Bureau of Reclamation to comply with state law in acquiring unappropriated water.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.532" offset="2546048">The issue in the case is precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.884" offset="2555452">Did Congress in Section 8, provide that the Bureau of Reclamation must comply with state water laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="627.755" offset="2590978">If the State Board lacks a qualified power to impose any kind of conditions on the federal water right, then the conditions of all 12 decisions, which the State Board has issued, including the Decision 1422, would be void.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.141" offset="2644477">If, on the other hand, the State Board has that power, then the conditions of all 12 decisions, we think, are beyond collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.966" offset="2675824">In fact, for the reason that United States has never chosen to seek direct judicial review of any of those decisions and in any event, surely, the Court cannot examine the conditions of any particular decision in this case because that matter was not before the lower court and the lower court did not take any evidence on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.860" offset="2751370">This brings me to what I consider to be a first major question before the Court and that is whether Congress, in fact in 1902, established the principle that the states have the right to control water from the Federal Reclamation Projects under the 1902 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.384" offset="2809466">Section 8 specifically provides that the Secretary shall “proceed in conformity with state laws relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="775.383" offset="3181450">Correct, the Court has never held that United States owns the unappropriated water of the western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.575" offset="3202244">It has held, however, that the United States might have some overriding constitutional powers that enable it to act and establish a certain degree of control over those waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.320" offset="3245189">But it has not actually established that United States has the power to actually own the water itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.422" offset="3273610">Let me turn now to the language of Section 8 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.845" offset="3283328">The Section, on its face, requires the Secretary to proceed in conformity with state laws relating to the control, appropriation, use, and distribution of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.587" offset="3318332">On its face, this Section clearly requires federal compliance with state appropriation laws. State appropriation laws, in turn, provide for state regulatory control of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.309" offset="3357202">This is the way the states control the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.328" offset="3365248">They control the water through their appropriation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.212" offset="3376742">They determine the beneficial use of their water.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.553" offset="3386146">They thus manage and control their limited water supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.822" offset="3399207">Thus, the Section on its face, requires the federal government to be treated as a private appropriator under the state’s appropriation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.467" offset="3429822">Essentially, the United States makes two arguments with respect to the meaning of Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.612" offset="3446332">First, it argues that the Section does not require the Secretary of the Interior to comply with state laws relating to unappropriated water, but that the Secretary merely does so as a matter of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.606" offset="3498368">He does not have to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.375" offset="3501398">He simply does it because he chooses to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.131" offset="3512474">Secondly, the United States argues that if Section 8 actually requires him to comply with state laws, it requires him only to comply with the so-called forms of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.767" offset="3555001">The forms of state law are defined by the United States as consisting of all state laws other than those that provide for regulatory control of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.225" offset="3592826">This conclusion, we think, is wholly inconsistent with the language of Section 8 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.152" offset="3612575">The language says that the Secretary shall proceed, not may proceed or could proceed or should proceed, but shall proceed in conformity with state law and, thus, suggest that he does not do so as a matter of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.622" offset="3666387">Secondly, the Section specifically refers to state laws relating to the control of the use and the distribution of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.093" offset="3700346">Those are the words in the Section itself, control, use, and distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.067" offset="3720200">These are terms, obviously, that include state regulatory control.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.093" offset="3740262">The result which we suggest is even more clear we think, under the legislative history of the Reclamation Act of 1902 and with the Court’s indulgence, I would like to just briefly make reference to a couple of selected portions of the legislative history that we think shows the overwhelming sentiment of the 1902 Congress for the principle of state control.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.028" offset="3820092">If the Court would, I would like to refer to our brief in the case which is the blue brief, the brief for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.245" offset="3844960">You turn first, if you would, to page 25 and just listen to the language of Congressman Mondell of Wyoming who is the floor leader for Section 8 and in fact, the entire reclamation bill when it was before the House of Representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.123" offset="3904415">That is the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.790" offset="3915073">Upon halfway down in the italicized portion of the brief, Congressman Mondell states, “the Secretary of the Interior would proceed to make the appropriation of the necessary water by giving the notice and complying with the forms of the law, of the state, or territory in which the works are located.”</text>
            <text syncTime="975.759" offset="3982991">The United States essentially concedes that that language is not consistent with its comity argument, but it makes the argument that this language is consistent with its so-called form argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.478" offset="4025832">Without arguing that point, without arguing whether Congressman Mondell actually meant to suggest a distinction between the forms and the substance of state law, it is very clear from other portions of the legislative history that no such distinction was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.839" offset="4079331">For instance refer, if the Court would, to page of 27 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.499" offset="4097930">Again, Congressman Mondell speaking, this is the quote that appears near the top of the page, “Section 8 follows the well-established principle and national legislation of recognizing local and state laws relative to the appropriation and distribution of water and instructs the Secretary of the Interior in carrying out the provisions of the Act to conform to these laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.637" offset="4186433">Back on page 24, the floor leader for the bill in the senate, Senator Clark of Wyoming stated, this quotation appears halfway down the page, “it is right that in the general government should control, should conserve, and should reservoir the headwaters of these streams, in this it is a national and not a state proposition, but in the distribution of these waters, it is right and proper that the various states and territories should control in the distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.801" offset="4735109">I think in 1902 Congress was just getting this program off the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.256" offset="4749006">They felt that the best way to proceed would be to proceed by having the Secretary of the Interior comply with state law because the states had always controlled their unappropriated waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.626" offset="4786413">In fact, this Court had recognized the tradition a number of times, that the states traditionally control their unappropriated waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.014" offset="4819955">The same tradition was recognized by Congress back in the Mining Acts of 1866 and the Dessert Land Act of 1877.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.994" offset="4851928">The states essentially have traditionally controlled their unappropriated waters and Congress in 1902, quite evidently, wanted to continue and extend that tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.323" offset="4901248">An examination of the administrative practice, that occurred after the 1902 Act was passed, shows, I think quite convincingly, that Congress was actually successful in its effort to provide for state control of water because the Secretary of the Interior has, in fact, consistently and fully complied with state regulatory water laws in acquiring and using his water under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.630" offset="4986407">For instance, in California, the Bureau of Reclamation has always acquired appropriative permits from California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.361" offset="5013365">California has traditionally imposed the conditions in those permits and the Bureau has always complied with those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.253" offset="5036980">Until this case, it never sought to destroy those conditions, but in this case, the United States is advancing the argument that the Secretary only complied with those state laws as a matter of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.449" offset="5085777">We think that that is entirely inconsistent with everything that the Secretary of the Interior has said ever since 1902 onward with respect to his obligation under Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.361" offset="5125378">In fact, even the current operating regulations of the Secretary of the Interior embrace the principle of state control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.635" offset="5154426">Let me just read from these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.368" offset="5157352">These appear at page 39 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.542" offset="5190057">These are the current regulations of the Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.887" offset="5199462">“The Reclamation Act recognizes the interests and rights of the states in the utilization and control of their water resources and requires the Bureau in carrying out provisions of the Act to proceed in conformity with state water laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.160" offset="5256617">Since the construction of a reservoir and the subsequent storage and release of water for beneficial purposes normally entail stream regulation, it is necessary to reach an understanding with the states regarding reservoir operating limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.325" offset="5309280">Thus, the Secretary has always complied with state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.845" offset="5319311">He has always said that he is required to do so under Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.790" offset="5331119">In this case, the United States was essentially trying to change the rules of the game, 76 years as it were after the game was started, it is essentially trying to break and destroy the historic relationship that has guided --</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.164" offset="5592552">Obviously, since 1902, Congress has established a number of substantives of reclamation policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.616" offset="5618361">It has established and enacted, in fact, four different Acts that essentially amend the Reclamation Act of 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.432" offset="5645633">On top of that, it authorizes individual reclamation projects that have basic Congressional policies behind them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.288" offset="5673114">Some experts in the field of water law and especially some advocates of the state’s rights position have argued that Section 8 literally imposes no limits on state control, and therefore, none should be implied, thus, under that view the states would have the right to override substantive Congressional policies and have the right to exercise a veto power over the projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.093" offset="5752317">The difficulty with that view, of course, is what you are suggesting, Justice Marshall, and that is that the states could, under those circumstances, completely obliterate the Congressional objectives that led to the enactment of the Federal Reclamation Program in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.609" offset="6050322">That might be a very good policy argument, but it is simply inconsistent with what Congress did in 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.939" offset="6071638">It is inconsistent with Section 8 and the principle of state control that is embodied in Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.734" offset="6098910">Thus, our view is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.499" offset="6109881">We think that these various principles can be harmonized and reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.173" offset="6124614">We think that the principle of state control should apply only to the extent that it is consistent with what Congress has actually intended to accomplish in the field of Reclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.597" offset="6162335">In other words, where there is a clash or conflict between Congressional policy and state policy, then obviously, Congressional policy overrides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.599" offset="6194309">On the other hand, if there is no such conflict, then state law applies and that is to say that the states cannot override what Congress has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.902" offset="6235582">By the same token, the Secretary of the Interior cannot override what the states have done if the states have acted consistently with basic Congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.555" offset="6282185">In other words, a federal bureaucrat in Sacramento cannot decide to sell water to an irrigation district on the north side of the Sacramento River rather than the south side, and then claim that his decision represents Congressional policy and then claim that because his decision represents Congressional policy, his decision overrides state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.751" offset="6366926">Because, if the Secretary has that power and state law has no room in the federal reclamation scheme and under those circumstances, the principle of state control on Section 8 which had been honored for 76 years simply does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.782" offset="6427112">In fact, this I think was the approach which this Court took in two cases, in the 1950s and the 1960s in the Ivanhoe and the Fresno cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.931" offset="6467654">In Ivanhoe, state law conflicted with the basic Congressional policy that provides for an acreage limitation and that is found in Section 5 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 and the Court said state law does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.535" offset="6526064">It cannot conflict with the specific Congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.905" offset="6539543">In Fresno, state law conflicted with the specific principle of the federal reclamation laws found in the 1939 Act that provides a preference for water for irrigation purposes over municipal purposes and the Court, again said state law cannot apply under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1884.320" offset="7617251">The conflict in this case is not between Congress and the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.173" offset="7636582">It is between the State of California and the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.708" offset="7650792">The Secretary of the Interior is essentially trying to proceed with a number of plans in California that have no mandate under Congressional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.643" offset="7686528">He is trying to proceed with plans that were not considered or mandated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.998" offset="7703873">Thus, we feel what we are doing is quite consistent with what Congress had in mind in the field of reclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.956" offset="7723726">Thus, there is no clash ultimately in this case between federal and state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.145" offset="7744520">That brings me, I think, to the third major question which I would like to address and that is how we actually resolve the principles we have been talking about with the broad grant of discretion which has been given to the Secretary of the Interior by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.435" offset="7793630">The United States’ argument essentially is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.046" offset="7804079">It argues that Congress has established a very broad comprehensive reclamation scheme and has vested the Secretary of Interior with broad discretion to carry out that scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.919" offset="7843576">This scheme is so broad, according to the United States, that it leaves no room for state control at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.735" offset="7862906">The Secretary of the Interior has discretion to override state water laws whenever he chooses to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.461" offset="7885790">Thus, the United States is really posing perhaps the ultimate issue in this case and let me phrase it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.640" offset="7906479">Has Congress in fact enacted a comprehensive reclamation scheme that in fact leaves no room for state regulatory control or instead does the comprehensive scheme established by Congress include state regulatory laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.754" offset="7970949">To phrase the proposition differently, does the Secretary have a plenary discretionary authority to override state law whenever he wants to do so or instead does Section 8 limit his discretion by requiring him to comply with state law where there is no basic conflict between state law and Congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.343" offset="8057257">I hope the Court has no illusions with respect to the effect of the argument being advanced by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.485" offset="8077842">If that argument is upheld, then Section 8 will have no practical effect because the entire principle of state control will be subservient to the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior and thus will not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.643" offset="8746472">Our view would be that under those circumstances, the Secretary’s discretion is still limited by Section 8 in that if he can comply with state law without violating a specific Congressional mandate, he must do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.561" offset="8798195">If the result is otherwise then Section 8 just does not mean anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.938" offset="8811674">The reason I say that is because the Secretary has broad discretion under the various federal reclamation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.735" offset="8834871">Congress has given him discretion to sell water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.359" offset="8845320">Congress has given him discretion to get money from people who purchase the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.505" offset="8869979">If that discretion in simply selling the water is deemed to override state laws that might otherwise condition to sell that water, then Section 8 is nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.836" offset="8907282">It simply does not exist and Congress has constantly reaffirmed the principle of state control, and therefore, we do not believe that it meant to, thus, repeal Section 8 by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.945" offset="8947720">That is what the United States is really arguing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.471" offset="8957855">It is arguing that Section 8 has been repealed by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.867" offset="8971439">In our view, the Section mandates the partnership between Congress and the states and under that partnership, it is Congress and not the states which set the basic reclamation policies of this country, but within that framework, the states are free to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.942" offset="9035700">The Secretary does not have discretionary authority to destroy that partnership by coming in and overriding a state law that maybe fully within that Congressional parameter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.061" offset="9080213">The result which we are suggesting to the Court is one we think harmonizes and reconciles the various reclamation laws that have been established by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2483.017" offset="10011948">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.560" offset="10026159">I do not think that is the case, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.922" offset="10035667">I do not agree with Mr. Walston that if the Court holds for the United States in this case that means that the United States sweeps the field and that the states are completely excluded from any role in the planning of reclamation projects or in the formulation of reclamation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.931" offset="10139635">On the contrary, we submit that there is and always has been a coordination and a consultation between the states and the federal government and that that is illustrated by this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.097" offset="10196268">Indeed, there are aspects of this case which demonstrate that what the State of California was trying to do here is to upset and override at least one accommodation that had been reached with respect to the New Melones Project and if you will, I will get to that in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.210" offset="10264813">I am referring to the water quality agreement which was an actual memorandum of agreement made between the United States Bureau of Reclamation and the California Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board with respect to water quality functions of the New Melones Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.640" offset="10342449">What the State Board has done in Decision 1422, as I will elaborate in more detail perhaps later, is they simply override that agreement, unilaterally rewrite it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.243" offset="10392918">Thus, we would submit that what the state is trying to do here is to change the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.461" offset="10417786">It is the state and not the federal government which is trying to change the rules that have existed for the past 70-add years and that have an honor to a rough accommodation of the conflicting state and federal interest in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.584" offset="10486227">It is the United States’ submission, of course, that all four of the judges who ruled on this case in the courts below were correct that Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 does not authorize a state to impose conditions on a federal reclamation project such as the 25 conditions that were imposed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.836" offset="10595315">On the point on which the two courts below differed, we do not here challenge the ruling of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.357" offset="10629378">That is that the Court of Appeals ruled that the United States is required by Section 8 to file applications with the State Board for permits to appropriate the water it needs for it reclamation projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.580" offset="10694266">We had contended, as Mr. Walston said in the district court, that we are not by law to do that, that we simply do it as a matter of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.810" offset="10739197">We have, in either event, always done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.296" offset="10753094">The Court of Appeals ruled that we are required by law to do it and as we state in our brief, we do not contest that ruling here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2724.767" offset="10979001">Mr. Walston has said little, indeed nothing in his argument and little in his briefs, about the 25 conditions that were imposed here by the State Board on the New Melones Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.444" offset="11045666">We feel it necessary to look with some detail at those conditions because, as Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, it may seem fine in the abstract to argue as Mr. Walston has, that the Congress can make the policy and the states may fill the gaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.610" offset="11138348">It may not be so easy in practice, in reality when you are building a dam and we submit that the facts of this project illustrate that difficulty and illustrate, just as Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, that there would be a lot of Court cases on precisely such issues as whether four or ten conditions were not consistent with what petitioners refer to as the specific or the basic Congressional policies behind a project.</text>

            <text syncTime="3214.433" offset="12937662">Indeed the purposes of the Act, and what I would now like to mention because it is with them that the particular conditions have to be compared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.813" offset="12971204">Petitioners here concede that the authorizing Act of this project had eight purposes: flood control, agricultural use of the water that is irrigation, municipal use, and industrial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.562" offset="13046227">Those are four, then fish and wildlife protection, water quality control, power generation, and recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.770" offset="13086978">Pursuant to the Acts authorizing the project, the United States duly applied to the State Water Resources Control Board for permits authorizing it to appropriate the water needed for the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.592" offset="13142253">The United States filed four such applications, two of which were applications for transfers of applications previously filed by a State Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.853" offset="13179347">In brief and rubbing out some of the details, what the United States asked for in these applications was the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.160" offset="13216546">It asked for the a permit to store 2.4 million acre-feet annually, which would be in the reservoir behind the dam and it asked for the right to divert from the river 8,000 cubic-feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.902" offset="13287494">Both of these requests were for all eight of the project purposes, although, I am over simplifying somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.920" offset="13319573">Now, with respect to the purposes, there is a distinction that has to be born in mind and that is between instream and consumptive uses of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.250" offset="13368892">For example, when it sought to divert water for the purposes of fish culture or downstream recreation or water quality control, for those purposes the water is released back into the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.878" offset="13427406">It is stored up in the spring when the water is high and then released in the summer when the river is low for water quality control or for fish or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.808" offset="13471187">Those, thus, are instream uses, to be distinguished are consumptive uses, whereby, the water does not go back into the stream and the consumptive uses are agricultural use that is irrigation or municipal or industrial consumption of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.459" offset="13545793">The other of the eight uses, that is the use for power, is really an instream use. The water is diverted only momentarily through the penstocks of the hydroelectric plant and then goes into the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.465" offset="13609741">Now, to look at the conditions, the 25 conditions that the State Board imposed in granting these permits and I of course do not propose to discuss all 25 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.338" offset="13653313">We have discussed most of them in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.732" offset="13662822">I propose, here, to focus only on two or three of the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.379" offset="13681421">In its decision, and this is at page 31 of Volume 2 of the Appendix, the State Board found there is unappropriated water available to satisfy the demands of the project as proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.080" offset="13780268">But nonetheless, the State Board did not proceed to grant the permits for that unappropriated water that the United States was seeking, rather it imposed these 25 conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.716" offset="13822795">Conditions one and two are the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.123" offset="13836379">They respond directly to the amounts of water that the United States was seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.407" offset="13865532">They substantially deny those amounts despite the Board’s finding that sufficient unappropriated water is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.868" offset="13899386">Again, to oversimplify somewhat what condition one does is that it grants permits for water, but only for certain purposes, not for other purposes that were authorized in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.936" offset="13967723">In brief, it grants permits for the instream purposes, but it denies the United States the right to store or divert water for the consumptive purposes of irrigational use or municipal or industrial consumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="5047.232" offset="20268875">We think that he was wise in declining to do that because he probably saw the difficulties that would entail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.042" offset="20300118">Notice, further, that under petitioner’s theory it would have to be done forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.811" offset="20315164">They contend, for example, you cannot decide now whether some of these conditions are inconsistent with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.173" offset="20340660">You have to wait and see if the conditions are put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.508" offset="20353930">So it would not just be lots of conditions as to each reclamation project, but it would be a continuing series of operational decisions on their theory with respect to each project, all of which would be brought into federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.676" offset="20410668">We submit that because of the difficulties of that kind of a process that those difficulties demonstrate why the very suggestion is unacceptable and why the law should remain, as this Court has held in its well-known Section 8 cases, that the states cannot impose conditions on federal projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.510" offset="20501992">If there are no further questions, I will sit down.</text>

            <text syncTime="5118.612" offset="20554342">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.832" offset="20575240">First, the United States makes the suggestion that there is no issue before this Court whether the federal government must in fact acquire appropriative permits under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.614" offset="20614423">I would respond to that simply that the United States itself raised that very question in this litigation, in its prayer of relief and its complaint for declaratory judgment and that appears at Appendix one, page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.865" offset="20663429">The lower court, responding to the United States’ argument, resolved the issue against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5152.282" offset="20689029">The United States is arguing that the Court should not consider the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.474" offset="20701777">We think that would be an inappropriate way to resolve and pass up on the lower decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.487" offset="20725914">The United States also has discussed at some length the various conditions which were actually imposed upon the Bureau of Reclamation in Decision 1422.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.571" offset="20762172">I caution the Court that there is much more at stake in this case than Decision 1422.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.445" offset="20781711">There are, in fact, a total of 12 decisions issued by California’s Water Resources Control Board that impose conditions upon the Bureau of Reclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.129" offset="20816402">If United States’ claim is upheld in this case, then presumably the conditions in all 12 of those decisions are invalid, not just the conditions in Decision 1422.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.959" offset="20863736">The lower court did not actually evaluate the conditions that are involved in Decision 1422.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.909" offset="20887560">Thus, we do not think there is any kind of adequate record for the Court to examine that question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.957" offset="20907726">If the Court wants to consider that question, it should either decide that the matter has been resolved against the United States or must be resolved against the United States because it did not seek direct judicial review of the conditions, and therefore, is barred by the Doctrine of Resu Dicta or alternatively, should remand the case to the lower court so that it can itself consider the validity of those conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="5237.630" offset="21030502">No, not at all, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.444" offset="21037711">Arizona involved a very peculiar situation that arose under the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.827" offset="21063207">The court, in that case construed the meaning of the Boulder Canyon Project Act which of course involved a reclamation project that utilized the waters of many different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.711" offset="21098733">The court held that the legislative history showed that the federal government under that Act was to have absolute control of water and that any other system would not work because otherwise the project would be subject to the various and even inconsistent commands of different state legislatures, but the Reclamation Act of 1902 has an entirely different legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="5274.719" offset="21178773">In Ivanhoe and Fresno, the Court, as we view the Court’s decisions, merely held that states could not override specific Congressional policies that had been established by Congress either in the Reclamation Act of 1902 or in later Acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="5290.680" offset="21242616">Do you agree with the language in Section 8?</text>

            <text syncTime="5292.410" offset="21249617">There was some certain language that appeared in those decisions that was strictly dictum, Justice White.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="5298.689" offset="21274694">If that dictum is construed against the position we are advocating, we certainly disagree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.268" offset="21297055">It is possible, however, to construe that language only as coming to the conclusion that the states have no right to exercise any veto power over federal projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.218" offset="21332791">If that is the way you construe the language, then it is okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.699" offset="21342717">If it is construed more broadly, as United States would construe it, then we think it is inconsistent with the legislative history of the Reclamation Act of 1902 and thus is wrong.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="5329.008" offset="21396007">Yes, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.550" offset="21410113">I do not want to discuss the conditions at length, but I do think that I should note to the Court that what the United States' argument before the Court today is somewhat different from representations that is already made to this Court with respect to the effect o the terms and conditions of Decision 1422.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.653" offset="21478554">The United States, in fact, advised this Court in another case that with respect to those conditions its only effect, that is Decision 1422’s only effect, would be to diverse slightly the beneficial use of the full conservation yield of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.245" offset="21532888">Most of the project purposes were permitted by the Board’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.640" offset="21546472">The decision does not render the project useless or fundamentally alter its value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.811" offset="21567161">Actually, if you examine the conditions themselves, you find that the United States’ former statement was quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.489" offset="21589940">In fact, California provided, we think, a very balanced response in Decision 1422 to a situation that Congress completely overlooked and could not have foreseen when it authorized the New Melones Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.353" offset="21641349">Specifically, Congress, when it authorized that project intended for the waters to be used n a particular unit of the Central Valley Project known as the east side division, and Congress later abandoned plans for that project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.718" offset="21686802">The Bureau of Reclamation has not developed any kind of alternative plans for that water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.503" offset="21705924">So all the State Board did was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.041" offset="21712088">It simply deferred the Bureau’s right to full impoundment of water until the Bureau came up with a plan and submitted the plan to the State Board for its approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.212" offset="21748764">We think this is a very modest exercise of the right which the states have been given by Congress under Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.548" offset="21774155">The United States, in arguing that the states do not even have this right or essentially asking this Court to abrogate a fundamental and historic principle of the federal reclamation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.640" offset="21810518">That principle, which has always been observed in actual historical practice, is that the states have an essential basic right to control how water is used under the Reclamation Act of 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.126" offset="21852418">The United States in the final analysis is asking this Court to give it powers that it has never got from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.319" offset="21881257">We recommend that the appropriate solution for the United States is to go to Congress and not to come to this Court if it wants to overturn that principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="5467.568" offset="21950221">In fact, Congress specifically amended Section 8 during the course of its passage of Section 8 during the 1902 Reclamation Act to specifically provide for that problem.</text>
