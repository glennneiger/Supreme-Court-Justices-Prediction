            <text syncTime="39.038" offset="236411">Mr. Booty you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="kelvin_h_booty_jr" startTime="41.752" stopTime="94.372">
            <label>Mr. Kelvin H. Booty, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="41.752" offset="247278">Thank you Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.408" offset="261906">The question presented in this case is, must the sheriff give greater access to his county jail facility to the media than he gives to the public?</text>
            <text syncTime="55.832" offset="303598">The purpose of the access in this case is to gather information.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.667" offset="322928">The District Court in this case required that certain access be given to the media.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.958" offset="340065">There was no requirement that similar access be given to the public and there was no determination by the District Court that the public access was inadequate in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.989" offset="388234">The required media access is as I say greater than the sheriff gives to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.407" offset="409864">I would like to discuss briefly with the Court what that public access is.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.256" offset="425224">First of all it is mail, access by mail, there is no censorship, letters are not read.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.995" offset="448212">They are subject to inspection only.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="94.372" stopTime="111.577">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="94.372" offset="457720">Mr. Booty can I interrupt with one question?</text>
            <text syncTime="97.099" offset="468692">Is it not the first question whether there was a violation of law that entitled any remedy which requires an examination of the situation at the time the law it was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.553" offset="502442">Should not you not tell us what kind of access there was when the proceeding started?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kelvin_h_booty_jr" startTime="111.577" stopTime="371.985">
            <label>Mr. Kelvin H. Booty, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="111.577" offset="526579">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.407" offset="533893">All of the access that I am discussing except for the public tours had in fact started when the proceeding started.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.453" offset="582063">So I will answer Your Honor's question in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.841" offset="591572">The mail was there at the time the proceeding started, as I say it was – if the inmate lacked cash to pay for stamps or postage or anything like that, that was provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.660" offset="642876">Secondly at the time the proceeding started and after there is visiting, ample visiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.176" offset="672969">It is unquestioned that it is ample there are no categories of persons who may visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.458" offset="698047">They need not be members of the family or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.028" offset="708391">Anyone including a reporter could visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.235" offset="717168">There are some restrictions on those who have been in prison or those who are under18, the prison restriction stems from provisions in the California Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.134" offset="764816">Again at the time the proceeding started there was access by telephones for those who were in the maximum security facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.211" offset="801074">There was telephone access on a collect basis to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.571" offset="818523">The phone lines did not go through the sheriff's department in anyway they went right to the telephone company.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.431" offset="837959">So there was no monitoring, no capacity for us to find out who was called?</text>
            <text syncTime="194.327" offset="857603">What was said, nothing totally open telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.656" offset="870873">Other than in the maximum security facility telephone access was through the correctional services or officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.857" offset="903683">Again Mr. Justice Stevens at the time the proceeding started there were interviews with pretrial detainees available.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.493" offset="938269">Those could be done, in fact they would have been done typically off the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.083" offset="960630">Those could have been photographed, tape recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.444" offset="974004">They would be private; no one from the sheriff's department would be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.752" offset="991245">The requirement there is that consents previously be obtained from the inmate himself, from his counsel, from the District attorney and from the court having jurisdiction over the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.747" offset="1043281">What was not present at the time the proceedings commenced were the tours.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.735" offset="1071180">However as I believe, it is in Appendix page 10 -- beg Your pardon page 19 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.704" offset="1175043">I am reading from the affidavit of Mr. Turner who was counsel for the plaintiffs then and now as on June 10 a week before the proceedings were filed, he spoke again with me and I told him about the tour.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.661" offset="1246932">So for the situation, at the time the proceedings commenced was that the tours were planed and scheduled and it was well known to everyone including these plaintiffs, that they in fact would begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.846" offset="1307640">It is true that they had not in fact begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.953" offset="1316104">It was necessary for the Sheriff to secure funding from the Board of Supervisors, he had to go -- in a bureaucracy those things take time, unfortunately we cannot just spring to action.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.416" offset="1365945">The tours cover as the record shows virtually the entire facility, there is no screening of any visitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.878" offset="1403771">It is -- the record indicates that many of the places are just taken by ordinary citizens, people who have a curiosity about what is going on in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.929" offset="1443999">The tour does not see any inmates, no inmates are -- I better be specific on that, you certainly might see them you do not talk to them, there is no communication between inmates and the members of the tour.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.741" offset="1495199">The tours at that time were 25 persons, they are now approximately 30 and there is only four guards so plainly, conversation between inmates and in visitors is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.481" offset="1546190">No cameras are permitted on the tours and no tape recorders are permitted on the tours.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="371.985" stopTime="381.875">
            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="371.985" offset="1568238">What opportunity did members of the media have to become one of the 25 admitted on these tours?</text>

            <text syncTime="381.875" offset="1607735">They had at the commencement of the tours Your Honor, better access than anyone else because the announcement of the tours was made through the media.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.321" offset="1641485">It was in fact a suggestion by some of the members of the board, the Supervisors that the first tour should be set aside entirely for the media and the discussion – that suggestion was rejected on the grounds that if they wanted to go, they knew about it before anyone else and so all they had to do was file --</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="410.744" offset="1723196">Basically the tours were organized on a first come first serve basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.264" offset="1789338">They became, the first six months of the tours became booked very quickly, quite possibly before the end of July, the first tour was on July 14, 1975 and probably before I do not remember, my recollection Your Honor is that before the end of July the tours had been booked.</text>

          <turn speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="447.199" stopTime="465.345">
            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="447.199" offset="1869064">And so if there were some occurrence in the jail that might have been of public interest there would be no way for representing it to the media to get into the jail unless he had been signed up several weeks in advance?</text>

            <text syncTime="465.345" offset="1941580">That is correct, he could not have gone on one of tours, that of course is not the only means of access Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.343" offset="1969583">Had there been an occurrence in the jail indeed before the tours ever started, the media can and does have alternate means of finding out what is going on, by means of interviews, I have not completed the access that is now and was then available to the media.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.069" offset="2228509">Are these designed to cover the situation supposing a riot had broken out in the jail or in some event a particular newsworthiness, would these regulations have necessarily governed press or public access under those circumstances?</text>

            <text syncTime="551.167" offset="2284933">Yes, it would, there is nothing in the record and in the case Your Honor to indicate any alternative means to these and as I say I am not finished, but this media or pardon me this access package taken as a whole is the entire package.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.697" offset="2351075">So if there had been a riot or a fire or something like that, then the means of access for the media are through alternative means such as interviews or something of that nature with participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.945" offset="2411993">Not the capacity to go in with their cameras, at least on demand, there is one, I do want to get into one specific media access that the media alone has and that is special tours with the cameras and with tapes on a scheduled basis, that is critical, not on demand, but on a scheduled basis there is no fix schedule, whatever schedule the District Court had in mind and as the keys turned out there was no schedule propagated, but this Sheriff is still willing to do that, that is part of it, of course finally the release bus to contact inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.264" offset="2597358">Alright that completes Your Honors the access that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.872" offset="2627764">The complaint of KQED with respect to this, is that there is no random interviews on the tours, that no inmates are on view for their cameras in cells or barracks or eating for televising and that there is no access on demand for their equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.893" offset="2715849">As I have just indicated there is access with their equipment on a schedule basis, but not on demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.724" offset="2743121">The District Court did not make any finding of any intention to conceal conditions in the jail, but nevertheless, the District Court made its injunction which requires the Sheriff to allow what it called full and accurate news coverage and specifically required the Sheriff to permit random interviews on the tours and to permit the use of cameras and tapes and plainly not on the schedule tour, but on a demand tour.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.524" offset="2866314">The only exception stated in the District Court's memorandum and injunction was that when tensions in fact existed the Sheriff could put a stop to it, stop to the access.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.907" offset="2915843">In fact the District Court virtually invited litigation on the point because it says, if anybody thinks there really is no tension they can come in and we will have a hearing on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.277" offset="2957325">So what the District Court did then is it balanced the asserted media needs against the Sheriff's public access program.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.558" offset="2986478">There was no balancing by the District Court of the public's rights in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.095" offset="3008630">The District Court did not address the public rights in anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.562" offset="13338491">The Court has asked some questions about visiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.987" offset="13352179">It is true that if you happen to know any inmate, you may visit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.857" offset="13371719">Any prisoner could write to any member of the press or could telephone him and ask him to come over on a Sunday or if he is a pretrial detainee on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.434" offset="13418007">We are talking about consents, the requirement of consents, why does the Sheriff require consents from all Attorneys and the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.379" offset="13457818">It seems that the likelihood of harm from an interview with a pretrial detainee is to the detainee himself and it is the Sheriff's view that he should, he would rather stay out of that and have the parties and the Attorneys and the Courts who are responsible, decide whether an interview with filming and with recorders is to be permitted or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.952" offset="13556039">I do want to point out to the Court that the access where the public in our case is greater than the public access was in Pell, for instance, in Pell the mail access was subject to censoring with appropriate due process protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.024" offset="13632316">In our case the mail is totally uncensored.</text>
