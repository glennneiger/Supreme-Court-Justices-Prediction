            <text syncTime="47.812" offset="191216">This case is before the Court on cross motions for entry of a third supplemental decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.146" offset="212532">The areas in dispute are two one mile belts of water and submerged lands surrounding the two islands which together comprised the Channel Islands National Monument and I invite the Court’s attention to page 68 of the appendix, beige document which contains a diagram or a map of the area in dispute and the surrounding area.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.637" offset="306469">Anacapa Island is about 12 miles off shore and Santa Barbara Island about 35 miles off shore the coast of the California.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.256" offset="340950">The Islands themselves are about 40 miles apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.837" offset="359340">These islands were established as the Channel Islands National Monument in 1938 by presidential proclamation of President Roosevelt.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.297" offset="393091">In 1949, both parties agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.373" offset="405420">President Truman, in a presidential proclamation, expanded the monument by adding to it and I quote from his proclamation which is on page 67 of the appendix, adding to it “the areas within one nautical mile of the shore line of the Anacapa and Santa Barbara Islands as indicated on diagram,” the diagram being that on page 68.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.974" offset="495804">The United States believes that by this language President Truman added to the monument everything within one mile of each of the island.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan A. Ryan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="152.280" offset="609071">We believe that proclamation added to the monument everything within one mile of the shoreline; waters submerge lands and natural resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.839" offset="647314">This conclusion is supported not only the words and the diagram of the proclamation itself but by the executive history of the proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.559" offset="682214">California contends that President Truman added only rocks and islets within one mile of the islands, although California candidly concedes that both the language and the executive history of the proclamation do not unequivocally support its reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.406" offset="741564">If this Court decides that President Truman did indeed include the waters and submerged lands within one mile in it's proclamation, it must ten decide the second issue presented by this case, i.e. did the Submerged Lands Act of 1953 cede these lands and waters to California as California contends, or were they exempted by Section 5 of that act which provides that the United States will retain lands occupied by claim of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.938" offset="851696">As to the first issue, the primary dispute between the parties centers on what President Truman meant by the word areas, when he added “the areas within one nautical mile of the shore lines” of the two islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.034" offset="904046">The word “areas” is of course far more inclusive than the specific words of rocks and islets and California has yet to suggest why if President Truman had intended to include only rocks and islets, he would have used such as expansive and inaccurate word as “areas.”</text>
            <text syncTime="242.002" offset="967993">Furthermore the map or diagram on page 68 which was incorporated by reference in to the proclamation, shows a boundary line running one mile around both islands with acreage figures that describe the total surface area of the islands into the one mile of water surrounding the islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.636" offset="1042495">Finally the diagram does not depict a single rock or islet within the boundary line except for some rocks that lie a few hundred yards off the shore of Santa Barbara and obviously no one mile boundary was necessary to include them.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.108" offset="1096411">California has yet to explain why a proclamation that was designed to include rocks and islets within the boundaries of the monument omitted to describe or depict those objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.091" offset="1140297">In all we believe it’s clear that the proclamation did exactly what it said it was doing, adding all areas within one mile of the islands and the areas cannot be reasonably understood to mean nearly some rocks and islets, but must mean the waters, lands, natural resources in short everything within one mile of the two islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.919" offset="1227651">The parties have collected the various memos, letters, and other materials which led up to the signing of this proclamation a sort of legislative history as it were and if any doubt as to the scope of the proclamation exits, this history certainly removes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.409" offset="1281567">In a nutshell this history reveals that after President Roosevelt established the Channel Islands National Monument in 1938 by reserving the islands themselves, it was almost immediately realized that those boundaries were inadequate to protect the wide variety of marine mammals and plant life that thrived in the waters around the islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.213" offset="1364846">Federal officials and naturalists agree that federal jurisdiction should extend into the water, but at that time, California and the United States were engaged in litigation before this Court to determine who owned the three-mile belt beyond the coast of California and these islands I might add politically are part of the State of California so that the three-mile question at issue involve these islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.596" offset="1462335">In view of the conflicting claims that were then before the California, the United States during this period of the mid 40s took no definitive action to expand the monument because there was doubt that it had the legal power to do so, regardless of how advisable such action might have been from a naturalist standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.622" offset="1530462">That question of course was settled by this Court in 1947 in favor of the United States when this Court held in the first California decision that the United States had paramount rights over the land, minerals and other things in the Pacific Ocean lying seaward of the low water mark.</text>

            <text syncTime="971.904" offset="3887543">I am sure that had – those tidelands been available President Truman would have included them and that would have been the only sensible way to do it, but as a matter of the law at least since Pollard's Lessee those lands were not available to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.696" offset="3950759">And I would say that whatever problems our presented to the administration by this 6 foot or whatever it is section of tidelands are something that can be worked out between California and the United States and I would agree that it is a not a reason to find in California's favor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.748" offset="4042919">I think it's important to note that when the question came up not only in the or especially in the post of proclamation administration period of this area, as to whether the federal government had jurisdiction over submerged lands, the National Park Service which was charged with the administration of the area specifically referred to the submerged lands as being under it's jurisdiction and the parties have been able to find no evidence that California ever contested that interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.031" offset="6872085">So at least as far as the tidelands are concerted, we think that we should have decree affirmatively stating that California owns those tidelands and that clearly specifying what the shoreline of Anacapa Island is?</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.630" offset="6922449">The United States proposed supplemental decree would nearly exclude them from the proclamation and not affirmatively state that California has its right adjudicated by this Court and the fact we have the right to administer those tidelands and exercise jurisdiction over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.636" offset="6994442">Now that does present if the federal position prevails this problem of what appear to be concentric realms and we submit that the interpretation of the 1949 proclamation which the government presents here is an erroneous interpretation of that proclamation and as a matter of law the proclamation must be construed as not to have added either the submerged lands of the one-mile belt around each of the two islands or the waters of the Pacific Ocean that are above those submerged lands and we submit that that follows for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.431" offset="7141669">First of all if we examine the use of the word “areas,” the preamble to the proclamation which normally we would refer to, to discover the intent of the President or in a case of a statute the intent of Congress, only refers to the islets and rocks that are located in the one-mile belt and then it at a later point in the -- in the preamble there is a reference to the areas here in after described, very – and making it very unclear what those areas will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.496" offset="7281894">The use of the word “areas” as we analyze the definition of the word “areas” normally connotes surface or is a term of surface reference, another word “a two dimensional reference” which in it's normal usage would only include the surface of the waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.272" offset="7349081">Indeed there is one document that's cited in the Federal Government's brief, which the specifically indicates an intent on the part of the National Park Service to add only waters and I refer to the U.S. brief at page 15 and their reference to join a appendix page 13, a park service memorandum that suggests the addition of surface areas only.</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.295" offset="7689091">There is not one reference and they can sight no where to the record to a reference to submerged lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.668" offset="7742589">And as we make the point, in Executive Order 9633 in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.477" offset="7765891">President Truman had already reserved the submerged lands of the continental shelf for future to legislation so that they couldn't have been added to this monument unless there was a repeal by implication of the 1945 proclamation and that's a point that the United States does not answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.973" offset="7847811">There has to have been that revocation by implication and that revocation by implication can not stand here because the information taken out from the language out of the proclamation, the information that we have from the executive history, points in many directions, but it does not support any claim to submerged lands being added to the -- to the monument in 1949 and I think that's the relevant point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.960" offset="7971840">It suggests at most while it clearly adds the rocks and islets within the one-mile belt because their names are specifically in the proclamation and it may add the surface areas of the water and some rights in the water areas but we submit under the Antiquity's Act, the waters is alone could not have been added to the monument in and off themselves without submerged lands --</text>

            <label>Mr. Russell Iungerich</label>
            <text syncTime="3101.054" offset="12404193">Because that would have involved an extensive factual issue and I think probably that the federal government would have prevailed on that issue and that was a attachable judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.074" offset="12456229">In conclusion California submits that first with regard to the interpretation of the proclamation, we have a concession on the part of the federal government that both the language of the proclamation does not cover the tidelands and that under those circumstances California submits that it is entitled to an affirmative decree such as it proposes, recognizing it's rights on those tidelands and not really excluding the tidelands as the federal government does from it's decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.082" offset="12584229">We also submit that the interpretation of the 1949 proclamation should be such that it should indicate that the submerged lands have been placed in Executive Order 9633 in 1945 and therefore since there is an ambiguity as to what was actually placed, in 1949 in the Channel Islands National Monument by the enlargement of - without a repeal by implication of the 45 proclamation as a matter of law and by a established cannons of statutory construction applied in this case to a proclamation there should be determination as a matter of law that this proclamation is interpreted as non including submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.577" offset="12778266">If it doesn't include submerged lands our argument is that waters alone could not have been added just the waters above the submerged lands because the Antiquity's Act only permits the addition of lands owned or controlled by the government of the United States and it's doesn't allow the reservation of waters per se without lands beneath them or without lands adjacent to them having been placed within the national monument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.785" offset="12883069">We further submit that as to the claim of right exception, the basic point here again and I emphasize that is that we look to the claim of right as being the underling claim that the federal government has that it owned or controlled those lands in 1945 and again we submit that the claim of right is not a reservation in and off itself because it -- a proclamation such as this, works no magic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.090" offset="13000307">It doesn't improve the quality of the federal government's title it doesn't make the federal government own something that it does not own and it does not take a reservation that was based solely on the fact that the federal government was adjudicated in 1949 to own in one sense or control in another sense the submerged lands of the one mile belt and metaphors - have a work in metamorphosis of that claim into something that is separate and apart from the paramount rights doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.844" offset="13135308">And I think that's the -- the fundamental point at least as far as our case on either of these two points I think that the decree proposed by California should be adopted by this Court and that judgment should be in favor of the state of California with respect to this decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.572" offset="13406250">We -- the United States has contended that the President accomplished the same thing by the word areas and I don't see any need to go over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.365" offset="13437388">The second part of California's argument on this point is that the 1945 Executive Order, reserving the Outer Continental Shelves, was not revoked by implication in the 1949 Proclamation as it should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.306" offset="13505202">I think the answer to that is to consider that the Executive Order of 1945 does the following and I quote from the order itself, as to the Outer Continental Shelf it is “placed under the jurisdiction and control of the Secretary of the Interior for administrative purposes pending the enactment of legislation in regard thereto” and there it stood from 1945-1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.956" offset="13611781">In 1949, two square miles of the 400,000 square mile Outer Continental Shelf, one four thousand of one percent is conveyed if you will or transferred from the Secretary of the Interior back to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.865" offset="13679386">It is taken out of that category in which it was in as a result of the 45 degree and it is given back to the President who then proclaims it to be a National Monument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.503" offset="13721913">Now to call this a revocation by implication if that's the test then that's what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.491" offset="13745946">Regardless of what one calls it is very clear that the land went to the Secretary of the Interior in 1945 as part of the Outer Continental Shelf and two square miles of it came back four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.456" offset="13793802">There is no problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.160" offset="13800594">There is no necessity for the 1949 proclamation to say we revoke one four thousand of one percent of the 1945 proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.797" offset="13839151">That's looking for things that shouldn't be there in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.743" offset="14186893">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.092" offset="14196297">There is for example in 16 U.S.C. 433 it is a criminal offense to molest property on a national monument.</text>
