            <text syncTime="59.885" offset="319467">This a direct appeal from the District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, which declared a Wisconsin State Statute imposing a marriage, certain marriage requirement unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.666" offset="390624">The facts in this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.945" offset="415702">The named plaintiff Redhail, six years ago approximately fathered a baby girl out of wedlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.194" offset="460737">At that time he was in high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.568" offset="474216">Two years subsequent he applied for permission to marry to the county clerk of Milwaukee county of the State of Wisconsin, because of a marriage requirement, the clerk denied him a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.766" offset="558957">The requirement that was the basis for the denial by the county clerk was that a person who has minor children, not in his custody to whom he has an obligation to support must get permission from a Court to marry.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.432" offset="657700">In Mr. Redhail's case he had never been married.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.025" offset="675986">We suspect the bulk of the cases arising where there has been -- where there is a requirement to get a Court's permission to marry are those cases involving people who have been divorced, who have been married before.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.838" offset="759264">At this point Mr. Redhail filed a complaint with the District Court for the eastern district of Wisconsin petitioning the Court to declare the Statute unconstitutional because it infringed or impinged upon his Constitutional right to marry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.614" offset="9126389">Yes, that is right and after, well after all argument had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.100" offset="9160348">Your Honor, the State in its brief proposed to this Court that because that this is a statute dealing with marriage and divorce, the State has peculiar interest in that area and therefore this Court should supply a rational relationship, equal protection or I suppose, substantive Due Process analysis to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.303" offset="9269122">The State in my opinion gave no good reason why that should be the case, we are aware of cases both in marriage and divorce and in voting and probate where this Court has held that States have a peculiar interest in those areas, but we do not believe that the Court has ever gone so far as to hold that regulations which adversely effect serious long standing fundamental, constitutional rights are going to be completely deferred to by the State by the application of the rational relationship equal protection test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.349" offset="9429305">Concerning the purposes of the statute, the State argued in the Lower Court that the purposes of the statute was the provision of counseling to persons who are about to go -- undergo marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.658" offset="9474549">I bring that up, only because the only legislative history available in behind the statute which is cited at pages 29 through 32 of our brief indicates that, that in fact was the benevolent purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.108" offset="9540378">It was to provide counseling for persons who had support obligations and were about to undergo marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.209" offset="9568799">This statute obviously has nothing to do with counseling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.090" offset="9580293">Counseling is not even mentioned in the confines of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.221" offset="9600773">Courts are not encouraged or mandated to give counseling, nor are applicants to the Courts encouraged to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.901" offset="9639538">So, if counseling is still the purpose of the statute, it is completely irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.588" offset="9670258">The reason most seriously forward by the State, presently in this appeal is that this statute protects the interests that Mr. Redhail's child has to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.255" offset="9736923">We do not believe that either is the intent of the statute Mr. Redhail's child has been supported by under the AFDC program almost since her birth that is if the first child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.219" offset="9788750">The debt that Mr. Redhail owes is not to that child, the debt that he owes is to the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.772" offset="9819052">What Wisconsin is saying in affect to Mr. Redhail is that until you pay us you can not get married</text>

            <text syncTime="2447.659" offset="9870565">Mr. Redhail went to paternity Court in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.081" offset="9888224">He admitted paternity in that action and the Court ordered that he pay support of $109 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.238" offset="9920825">That although as the State agreed he was a minor and a high school student, well in any event the AFDC which he received -- which his child is receiving is substantially above $109 per month, that he was ordered to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.838" offset="9995326">Therefore what I am saying is that even if Mr. Redhail tomorrow came into the clerk of Court with all of his arrearages under that $109 support order and paid every cent of that even pay the $109 sometime into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.581" offset="10070245">He still could not get married because his child would still be count – would still remain a public charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.471" offset="10101801">So, how the State can justify the statute by saying that--</text>
