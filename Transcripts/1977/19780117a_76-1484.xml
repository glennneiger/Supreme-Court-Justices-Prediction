            <label>Mr. W. Eric Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="81.933" offset="408351">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.657" offset="431234">These consolidated cases come to you on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit which affirmed a summary judgment affording declaratory relief in the federal Civil Rights Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.902" offset="492256">The case involves search warrants and attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.350" offset="513990">I appear on behalf of the District Attorney and his deputy and I shall state the case to you and attempt to argue the search issues and the fees issues insofar as they affect prosecutorial and judicial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.547" offset="586820">Mr. Robert Booth Jr. here will appear on behalf of Chief Zurcher and police petitioners and will argue those fees issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.011" offset="632691">He will take ten minutes, I would like Mr. Chief Justice to reserve a couple of minutes for rebuttal, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.290" offset="669784">On Friday, April 09, 1971, the Medical Director of Stanford University Hospital called upon the police to remove a group of demonstrators who had barricaded themselves in Stanford University Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.127" offset="753167">Now, the main action and the press and the police was on the west side of building.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.131" offset="785141">Though the demonstrators had barricaded the doors, chained them shut and papered over the glass panels.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.760" offset="823698">The police attempted to force the doors and were driven back by a shower of heavy missiles, several were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.173" offset="865285">Eventually, ropes were brought, one door was dragged partly open.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.203" offset="885451">The chains were cut and the police got in to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.383" offset="902170">Now, they tried at first of course unsuccessfully to persuade these people to move peacefully, to put this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.185" offset="941353">Now, that was on the West side; on the East side there were also doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.467" offset="962460">These two have been barricaded and papered over preventing police identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.125" offset="1001122">When the police broke in the West side suddenly the doors on the East side were opened and all the demonstrators erupted out.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.046" offset="1040828">Now, on the East side there was a squad of eight men, four were facing to the rear where there were sympathizers in the hall and four were facing the glass doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.616" offset="1091087">They attempted to hold the battle on line and were successful for 4 or 5 seconds, but were clubbed to the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.364" offset="1134033">All nine were injured, three survived.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.503" offset="1150647">They could not identify their attackers.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.061" offset="1164857">That was on Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.380" offset="1174157">Now, the following Sunday, a special edition of the Stanford Daily, the student newspaper was published.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.500" offset="1210624">That showed the clip, that a photographer or one of them of that newspaper had been in a position where he could have seen and photographed the East side and that is what we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.132" offset="1293171">The police went to the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.413" offset="1306232">District Attorney Brown asking for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.761" offset="1327652">Brown had had previous experience with this newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.292" offset="1345833">In the 1969 rights, he had subpoena the editor and one of the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.923" offset="1384286">The subpoenas had been unsuccessful, the editor testified to the effect that a few of the photographs were available, the others have been misplaced as stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.228" offset="1441546">The defense have had full access to the photographs and he had done the best he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.768" offset="1467669">Another staffer had the temerity to testify that the photographs were dangerous to have around and some had been sent to Tokyo for safekeeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.774" offset="1519704">Now, this was the District Attorney’s experience at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.787" offset="1543737">He decided with the officer to apply for a search warrant, a search warrant pursuant to California law which specifically authorizes the seizure of evidence from any person or place, provided of course, there is probable cause in the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.400" offset="1626180">Judge Forbes of the Palo Alto Municipal court issued the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.947" offset="1652407">He authorized a search for film, negatives and photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.760" offset="1671633">The warrant was executed at 5.30 on Monday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.847" offset="1692008">The officers asked for, but did not get cooperation in producing the photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.098" offset="1728998">After waiting a few minutes, they searched the photo lab and the main in office which was in some considerable disarray.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.280" offset="1769749">They searched the desktops, unlocked drawers, filing tubs and I add, no materials were read.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.561" offset="1814888">As far as possible they returned everything to the place where it was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.958" offset="1836413">During this search, the officers were subjected to harassing clients and they were photographed many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.158" offset="1873298">No claim of confidentiality was made by any member of the staff at any time to any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.906" offset="1908198">The search lasted 15 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.803" offset="1919796">Nothing was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.087" offset="1932962">One month later, in May 1971, the Stanford Daily filed suit in federal District Court seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.284" offset="1981758">Affidavits were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.318" offset="1985938">Depositions were noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.459" offset="1998477">But before the depositions of the Stanford Daily’s witnesses could be taken, the motion for summary judgment was granted and declaratory relief was afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.088" offset="2053020">This was in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.392" offset="2070157">The District Court laid down two new rules; one, in all third party searches that is to say searches of persons who are not suspect of crime, in addition to the historical requirements of particularity and specificity and probable cause, the affidavit must also contain, probable cause to believe that the materials would be destroyed or removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.316" offset="2201918">All but otherwise a subpoena was impractical, at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.940" offset="2232429">There was a special rule where First Amendment values are involved, this time said the Court then must be a clear showing that first, the materials are important and secondly the restraining order would be futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.944" offset="2328351">In 973, attorney’s fees were awarded by separate opinion on a private Attorney General’s theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.149" offset="2373177">In 1974, these fees were set at $47,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.085" offset="2412988">In 1977, the Ninth Circuit adopted the search opinion, but they used the 1976 Civil Rights fees Awards Act, Attorney’s Fees Awards Act to authorize the grant of fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.613" offset="2507029">And then confirmed the District Court’s calculation of $47,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.577" offset="2542973">Rehearing and suggestions for hearing en banc were denied and these petitions coming forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.931" offset="2572335">Those are the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.335" offset="2605980">Your Honors, it is our essential position that the District Court and indeed now counsel, did not realize the extent of the rule they fashioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.544" offset="2926764">May I remind this court that it reads as follows; negatives which can be used to convict protesters will be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.792" offset="2967829">The Daily feels no obligation to help in the prosecution of the students for crimes related to political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.193" offset="3001370">That was the thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.968" offset="3008475">Now, in all fairness to the date I mentioned, and and afterwards that policy was somewhat amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.363" offset="3042121">Now, it apparently is the standing policy as to destroy all potentially incriminating, unpublished photographic material.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.459" offset="3090500">I might add that even on those, the board was split and as to these particular events involving the injuries and the damages caused, the board split 50-50, 50% it warranted and 50 unwarranted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.231" offset="6285589">We dealt with those problems and the practical law enforcement kinds of problems which they perceive to arise from that opinion in our reply brief and which we suggested that the power of the police to search non-press third parties is at least subject to the rule of overall reasonableness and that five factors which we summarized on page 41 of our brief made this search in this case unreasonable on these facts as demonstrated to the magistrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.144" offset="7697246">None of those factors would apply, I take it where the police are simply in doubt about who the third party is or perhaps have some suspicions that do not rise to probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.217" offset="7741445">Our position, our submission on that matter would permit a third party search in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.923" offset="7884282">I think the District Court and the Court of Appeals were right ultimately but I do not think I have to convince you of that for this judgment to be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.397" offset="7910196">This case involved the newspaper and the interesting thing about the briefs in this case is that the parties almost pass in the night on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.271" offset="7941752">We spent all of our time discussing the facts of this case in the legal consequences therefrom with the First Amendment by that is required in cases where First Amendment interests hang in the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.154" offset="7993265">The Solicitor General, on Saturday he filed a brief to which we filed a response yesterday in which the Government concedes that there are no law enforcement interests that are impaired by a rule requiring the police to proceed by subpoena, when seeking material from the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.583" offset="8066931">So we can put that issue aside, no substantial law enforcement issues are presented in any of the briefs in this case as to that part of the case and that is what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.690" offset="8107368">Now, I would like to stress that we do not question, the issue that was raised in Branzburg concerning the duty of a press to produce evidence when it is sought by law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.720" offset="8167450">No issue of privilege is presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.219" offset="8177481">The question is not whether an evidence may be obtained from a newspaper but how that evidence is to be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.784" offset="8203708">It is a question not of substance, but of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.763" offset="8215620">That distinction to my mind answers the objection in the arguments of petitioners but we seek some special privilege from the press and we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.490" offset="8250624">Those cases such as Powell and the Sacks on which petitioners relied for the proposition that the Court has declined to give special privileges to the press involve claims of substantive rights or claims of substantive exemptions from duties that other citizens have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.463" offset="8314467">All of this case involves is a question of process, by what process shall evidence be obtained from the the press when it is sought.</text>
