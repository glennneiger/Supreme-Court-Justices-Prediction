            <text syncTime="64.211" offset="336800">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.712" offset="350802">I am Ray McClain of Charleston, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.782" offset="363027">I represent Edna Smith of Columbia, South Carolina, a member of the Bar of this Court who is seated to my left this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.278" offset="393015">Ms. Smith is before this Court seeking reversal of professional disciplinary punishment imposed on her for advising one Mary Etta Williams that the services of the American Civil Liberties Union were definitely available to Mrs. Williams, with whom she had previously consulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.518" offset="465949">Mrs. Williams was a welfare recipient in Aiken, a small community in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.083" offset="488206">Mrs. Williams had been sterilized in early July, 1973 as a condition of her receiving treatment as a Medicaid patient by a physician in Aiken.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.090" offset="544317">This case presents important questions, both under the First Amendment and the due process clause, the due process clause particularly as to the vagueness of the rules as construed by the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.518" offset="614011">I shall limit my comments here to those issues relating to various aspects of the First Amendment concerned and rely to the briefs as to other due process matters, unless the Court has specific questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.104" offset="668346">It is our position that this case is squarely controlled by this Court’s opinion in NAACP v. Button, a decision in which the organizational activities of the American Civil Liberties Union were expressly referred to, and referred to with approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.600" offset="738354">That decision, as it has been amplified in the cases of Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia, United Mine Workers v. Illinois, and United Transportation Union v. Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.706" offset="794779">The force of those cases, we submit, has been augmented also by this Court’s decision last term in Bates v. the State Bar of Arizona, where the Court extended the application of these prior associational cases to protect advertising of the availability and price of legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.738" offset="898851">Based on these prior decisions --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="207.195" offset="908673">Would you suggest that the right to face-to-face solicitation is co-extensive with the right to advertise and announce the fees which will be charged for a particular service?</text>

            <text syncTime="222.310" offset="969172">Certainly not co-extensive, but to the extent that the same interests of providing information for informed decision making by the person to whom the information is directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.285" offset="1029045">First Amendment concerns are equally relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.803" offset="1047122">The balancing of interests may be different.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="245.015" offset="1059974">Do you suggest that a face-to-face solicitation by an trained lawyer on the one hand and the untrained layman, untrained at least in the law, presents the same arm’s length factors as an announcement in the paper of a schedule of fees?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ray P. McClain</label>
            <text syncTime="267.275" offset="1148999">Well, in the first place, I think I should point out that in this case the conduct which is alleged to be solicitation, the letter which was written by Ms. Smith, was not a face-to-face confrontation of that sort.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="280.698" offset="1202707">I was beginning by relating it to the case which we just heard argued.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ray P. McClain</label>
            <text syncTime="284.357" offset="1217335">Right and with respect to it, I think that clearly anytime there is a face-to-face confrontation, there are other factors operating that are not operating in a written communication.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="298.293" stopTime="304.997">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="298.293" offset="1273133">Do you think the written letter is equated roughly to the announcement in the newspaper?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ray P. McClain</label>
            <text syncTime="304.997" offset="1299882">I think it is closer to that certain event than an in-person solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.544" offset="1330080">The scope of the First Amendment protection, as we read the Button case and the succeeding cases, is that it protects associational activity to initiate litigation and to support litigation in so far as such litigation may further legitimate goals of the organization by assuring meaningful access to the Courts and that meaningful access does not depend on whether or not the persons who are being informed of their rights are members of the association or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.142" offset="1468529">They were not in the Button case.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.694" offset="1478664">Obviously, the information disseminated in the Bates case was not disseminated to any particular limited association or group.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.836" offset="1523282">Further, attorneys may participate in such organizational and associational activities with a similar First Amendment constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.713" offset="1574795">Indeed, the parallels that this case presents with the Button case are very striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.005" offset="1599977">A very important activity of the NAACP in Button was providing legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.897" offset="1623487">The Court said it had an extensive program of providing legal services to aggrieved parties in certain types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.845" offset="1663298">That is similar to the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.598" offset="1678344">The NAACP limited the scope at the outset of its undertaking representation of anyone, but thereafter, exercised no control over the actual conduct of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.299" offset="1729126">The ACLU follows a similar practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.768" offset="1743024">In button, attorneys really rather aggressively solicited parties, who according to the opinion in the Virginia Supreme Court had never expressed any interest in litigating, had no idea they would be met by an attorney when they went to various community meetings and yet attorneys were there, participating in the attempt to persuade people at these meetings to join lawsuits to attack practices of segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.648" offset="1858485">Those attorneys, in this litigation that followed, were compensated on something which was not the case with respect to ACLU attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.400" offset="1905505">The matter here, as in Button, was a suit attacking government practices and in this case, the provision of Medicaid services.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.501" offset="1949913">In this case Mr. McClain, your client pursued a little more aggressively than in Button, did she not?</text>
            <text syncTime="476.651" offset="1986485">Why was she not present at the initial meeting and then was told that if the client wished to employ her services, the client would let her know and then, nonetheless, your client followed up with a second solicitation?</text>

            <text syncTime="491.906" offset="2047507">The record does not really reflect that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.424" offset="2061613">The only thing that is clearly reflected by the record is that one Gary Allen who had organized the meeting was, according to Mrs. Williams’ testimony, advised that she would call if Mrs. Williams wanted further assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.765" offset="2130994">The record is not clear that Ms. Smith was ever told that.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.671" offset="2150638">The attorney general at the hearing never asked Ms. Smith whether she had told that.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.673" offset="2222632">I believe that the record is clear that Ms. Smith wrote a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.407" offset="2245515">I do not believe that it can fairly be characterized as an attempt to persuade her.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.810" offset="2267144">In her testimony, she explicitly stated that she was not trying to persuade anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.976" offset="2295775">In fact, Mrs. Williams testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.271" offset="2304970">The only evidence that Mrs. Williams, the person allegedly solicited, had on the question of persuasion was that Edna Smith had not attempted to persuade or pressure her in any way to file a lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.672" offset="2366619">Well, putting to one side the characterization of the letter which maybe subject to reasonable interpretations on both sides, that follow-up letter is a fact that was not present in Button, is it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="608.739" offset="2514890">I am not sure whether your colloquy with Mr. Justice Rehnquist refers to the letter which I thought was the only letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.894" offset="2551461">Let me read a part of it and see, she wrote and said “you will probably remember me from talking with you at Mr. Allen’s office in July about the sterilization performed on you.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.093" offset="2592317">The American Civil Liberties Union would like to file a lawsuit on your behalf for money against the doctor.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.662" offset="2626589">That is the letter we are talking about, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.600" offset="2634322">The letter goes on to state in addition in the next paragraph, in fact there in the next sentence she said “we will be coming to Aiken in the near future and would like to explain what is involved,” this is page 9 of the state’s brief, so you can understand what is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.091" offset="2740274">The next paragraph proposes a magazine interview if Mrs. Williams is interested in publicizing the issue of forced sterilizations, which Ms. Smith makes quite clear that it is totally up to Mrs. Williams whether she would participate in that interview or not and asks in the last paragraph about the lawsuit, “If you are interested, let me know.”</text>
            <text syncTime="693.829" offset="2855213">There is really no persuasive content to this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.026" offset="2872036">In fact, as it was characterized by Ms. Smith in her testimony before the hearing panel, this letter was essentially an attempt to advise Mrs. Williams that the ACLU would in fact give Mrs. Williams assistance if she wanted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.621" offset="2954374">We have to take into consideration, Your Honor, the fact that Mrs. Williams was relatively uneducated, that Ms. Smith had perceived her as not being very well-informed about her rights and not understanding the initial conversation very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.652" offset="3022501">This was simply a letter in which there was an attempt made to be sure Mrs. Williams had considered the matter fully before she decided what she was going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.887" offset="3067432">Mrs. Williams, shortly thereafter, called Ms. Smith and said “I am not interested in bringing a lawsuit” and that was the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.243" offset="3104839">Mrs. Williams never made any complaint to any agency that she had been pressured by Ms. Smith or never complained in any way about Ms. Smith’s conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2331.215" offset="9404738">Mr. Allen requested Mrs. Williams to accompany him to meet the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.136" offset="9432428">Ms. Smith advised Mrs. Williams about her legal rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.887" offset="10667497">Perhaps, at the outset, we should deal with appellant’s argument that the disciplinary rules in this case are overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.410" offset="10713577">Of course, we contend that the activities on this record were not protected by the First Amendment, but even if the Court should find the solicitation by attorneys has afforded some protection under First Amendment, we would submit to the Court that such would be commercial expression to which the over-breadth doctrine applies weakly at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.453" offset="10809708">As the Court noted in Bates v. State of Arizona, commercial expression is not likely to be crushed by such restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.393" offset="10857460">We would urge to the Court not to apply over-breadth to the case of solicitation by attorneys as they decline to apply it to professional advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.004" offset="10915974">The litigation which appellant sought to promote in this case was an action for, as she expressed it, money against Mrs. Williams’ private physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.816" offset="10959128">We maintain that this was private litigation which the Court in Button clearly recognized as being traditionally condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.561" offset="10998207">I would point out that, last week, this Court considered another sterilization case in Stump versus Barton in which a daughter had been sterilized at the request of her natural mother and sole parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.536" offset="11050034">Regardless of whether one considers the mother’s actions in that case to be right or wrong, it occurs to me that if we accept the appellant’s argument that an attorney has the right to persuade or induce potential client to file a suit, then an attorney in that case could of course persuade or induce the daughter to file a suit against the mother.</text>

            <text syncTime="2900.002" offset="11679899">If you look at the letter, this was not what she told Mrs. Williams.</text>

            <text syncTime="2928.262" offset="11792957">I feel that the letter of August 30th was clearly an inducement to Mrs. Williams with the prospect of receiving money to allow the American Civil Liberties Union to file a suit for her.</text>

            <text syncTime="3593.658" offset="14454521">At this point, I think I would like to make some brief summary marks and close my argument and I would like to urge the Court to consider in the facts of this case that the perspective client, Mrs. Williams, had been advised prior to the August letter from appellant Smith of her legal rights and remedies and availability of the ACLU to represent her.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.388" offset="14577505">Appellant Smith, in her testimony before the Grievance Committee, testified that in her letter she was seeking members of the plaintiff class so that the American Civil Liberties Union could have clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.143" offset="14632467">I would submit that the First Amendment was not intended to protect or afford the attorney a right to secure the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.051" offset="14668098">We would respectfully request that this Court consider these facts and affirm the decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.056" offset="14708117">Thank you.</text>
