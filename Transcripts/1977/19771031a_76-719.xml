            <text syncTime="54.176" offset="296584">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.757" offset="311004">This case is here on certiorari to the District of Columbia Circuit which denied enforcement of the board's order directed to respondent union local of the iron workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.180" offset="360637">The case involves the relationship between two provisions that were added to the National Labor Relations Act in 1959, Section 8(f) which permits employers and unions in the building and construction industry to enter into agreements before employee has s been hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.140" offset="436496">So called pre-hire agreements and Section 8(b)(7)(C) which regulates recognitional and organizational picketing via Labor Organization and in general terms the question presented is whether a pre-hire agreement entered into a pursuant Section 8 (f) privileges recognitional picketing via minority union which would otherwise violate Section 8 (b)(7)(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="117.159" offset="548509">Now, the facts are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.690" offset="558645">In May of 73, Higdon Construction Company executed a contract with Glenmore Distilleries to erect the facility in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.332" offset="605247">The contract required Higdon to use union labor in an order to obtain iron workers from respondent union.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.991" offset="639938">It was required to sign an acceptance to the areawide labor agreement which the union had entered into with a multi-employer association.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.797" offset="683092">The agreement purported to cover all the employees who performed iron work for signatory employers within the union's territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.262" offset="740979">It contained no provision requiring employees hired by the employer to become union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.999" offset="767938">Union Security Clause, no provision requiring the employer to check off union dooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.966" offset="795837">Higdon Construction performed the Glenmore job with some of its own employees who were nonunion and with some employees who were supplied by the union.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="243.297" offset="1053090">By the employer you mean.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="244.357" stopTime="907.605">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="244.357" offset="1057375">By the employer, in that situation the board would treat it like an ordinary collected bargaining agreement which carries with it a presumption that the union has majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.082" offset="1124248">The board found and the Court of Appeals accepted that finding, that neither at the time the labor agreement was executed, nor thereafter the union claim to or in fact represent a majority of Higdon Constructions employees at the Glenmore project.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.411" offset="1193525">Meanwhile, Higdon Contracting was formed, to perform nonunion iron jobs and it did successfully on two jobs, Grace and Warmet(ph) and began work on them with nonunion labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.629" offset="1254442">When Higdon refused to apply the prior agreement to these jobs, the union picketed the jobs which signed stating that Higdon Construction was in the violation of the previous pre-hire agreement was entered into at the Glenmoore job.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.604" offset="1314315">Higdon Contracting filed an 8 (b)(7) charge and the board found that the violation of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.406" offset="1357574">It preliminarily found that the agreement between the union and Higdon, although it was a pre-hire agreement sanctioned by 8(f) did not privilege the picketing at the Grace job site as a means of enforcing that agreement because there was no showing that the union had ever acquired a majority under the agreement to form a full collective bargaining relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.653" offset="1490589">The board in so holding relied on its earlier decision in R.J. Smith holding that a pre-hire agreement without proof that the union had acquired a majority support there under did not carry with it presumption that the union had become the Section 9 (a) or majority representative of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.271" offset="1580973">Court of Appeals which it set aside the board's decision in R.J. Smith, also set aside its decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.181" offset="1616604">Now, it is a established principle under the National Labor Relations Act that employee shall be free to select their own bargaining representative, that an employer is obligated to bargain under Section 8(a)(5) of the Act only with the representative designated by a majority of the employees in a appropriate unit and that it is an unfair labor practice for both under part of the employer and the union to enter into a collective bargaining agreement when the union does not represent a majority of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.501" offset="1781907">Even though the parties may in good faith belief that they do and even though subsequently the union may in fact acquire a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.292" offset="1817120">Now, Section 8(b)(7)(c) provides significant additional protection or the employees' rights of free choice by prohibiting a union which is not currently certified as a bargaining representative of the employees from picketing to force the employer, to recognize it as the employees representative for more than 30 days unless a representation petition is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.058" offset="1924117">If a timely petition is filed, then a provision is made for an expedited election and the whole theory of 8 (b)(7)(c) is to channel disputes concerning the representation status of the union from the picket line into the board's representation procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.940" offset="2007709">The union's picketing here came squarely within 8 (b)(7)(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="486.449" offset="2025681">It had never been certified by the board as the representative of Higdon's employees, nor had it otherwise been selected by a majority of those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.470" offset="2065806">Nevertheless the union picketed here for more than 30 days during which time no representation petition was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.418" offset="2105616">The evolved purpose of the picketing was to compel Higdon to adhere to the pre-hire agreement executed for the Glenmore job, the necessary effect of which would have been to recognize the union as the representative of the employees at the Grace job site even though they had never selected the union as their representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.809" offset="2195164">Now, the basic question that we come down to here is whether the 8 (f) agreement removes the picketing from the reach of 8 (b)(7)(c) on the theory that such agreement by operation of law has established the union as the Section 9 (a) or majority representative of Higdon's employees and thus the representation question is already been resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.855" offset="2307386">In the board's view, and 8 (f) agreement does not without more establish that the union is the majority representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.271" offset="2348973">It is merely a preliminarily step that contemplates further action to establish a full bargaining relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.395" offset="2385544">Hence, absent to showing that the union has required such majority support, neither the agreement is enforceable, neither through a bargaining order issued under Section 8 (a)(5) which obligates the imperative bargain with the majority representative, nor does it insulate the picketing from 8 (b)(7)(c) picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.731" offset="2490870">Now, the board's position rests upon the following considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.246" offset="2508947">In the first place, we start with the language of the statute which is set forth at page three of the board's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.375" offset="2549384">It provides that it shall not be an unfair labor practice for employers or unions in the construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged or who upon their employment will be engaged in that industry because the majority status of such labor organization has not been established under the provisions of Section 9, prior to the making of such agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.344" offset="2657322">Now, nothing in that language suggests that it was intended to confer upon a union that is a party to a pre-hire agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.003" offset="2691908">The status of a Section 9 (a) or majority representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.413" offset="2709567">Congress did not in Section 8 (f) or elsewhere modify Sections 8 (a)(5) or 9 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="665.647" offset="2742481">The former as I have indicated obligates the employer to bargain with the representative of his employees subject to the provisions of 9 (a) and 9 (a) defines the bargaining representative as the representative selected by the majority of the employees in an appropriate unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.280" offset="2817087">Moreover, while the board's well established contract bar rules would preclude the board from entertaining a representation petition during the life of a collective – an ordinary collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.550" offset="2886155">The last proviso of the Section 8 (f) which is on page four of the brief provides that any agreement which would be invalid but for clause one which permits without the majority being established, shall not be a bar to a petition filed pursuant to Section 9 (c) which is a the provision that for determining a representation questions or 9 (e) which is a provision that permits employees to de-authorize a union security clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.945" offset="3031709">Now, the legislative history, we believe confirms that Congress in authorizing pre-hire agreements intended to do nothing more, because of the peculiar characteristics of the building and construction industry to relieve them from what would otherwise be a clear violation of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.286" offset="3181025">I have mentioned earlier that --and this court so held in the Garment Workers case a number of years ago, that in the ordinary case, an employer and a union have to have a representative complement of employees on board and the union has to represent a majority of them before you can enter into a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.866" offset="3299412">This did not work for the building and construction industry because of the short term nature of most construction projects, and the fact that the employers ordinarily lacked a steady complement of employees, is necessary for employers to enter into labor agreements before the job is started or the workers are hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.457" offset="3413724">So, 8 (f) was enacted to relieve them of having to comply with what would otherwise be an impossible rule for the building and construction industry and it caused a lot of trouble under the Taft-Hartley Act in administering because it just did not fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.197" offset="3516751">But we submit that that is as far as Congress intended to go, it did not intend to relieve unions of the responsibility of acquiring a majority support under these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.124" offset="3580385">Congress thought that in the typical case that would happen because the employer would draw from a pool of skilled craftsmen in the area who are usually are often union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.728" offset="3638795">Secondly, it permitted the negotiation of union security provisions which gave employees seven days instead of the normal 30, to join the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.283" offset="3721028">If I understand you are saying that the 8 (f) removed the legal rule that would be an unfair labor practice for the union to enter into such an agreement, but it did not have the effect of making the union, the collective bargaining agent of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.157" offset="3800545">What is the net result of this, the creation of a valid enforceable contract or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="935.180" offset="3820607">I gather you are saying it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.196" offset="3836699">If not, how would it under – let me get the whole thought out, how then would they determine whether the employees could insist on being paid the wage rates specified in the agreement, for example, or bonuses at the end of these – were these enforcement obligations or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="968.910" offset="3955608">No, my assumption would be that the union never gets the majority status, but toward the end of the contract terms, it is – when they finish the building, the company just decides well, we have decided not to pay you that amount, we think we agreed to pay more than we should have, it is not an enforceable contract, we will give you the reasonable value of your services and that is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.084" offset="4024258">Will they be free to do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.653" offset="7078495">Now if congress had wanted the union to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.354" offset="7089361">If congress had intended that an 8 (f) contract is valid only when the union establishes its majority would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.813" offset="7123216">The Act is silent on that, further more, the Legislative History that they speak about was mentioned by the Court of Appeals four years ago on the local 150 case, when they said we confine no sanction in the language, history or policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.069" offset="7188209">History meaning Legislative History or section 8 (f) to permit an employer to abrogate unilaterally validly executed pre-hire agreement, or to permit an employer to commit one of these otherwise an unfair labor practice, even though at that time the union has not obtained majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.147" offset="7272532">Now the question is suggested in the Board's briefs that what about the employees wishes in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.404" offset="7301580">Well that proviso takes care of that because the proviso says that unlike a normal contract where you can have an election because of the contract bar at any time, at any time after an 8 (f) contract is signed, the employees if they feel the union is not representing and they do not want the union, the employer, if he feels that this is not a union which represents a majority of these employees or any other union can come in and get an election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.854" offset="7807311">The practice of signing of such agreements for future employment is not entirely consistent with Wager Act's ruling and then they said that exclusive contracts can lawfully be concluded only if the lot of people have signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.826" offset="7863213">He said this is the reason why it has to be different in the construction industry. One is that the employer has to know his labor costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.733" offset="7890903">Two, he has to have available a supply of skilled craftsmen and, therefore the history shows that the purpose of an 8 (f) contract is to legitimatize the practice of a union and an employer signing a contract for three years as done in this case and is not throughout the contract two or three years or one year to assure a supply of skilled craftsmen to give stability in the industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.495" offset="9589907">How do you get around just the literal language of 8 (b)(7), why does not the language apply to your situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2410.650" offset="9722504">We cite at page 11 of our brief the Dallas case and I quote from the Court of Appeals language there in 1968 that the Board itself there, the Board correctly points out that section 8 (b)(7)(A) is aimed only at a labor organizations picketing to gain recognition for the first time, not picketing designed to retain its representative status.</text>

            <text syncTime="2466.560" offset="9946217">If your argument is valid would it not equally be valid even if the contract is invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.209" offset="10036810">It is a very sharp question Mr. Justice Stevens and I not sure to answer that because it would appear to me in the first place that it could be argued that once the employer breaches the contract and it is no longer controlling there is a termination of the recognition of the union and of the union then pickets, if the contract is invalid the union is then picketing to get recognitional status for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.489" offset="10161884">If the contract is invalid, the union was recognize because the union could not be recognized by a contract unless it is a valid contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.727" offset="10198873">So therefore, I would say that the validity of the contract is controlling in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.946" offset="10227713">But I have not thought that through, that is my initial reactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.903" offset="10291556">So therefore my point there is that the Board's interpretation encourages employers to discriminate against union members to make people drop union membership as a condition of employment in order to prevent the union from getting a majority status and thereby saying we can avoid binding effect of a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.607" offset="13706387">He can either do that by filing a petition under Section 9 of the Act which is explicit or he take his chances in an unfair labor practice proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.225" offset="14064787">Your Honor, I think that what has happened is that there are several different parts of the Building and Construction Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.204" offset="14112748">There is residential construction where as I understand it, it is not uncommon to use nonunion labor because they can not complete by using union labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.156" offset="14160499">In big construction, commercial construction that is more unionized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.619" offset="14190384">As a result of that you have had the practice of these double-breasted corporations being set up in the Building and Construction Industry where they operate union on the big jobs and nonunion on the small jobs and this is really the problem in this case and there is nothing unlawful under the Act in setting up these different methods.</text>

            <text syncTime="3564.085" offset="14336251">I do not know the answer to that Your Honor because as I pointed out Mr. Justice Stewart, the typical case is not this one.</text>
