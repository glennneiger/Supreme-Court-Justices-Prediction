            <text syncTime="30.476" offset="201806">As the Court knows this case involves the broad question of the transfer of a penal complex inmate to a state mental hospital we are now and encompassed probably within that question is the constitutionality of Nebraska statute, which provides generally that upon a finding by physician or psychologist appointed by the Director of Corrections that an inmate has a mental defect or suffering from mental defect that he may and it also the opinion of this physician or psychologist that he cannot be properly treated in a penal institution which is in there, the director may transfer him to a state mental hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.243" offset="420921">It also provides and I think one of the things the lower court overlooked was that the transfer is for examination, study and treatment and the state mental hospital has the duty to send the inmate back when treatment is no longer necessary.</text>
