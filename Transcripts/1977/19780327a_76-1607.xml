            <text syncTime="26.325" offset="185195">For 33 years the Securities and Exchange Commission has filed the practice of issuing consecutive but separate orders of ten days duration, suspending trading and security when necessary to provide immediate protection for the investing public against fraud, manipulation and inadequate corporate disclosures, and the Commission has done so only after making a separate and fresh review of the then current facts in each situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.684" offset="306612">The Court of Appeals, however in this case, has enjoined the Commission from ever again suspending trading and security for more than ten consecutive days, despite the Commission’s longstanding and consistent administrative practice, express congressional approval of that practice and reenactment and expansion of the Commission’s authority in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.982" offset="399817">Although the Commission recognizes that it may not exercise its summary suspension power, for an indefinite period of time, what we respectfully seek from this Court is the restoration of the full measure of statutory authority, we believe, the Congress intended to confirm.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.156" offset="608588">Of course the Court of Appeals in this case never reached the question of an abusive discretion, and the facts in context in this case do not suggest that there was necessarily an abusive discretion with respect to that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.003" offset="659892">That is an issue that could be tested, had this case been heard timely which is one of the issues that Court has asked me to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.788" offset="691030">I do think that at some point a trading suspension can constitute an abusive discretion and certainly in a case 36 consecutive suspensions might constitute an abusive discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.085" offset="820284">I think that there are degrees of concern that the Commission would have had with respect to the suspensions at varying points in time and that a court, if the matter was properly presented to it, could differentiate between the factual circumstances that existed anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.701" offset="886740">Bear in mind, I think that the Commission does have a large measure of discretion in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.787" offset="907115">Its focus is to protect trading and the public investors who trade in these securities and in this particular case, there was an alleged market manipulation which in fact the Commission ultimately concluded had existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.174" offset="956643">But supposing that review was sought after the second consecutive ten days suspension, and the Court concludes no abusive discretion, there are then 18 more successive ten days suspensions and review was again sought in the Court, would the same court be justified and concluding that there was an abusive discretion simply by the number of successive suspensions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey L. Pitt</label>
            <text syncTime="245.063" offset="1060193">I do not believe that the mere number of suspensions per se would give rise to an abusive discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.055" offset="1088092">I think it is hard to fashion that kind of a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.828" offset="1099272">I think in any given factual context the continued duration of these suspensions may constitute an abusive discretion, but I do not think a court can simply say, because consistent for 18 consecutive periods that, that was an abusive discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.534" offset="1158100">Take for example, the situation where there is rapid manipulation ongoing and the Commission is trying to get to the bottom of that manipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.477" offset="1193835">It is having difficulty nailing down the evidence, finding out whether the manipulation existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.050" offset="1216092">It might take 180 days to put that case together, go into court, obtain an injunction and prevent the manipulators from reeking the habit that they might be perpetrating in the markets.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.374" offset="1337404">No, my hypothesis is that the Commission, having sufficient cause to believe that there is a possibility of manipulation and not having enough evidence yet to go into Court, can suspend trading.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.352" offset="1453283">I could not say to the Court that it should take the Commission 30 days or 40 days, or 50 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.821" offset="1475226">I can say that a court can look at the type of case and determine whether an investigation has bought down, it is not being pursued diligently, or there are explanations as to why a matter is taking as long as it is, and I think that the Commission has an obligation to be sensitive to the fact that a suspension of trading can cause some problems for investors and should be terminated as promptly as possible.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="1722.577" offset="6970240">Thank you very much Your honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.163" offset="6976614">Gentleman, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.178" offset="6988630">My name is Sam Sloan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.263" offset="6996990">I believe this is a simple case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.891" offset="7007438">The Section 12 (k) of the Securities Exchange Act gives the SEC the authority to suspend trade in a security for a period not exceeding ten days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.525" offset="7054041">Here the SEC has suspended trading in a security for 370 days, therefore the SEC has filed the statute and the Court of Appeals under the circumstances was rquired to enjoin the SEC from issuing from continuous practice which it has continued over a period of 33 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.221" offset="7144843">Now they say, the case has moot, but the problem that anyone has in objecting to this procedure of the SEC is the problem that I face, because as the SEC has pointed out I started a case back in 1974 protesting the trading suspensions in Canadian Javelin Limited and these suspensions continued and I lost that case then I came back with a petition for review and the Court of Appeals again protesting the trading suspensions of Canadian Javelin Limited and I lost that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.342" offset="7257274">Finally, and the reason I lost the second case was because the SEC said that they were going to an administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.888" offset="7283501">I applied to the SEC for an administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.475" offset="7293845">They waited until they were ready to enter their last trading suspension order, and they did so and at the same time, they denied my request for an administrative hearing, and thus putting me back into the Court of Appeals for the third time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.118" offset="7348389">Now they say because of their delays and because they ran me around for approximately two years prior to getting me back into the Court of Appeals by making a bunch of suggestion, such as the suggestion that they were going to give me administrative hearing, which in fact they did not give that the case has become moot upon expiration of the consecutive ten day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.100" offset="7448281">The last order which was timed to coincide with the denial of my request for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.735" offset="7470851">I do not believe that a government agency can be allowed to put a person in this kind of position where they are controlling the case, where they are deciding at what point I can object to their procedure, and they can then manipulate the facts in such a way to say that case is moot before I have ever had an opportunity to present my claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.238" offset="7564892">Now, they say that the case, the action of the SEC can only be reviewed by a Court in an abusive discretion situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.332" offset="7601254">Well, as the Court is well aware if you file a petition for review in the Court of Appeals -- now I tried to proceed in the District Court, I lost the SEC said my exclusive remedy was to file a petition for review in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.023" offset="7656007">So since they told me what my remedy was, I pursued that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.101" offset="7672307">I filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals, and when I got up there, they, at that point, said that this really was not my remedy, I should go back to the Commission and where they would give me an administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.919" offset="7743569">Now, in the situation where they say a court may review a case on the matter of abusive discretion the question arises.</text>
