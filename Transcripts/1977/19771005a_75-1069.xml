            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80002">We will hear arguments next in 75-1069, Richmond Unified School District against Berg.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.772" offset="263068">Mr. Walenta you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur W. Walenta</label>
            <text syncTime="50.740" offset="282921">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please it court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.370" offset="301416">This is a civil rights action brought by Mrs. Berg a teacher employed by Richmond Unified School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.283" offset="337047">It was brought to prevent the district from placing her on maternity leave and to compel the district to allow her sick leave credit, while absent due to maternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.616" offset="394412">Mrs. Berg was granted a summary judgment in the District Court and that judgment was affirmed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals because this case was decided as a summary judgment and because there is disagreement between the parties as to the import of the evidence that was before the District Court, I would like to review briefly what the evidence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.860" offset="499424">The evidence consisted of pleadings in the case, Mrs. Berg's complaint, an amendment to it, a supplement to it, the answer filed by School district, limited affidavits and exhibits presented by Mrs. Berg and somewhat more extensive affidavits and exhibits provided by the School District and that is all the evidence there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.288" offset="601093">That evidence shows that before December 1972, the School District maintained a compulsory maternity leave regulation requiring teachers to terminate their service at the end of the seventh month of pregnancy and to take maternity leave and the evidence shows that the District had an informal policy disallowing sick leave usage for maternity purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.185" offset="716658">In November of 1972, Mrs. Berg filed a charge with the EEOC challenging these policies, this charge was unsworn, this charge contained the notation that she had, had no correspondence with the School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.165" offset="784577">On December 13th of 1972, the School District Governing Board modified its maternity leave policy to permit individual consideration of request of teachers to work later than the seventh month.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.751" offset="855003">The next day, Mrs. Berg applied for maternity leave in an application that conformed to the policy as it had been modified the preceding day.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.659" offset="898575">On December 20, Mrs. Berg submitted a second application for maternity leave and in that application, she asked permission to continue work until term, until her child was born.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.476" offset="949880">Seven days later the School District replied in a letter to Mrs. Berg, stating that if she was going to work until that date, the District wanted a physical examination by its doctor to be assured of her physical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.825" offset="1011215">There was intervening correspondence from Mrs. Berg's attorney and she filed suit in Federal District Court on February 5th.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.315" offset="1053220">On February 16th taking into account medical advice that the district had obtained in the intervening period, the District Superintendent promogated a more elaborated policy for maternity leave and Mrs. Berg was notified that this revised policy would be applied in her case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.637" offset="1146529">In chronological order on the 21st of February, Mrs. Berg received the notice of her right to sue under Title VII and on the 22nd she received a preliminary injunction from the Federal District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.432" offset="1209641">In March on the 14th she had her child and she worked up until that time and in June she supplemented her complaint in the Federal District Court action to allege her receipt of the statutory notice of her right to sue under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.681" offset="1286650">From the outset, the School District has challenged the jurisdiction of the District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.536" offset="1322072">It is our contention in the first place that her EEOC charge was premature and that it was not a proper charge sufficient to found a Federal District Court action under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.017" offset="1380064">At the time that she filed this charge, the district had taken no action respecting her.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.385" offset="1405455">The policy that she complained of in the charge was modified before the district took any action concerning her and it was not until the 27th of December when a letter was written by the district to Mrs. Berg that there was the first occasion or occurrence as I would call it, between the district and the aggrieved person that I think she could complain about and that was the point which the district indicated that it wanted a medical examination by its physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.158" offset="1532619">When we look to the specific language of the statute, I think we find that Congress intended under that statute that an unlawful practice have occurred before you can file a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.290" offset="1601060">The time periods that are involved in the statute occur “after the alleged, unlawful employment practice occurred.”</text>
            <text syncTime="391.045" offset="1644110">The charge is to be filed by a person claiming to be grieved and that person has to allege in the charge, “that a lawyer has engaged in an unlawful employment practice.”</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="402.242" offset="1688936">Mr. Walenta, you are prejudiced, how?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_w_walenta" startTime="411.491" stopTime="458.695">
            <label>Mr. Arthur W. Walenta</label>
            <text syncTime="411.491" offset="1725925">We are prejudiced for one thing by becoming implicated in a legal proceeding based upon a charge that was hypothetical and speculative when filed and in fact in the situation in which the facts changed between the time the charge was filed and the time any action was taken concerning Mrs. Berg.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.836" offset="1835326">Secondly, I think as a matter of law and as a matter of policy it is Congress that mandated that this EEOC charge be a condition that a person is required to file before they can file suit in District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.092" offset="1908364">They must file suit a certain number of days --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="458.695" offset="1914738">The letter does not bare on prejudice, of course does it?</text>

          <turn speaker="arthur_w_walenta" startTime="461.090" stopTime="461.881">

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="461.881" offset="1927486">You see, the latter does not bare on your prejudice and that --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_w_walenta" startTime="464.150" stopTime="715.987">
            <label>Mr. Arthur W. Walenta</label>
            <text syncTime="464.150" offset="1936577">No that is correct, that is a different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.364" offset="1957370">In any event we find no occurrence between the District and Mrs. Berg until six weeks after this charge was filed we believe that Congress clearly mandated that a charge be filed and that indeed the statutory procedure for charges, for EEOC investigation and for the various time periods that are implicated in the statute cannot be followed, unless one requires that there be a charge that is definite to occurrence and that shows an actual subject of actual grievance, on the part of a complaining party before they can file a Federal Court suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.517" offset="2142004">The further major jurisdictional issue in this case has to do with Mrs. Berg filing suit before she received the statutory notice of her Right to Sue from the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.813" offset="2203235">This court has characterized that notice as a jurisdictional prerequisite in more than one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.297" offset="2237089">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, that by virtue of her obtaining the notice after she filed a suit and by virtue of her supplementing her complaint, she had cured a jurisdictional defect that existed when the suit was filed and in reaching this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit relied upon the Fourth Circuit decision in Henderson against Eastern Freight Ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.723" offset="2354849">We have in our brief, elaborated our quarrel with the Henderson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.152" offset="2380554">Henderson holds that a late notice under Title VII has the effect of validating a complaint that was untimely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.141" offset="2428515">Once to sympathize perhaps with the decision in the Henderson case, but we believe that it is wrong in principle and we believe that there is a very serious issue indeed Without ascertaining when a federal court has jurisdiction and we believe that the proposition that jurisdictional facts can occur to prefect jurisdiction that did not exist when the suit was filed, would leave the courts with rather intolerable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.149" offset="2556515">This Court in 1824 in Mollan against Torrence established a rule that Federal Court Jurisdiction depends upon the facts that the time action is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.511" offset="2610013">This specific ruling was confirmed by an opinion written by Justice Brandeis and we believe that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.761" offset="2638957">It is simple, it is intelligible and we believe that it ought to be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.602" offset="2662363">I have mentioned, that in the absence of following that rule, you raise a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.762" offset="2682947">In which Plaintiffs are entitled to file Federal District Court suits and establish jurisdiction after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.152" offset="2712518">In District Court cases following Henderson and Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.797" offset="2727146">District Court jurisdiction has been found to be established one year and more after this suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.211" offset="2752746">The idea of this being the general rule in the Federal Courts, is one that I find, very difficult to live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.157" offset="2784616">Finally, we contend that this Henderson decision has the practical effect of avoiding all of the requirements that congress mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.064" offset="2820247">With respect to the operation of Title VII and the preliminary operation of an administrative procedure required to resolve complaints before matters get into the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.050" offset="2880120">I would like to bring the courts attention to a decision that has been handed down by the Third Circuit since our reply brief was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.715" offset="2914810">That is Glus against GC Murphy Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.684" offset="2930693">That is a Title VII case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur W. Walenta</label>
            <text syncTime="736.971" offset="3027868">Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.658" offset="3034555">That case was one in which an employer were to file a cross complaint in a Title VII case against the Union that had not been named in the original EEOC chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.887" offset="3091502">And the Third Circuit ruled that Title VII jurisdiction could not be obtained by procedural devices under the federal rules and following Rule 82, the Glus case stands for the position that the Federal rules cannot be used to expand subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.526" offset="3174049">The importance for this case is that Mrs. Berg Supplement was filed under Rule 15(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="784.035" offset="3216054">The other ground upon which the Ninth Circuit found jurisdiction in this case arises in the theory, that Title VII jurisdiction can be perfected before the receipt of a notice of Right to Sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.486" offset="3281883">In order to permit preliminary injunctive relief and in that, the Ninth Circuit followed the theory of Drew against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company a Fifth Circuit Decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.112" offset="3328381">If I understand the Drew case correctly, it holds or agrees in, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.666" offset="3358578">That before the 1972 amendments to Title VII which permitted a preliminary suit by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.872" offset="3395463">There existed by implication, a private cause of action to obtain preliminary relief, without awaiting commission action.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.743" offset="3434960">This cause of action existed, because it was necessary to enforce the rights granted by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.499" offset="3465994">The court in Drew does not sight any authority holding that to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.518" offset="3493997">They simply, apparently expounded and as far as I can tell the proposition in drew, is that there is jurisdiction under Section 1343 to prosecute a Title VII action before you have obtained Title VII jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.128" offset="3576440">That case has been criticized by several District Court opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.287" offset="3597129">We have argued length in our brief that its theory is untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.509" offset="3618026">We believe in particular that the theory in Drew is contrary to this court's decision in National Railroad Passengers Corporation against Passengers Association and the rule of that case is that express statutory provisions for Federal Court jurisdiction are controlling absent clear evidence of a contrary legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.270" offset="3713008">We have found and Mrs. Berg has not found to my knowledge any evidence that Congress intended a broader private cause of action in Title VII cases, then is specifically set forth in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.676" offset="3770686">We believe that the holdings of the Ninth Circuit in this case, of the Fifth Circuit in Drew and in the Fourth Circuit in Henderson conflict with the language of this court in Occidental Life against EEOC and Alexander against Gardner-Denver and in McDonnell Douglas case, that the statutory preconditions to private suit under Title VII are jurisdictional prerequisites.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.169" offset="6876645">It makes a difference with respect to the nature of the injury, that would have been incurred by Mrs. Berg had she been compelled to leave at the time when she was fully able to work for the Richmond School District and teach her kindergartners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.961" offset="6931816">The nature of her injury was such that the District Court as Mr. Justice Stewart has pointed out issued a preliminarily injunction solely on the basis of its jurisdiction over her 1983 claim of an invasion of her constitutional rights by virtue of the force to leave policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.766" offset="7011019">Mrs. Berg in November 1972 was indeed a person claiming to be aggrieved under Title VII for purposes of filling her charge for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.963" offset="7047800">It was her doctor's very best prediction and in the area of pregnancy we deal with predictions, that she would be able to teach until the onset of delivery that is to say and tell the time when the doctor believed she would be confined for purposes of giving birth, for that reason her doctor recommended in a letter to a School District that her state of health was such that she be permitted to continue to teach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.585" offset="7142258">Unlike my opposing counsel statement of the record and I believe page 111 of the Appendix will -- excuse me page 113 of the Appendix will illustrate this, the policy of the district was not to permit teachers as of November of 1972 to teach through their seventh month, but only through there sixth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.964" offset="7219790">That there is little importance to the question of whether the leave was a compulsory one, but in terms of an individual whose income and whose family's livelihood depends upon that person's being able to continue working and where that person's doctor's advice is that, that person is capable of doing so, one month or one week or even one day's loss of employment is actionable and a matter of concern under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.118" offset="7324384">The statement of opposing counsel was that the leave would begin at the end of the seventh month and I share council's confusion about the various policies of this district, with respect to leave dates, for in the course of this litigation the original policy on which Mrs. Berg filed her charge which appears at page 109 of the Appendix was a policy that would have required her, not to work during a period of three months when she was perfectly capable of doing so, reality has demonstrated that fact to us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.061" offset="7732208">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in this case there is a local rule which requires a party making a motion for summary judgment to reside undisputed facts and I believe its page is 101 and 102 of our Appendix, those facts which we believed to be undisputed and to be necessary to the District Court's determination of the illegality of this policy are set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.080" offset="7824263">I wish to call this court's attention to the fact that the submissions of the petitioners in this case, which I believe appear at yes pages 105 through 107.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.283" offset="7877031">Do not dispute the following facts which are critical to the understanding of the discriminatory nature of this policy, First, that disabilities arising from pregnancy are the only disabilities excluded from the payment of accumulated sick leave pay, that is second, no other class of persons who can be predicted to be disabled are subjected to a classificatory doubt of their doctor's advise and assumption and I would say presumption will come to a floor, I believe that those individuals in their ninth month are incompetent, incapable of teaching, awkward, incapable indeed in the words of Dr. Seebott (ph) of even controlling their urinary functions, that in short these pregnant women in there ninth month, all of them , mind you, can be excluded from employment by the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.450" offset="8089772">Now in short the basic facts in this case, with respect to the discriminatory purpose an effect of the Richmond School District's policies taken as a whole are not in dispute before this court nor I believe in terms of this court's determinations in General Electric Company versus Gilbert are the legal implications of this designedly discriminatory policy, a matter of legitimate dispute, let me explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.791" offset="8211084">First of all we submit that Mrs. Berg in light of her doctor's advise, her bread winner status, her ability to continue teaching and her understanding of the Richmond School District's policies as demonstrated in her charge are illustrative of rational conduct on the part of an employee capable of working, who is subject to a mandatory leave policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.237" offset="8304916">She faced the policy which at the time she filed her charge presumed her incapable in her seventh, eighth and ninth month and by the time we got to the stage of the preliminary injunction, the Richmond School District would have done the following things to her with respect to the District Court's determination on the injunction, if it were not enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.538" offset="8382134">First, despite her own doctor's advise she would be compelled to see a District physician, second, the District physician whose opinion has been presented to this court at page 56 had his mind made up with respect to all of these cases, all teachers in there ninth month.</text>
