            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">We'll hear arguments first this morning in 77-10, Exxon Corporation against the Governor of Maryland and the related and consolidated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.990" offset="51931">Mr. Simon you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="16.902" offset="67605">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.727" offset="82860">Appellants challenge the constitutionality of the paragraphs B and C of Chapter 854 of the Maryland Statutes to which I would devote 20 minute and paragraph D of the same statute to which I would devote 10 minutes under the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.231" offset="180872">Paragraph B of the Maryland Act provides that after July 1, 1974, no producer or refiner may open a new service station in Maryland operated by company employees and paragraph C provides that after July 1, 1975, no producer or refiner may operate an existing service station by company employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.441" offset="325695">As of July 1, 1974 only 6%, 233 out of 3800 of the service stations in Maryland were company operated and only 197 of those by refiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.121" offset="396434">No crude oil has ever been produced in Maryland and it is unlikely that any ever will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.425" offset="425691">There is no refinery in Maryland and the state's ecology procedures are such that it is unlikely that there will be any refinery in Maryland at least in this century.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.482" offset="473861">And thus all gasoline sold in Maryland is imported into the state in interstate commerce and all refiner marketers in Maryland are out of state firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.330" offset="525270">To make the purpose of paragraphs B and C crystal clear, in 1975 the legislature enacted an amendment to the statute which expressly provided that all service stations must be operated by dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.160" offset="592562">The statute's legislative history, the proceedings in the State Courts and the briefs in this Court, all make crystal clear that the purpose of the statute is to insulate major brand dealers from the competition of more aggressive lower priced merchants and to ensure that Maryland motorists and those who travel into the state will not receive the benefits of service stations that are company operated and are price cutters who sell at lower prices and do eliminate that competition from the service station business in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.866" offset="783464">The two alleged purposes which the Maryland Court of Appeals gave to sustain the validity of the statute are first that it will prevent monopoly, although they concede that this service station business is highly competitive and many Maryland as well as Federal Laws already prohibit monopolies in any line of commerce and secondly that the statute would permit the fair and equitable rationing of gasoline in the event of emergencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.212" offset="916793">Although paragraph F of this very act so provides and in 1973 the Congress passed the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act under which the federal government from that day to this has allocated gasoline supplies to service stations.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="253.779" offset="1015014">Yes Mr. Justice Rehnquist and as will point out later, the number of service stations of any kind and all kinds whether or not this act prevails will continue to decline because the economics of high prices in gasoline going from the $0.20, $0.25 range of the 50s to the $0.60 and $0.65 range of current prices makes it essential that we have high volume stations that can operate more economically and not have the inefficient marginal stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.778" offset="1171017">So there will be a diminution of stations no matter what.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_simon" startTime="319.431" stopTime="412.093">
            <label>Mr. William Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="319.431" offset="1277701">Well as I understand the decisions of this Court, a statute which burdens interstate commerce will be sustained only if the local benefits are so persuasive and so important as to override the restraint on interstate commerce which they impose and we submit that this mere matter of fair allocation which is already being done by the federal government and preventing monopoly which is already prevented by many statutes does not justify the restraint on completion which this statute imposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.776" offset="1435063">And may I add Mr. Justice Rehnquist I don't suggest for one instant that there will ever come a time when independent major brand service station dealers will go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.974" offset="1491801">The fact is there are many people, I might add including me, who would rather pay a higher price for the extra service and the personal attention you get in a conventional major brand station.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.965" offset="1547807">But there are also a lot of people who would rather forgo those services and go into a low price no service station and pump their own gas and save as much as $0.8 a gallon and what we advocate is that free competition should prevail, let the motorist make the choice and the mix of how many of each there will be will be decided by how many people want to go to each type of station.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.277" offset="2009025">The undisputed testimony below was that those stations can't operate unless the management can control not only the operations of the station but the price because price is their key factor and those Ashland stations under those brand names --</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.469" offset="8289802">Well, I think Mr. Justice Blackmun we have exactly the problem that was in Perez where the Bankruptcy Act said that if you go through -- you're discharged in bankruptcy, you don't owe anybody any money anymore, and the State of Arizona passed a law which says if you have a judgment against you for negligence in operation of an automobile, you may not get a driver's license till you pay that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.581" offset="8406309">And this Court held in Perez that the Arizona Law was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Federal Bankruptcy Law that said once you gone through bankruptcy, you didn't owe the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.359" offset="8461375">The same thing is true in the Rath Packing case decided just this last term by this Court where California passed a statute saying that packaged meats had to be measured by their weight at the place where they were sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.749" offset="8526994">And federal law said packaged meats had to be measured by their weight at the place where they were packed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.202" offset="8552803">And of course depending on the moisture of the climate, the meat will either gain weight or lose weight after it leaves the factory and the California Law was held invalid because it conflicted with the Federal Law and one could not comply with the Federal Law and the State Law at the same time.</text>
