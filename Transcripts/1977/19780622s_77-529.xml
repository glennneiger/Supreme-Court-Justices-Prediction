            <text syncTime="11.006" offset="123967">In this case, the District Court approved a reapportion plan for the City Council of Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.268" offset="156986">The plan included, both single and multi member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.399" offset="177570">Court of Appeals disapproved the plan because in its view the plan should have been considered as judicial rather than a legislative plan and subject to the rule applicable judicial plans that only single member districts should be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.860" offset="275373">The case came here and six of us think the Court of Appeals was wrong and reverse the judgment, but we hardly speak with one voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.875" offset="327409">The reasons for reversal maybe gleaned from an opinion that I have filed, joined by Mr. Justice Stewart, from the opinion filed by Mr. Justice Powell joined by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Rehnquist and an interesting sidelight maybe read in Mr. Justice Rehnquist's opinion, joined by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Powell explaining what we have not decided in the case and we have however, only a single dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.029" offset="480068">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed the dissenting opinion and Justices Brennan and Stevens are with him on that opinion.</text>
