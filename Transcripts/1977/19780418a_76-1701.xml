            <text syncTime="9.560" offset="118112">Your Honor and may it please it the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.472" offset="133785">I appear on behalf of the government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.187" offset="148623">My colleague, Mr. Daniel Freidman is here with me, as does Mr. Herbert S. Sanger, Jr. who is a general counsel to the TVA.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.501" offset="197942">In this unusual case, as Attorney General, I agree that the Secretary of Interior could take a position opposite our position in this court and I have included -- I have stated his position in writing as an Appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.801" offset="263144">I understood that this is not violating any policy of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.179" offset="276623">Historically going back into the Eisenhower Administration, on -- on a rare occasion, this has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.981" offset="303895">I am, of course, not arguing the Secretary of Interior’s position, but it is well-stated in our note to Court, the court will take note of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.872" offset="343392">Now, this case presents a conflict between the snail darter, an endangered specie under the Endangered Species Act and the Tellico Dam Project which is part of the TVA system.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.422" offset="413609">Tellico Dam Project is just not a project, it is a multipurpose project designed to create an amicable body of water, lake to power, industrial development, flood control, and recreation on the Little Tennessee River.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.673" offset="502634">The Little Tennessee River had its origins in the mountain, mountains of North Georgia, flows in the northwest direction generally, in the Knoxville Tennessee area and finally into the Tennessee River, and meets the dams in the TVA system or the Tennessee River.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.347" offset="585286">There are 12 dams on the Little Tennessee River already.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.943" offset="599705">There is not a dam in the last 34 miles of the Little Tennessee before it reaches Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.881" offset="639411">So you have got 34 miles of open free-flowing stream now.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.881" offset="667415">The dam in question, Tellico, is located at the confluent to the Little Tennessee and Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.728" offset="698866">It will impound a body of water, rather large at the point of the dam, bagging up the river for the 31 of the 34 miles to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.058" offset="764172">It will not -- that dam itself will not generate electrical power, but this dam, Tellico would then there, the Fort Loudon Dam on the Tennessee, near the canal connection, some 850-Feet where this extra water will be impounded on the Tennessee, little Tennessee will go over into the Fort Loudon impoundment and there it will be used to generate electricity in the Fort Loudon generating plant and will generate enough electricity to supply roughly 20,000 homes.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.301" offset="961135">I think it will help if I give a brief chronology of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.820" offset="1003245">It was authorized by Congress in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.156" offset="1020590">Construction began in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.663" offset="1038562">In 1972, there was a lawsuit commenced based on the fact that they had not filed an environmental statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.450" offset="1081717">That litigation went on for about a year-and-a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.804" offset="1095091">It went to the District Court, Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals twice and finally TVA prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.807" offset="1123199">They commenced working again on the dam and on the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.604" offset="1186311">The snail darter is a darter of the perch family.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.602" offset="1202298">There are 130 known varieties of darters.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.481" offset="1221837">There are 85-90 in Tennessee alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.333" offset="1241273">There are 11 in the Little Tennessee River.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.351" offset="1257364">There had been 8-10 darters discovered in this last five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.814" offset="1275127">It is known as a snail darter because it eats fresh water snail which are found on the bottom of the Little Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.754" offset="1310967">I have in my hand a darter, a snail darter, it was Exhibit 7 in the case when it was tried and we brought it with us so that you can see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.802" offset="1355166">It is 3 inches.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.728" offset="2334863">So, it is not enough to just leave it or hold if you have to do something to the dam to take part of it out to restore the natural habitat.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.656" offset="2386585">In the chronology, they were various things said in the Congress which I will mention in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.607" offset="2414380">The issue presented is all the construction of the Endangered Species Act Section 7, the District Court wanted to buy it on the balance of equities, taking the position that it was not to be applied completely retroactively that you ought to consider the stage of development of project.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.964" offset="2511764">The Sixth Circuit said because there was no other way to preserve the habitat, much less the darter, that they had to give literal effect to the statute and enjoin the project no matter what stage of completion.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.860" offset="2583340">The statute itself is set out on page 2 of my brief and the critical language is number one; shall consult, but then says that the agency, that would be the TVA here, in carrying out programs refers to taking such action, the agency must take such action necessary to ensure that actions authorized, this was the key language, funded or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence of such endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.571" offset="2762226">Now, our argument is that by the way that -- the language of the statute itself can be construed to support the District Court and allow this dam to be completed and operated and in the end they have cited other things that I will argue to support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.473" offset="2853864">The District Court used a hypothetical which draws -- really draws the better than anything I found in a whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.608" offset="2894301">The District Court said if the plaintiff’s argument were take into its logical extreme, that will require court to hold impoundment of water behind a fully completed dam if an endangered specie was discovered in the river on the day before the impoundment was scheduled to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.991" offset="2979878">The District Court said that would be too extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.729" offset="2994820">The Circuit Court said “we disagree.”</text>
            <text syncTime="731.772" offset="3007046">That is what the Act means.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.261" offset="3016972">You would have to shut down the dam the day before.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.086" offset="3036303">We say that that is so extreme that it would prohibit an agency from maintaining a facility that was found to threaten a habitat of a newly discovered endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.908" offset="3091578">We not only say that by way of argument, the Secretary has put it in his regulations, 50 CFR 402.03, just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.561" offset="3130135">That Section 7 applies to all activities where a federal control or involvement remains, which in itself could jeopardize an endangered specie or critical habitat.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.423" offset="3181648">So that is the issue that is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.302" offset="3197113">It is the issue that must be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.846" offset="3207353">Can there be a balance in the equitable factors in deciding whether this action taken in the meaning of the statute can be taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="819.529" offset="3358027">If you give carried out the same meaning on a para material basis as authorized or funded, it would read then that the agency had to have choices.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.502" offset="3417900">Now, ordinarily there are choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.951" offset="3427722">Here, there were none.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.965" offset="3431797">It was one or the other as justices at both courts saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.342" offset="3449246">The two cases where there were choices was Sandhill Crane case in the Fifth Circuit where the choice and option and alternative available to the Director of Transportation was simply to move another change and save the Sandhill Crane.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.598" offset="3526360">Now, that is the National Wildlife Federation versus Coleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.615" offset="3554363">The other case was the Indiana Bat case which was in the Eight Circuit and there the -- and I got into this thinking what is the scheme of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.252" offset="3596891">The Secretary admits in his regulations that the Coleman holds as does this Eighth Circuit case Sierra Club versus Froehike that the Secretary of Interior does not have the veto power, but the Act also allows a suit by a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.698" offset="3662719">So, the citizen can go in court and get the court to veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.560" offset="3678184">That is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.482" offset="3681841">They said you cannot use this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.418" offset="3693544">So, I started looking and try and find the scheme of the statute because somebody has got to face it somewhere along the line and it seems to me the Eight Circuit in Sierra Club versus Froehike had it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.361" offset="3737325">That -- that -- that case in -- they said that this impoundment behind this dam would fill caves with water and destroy the Indiana bat.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.304" offset="3781106">There were some facts showing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.465" offset="3785808">There were a lot of bats in different parts of the country</text>
            <text syncTime="929.386" offset="3797511">Not all the bats in this area -- within Missouri would be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.702" offset="3814752">The court said the way to approach this is, first, have in mind that the Secretary of Interior does not have a veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.421" offset="3849651">All the duty on the acting agencies is to consult.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.472" offset="3869818">Consider all the alternatives and then retest it and that is reviewable in court, and retest it on an abusive discretion, was it an abusive discretion?</text>

            <text syncTime="961.635" offset="3926451">He said this dam is finished for all intents and purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="971.960" offset="3967725">We do not think that the statute was intended to be applied retroactively, at least it was a presumption that it should not be applied retroactively, taking all these things into consideration, I hold that the dam can be used and the project move forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.084" offset="4348277">This is on -- on a footnote on page 28 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.145" offset="4364473">The effective agency must decide whether the degree of completion and extent of public funding of a particular project to justify an action that may be otherwise inconsistent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.816" offset="4503235">The next argument, first is, you can read this language itself as a line that the District Court result and is avoiding the highest result of the Circuit Court.</text>
