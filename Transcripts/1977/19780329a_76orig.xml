            <text syncTime="17.096" offset="148317">I should like to begin by identifying four of the factors which prompted California to invoke this Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.326" offset="177261">For these same considerations in our judgment make the exercise of that jurisdiction appropriate and indeed imperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.974" offset="203801">The first jurisdiction, first consideration was the technical basis for jurisdiction under Texas versus Florida, point of which of course I will be elaborating upon throughout this argument and namely that the tax claims which have been asserted by various taxing entities exceed the available assets of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.552" offset="278094">For the moment, suffice it to say that once we determined that this was a situation in which the tax claims did have that quality, we had a very practical and real concern that if California were successful in its own Courts, the judgment it came might not be as collectible.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.569" offset="1098234">I think it that there is really no realistic possibility and Texas does not contend that the values are less and there is really no realistic possibility that the values would be such that lower rates of tax would apply, so we are in a situation in which I think it is safe to say that the tax rates combine to a 101% and that problem is exacerbated by a couple of factors that are mentioned in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.626" offset="1202410">One, that some of the items which are expenditures by the estate, for example, for litigation expenses which are lawful figure are not deductible under California Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.667" offset="1246610">As a result although they are losing the money in the form of these expenses, it does not reduce their California taxes and that again only exacerbates the short fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.624" offset="1282450">The second problem is that has Summa has encountered really staggering law suits in the year since Mr. Hughes died.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.552" offset="1314110">It was $29million of operating losses in 1976, and I think the figure was a 169 million if I recall correctly of reduction of net book values in that same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.837" offset="1363325">1977 is not formalized, we have been advised informally that the figure would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $15million.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.261" offset="1633013">Well, Mr. Chief Justice in my view it would not, but I think under Texas V. Florida the 100% mark has special significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.913" offset="1667599">I do not think I have to persuade you of my alternative view but I might in response to your question suggest you briefly what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.350" offset="1701349">It starts with Massachusetts v. Missouri, 308 U.S. where the Court refused to entertain a suit to prevent Missouri from imposing a tax on a trust that had been established by Massachusetts domiciliary with Missouri trusties.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.248" offset="1768954">The Court distinguished Texas v. Florida in that case, but on grounds which to me suggest that the 100% figure is not the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.010" offset="1803958">After noting that the trust assets of the Missouri Trust were sufficient to pay the taxes of both States, the Court went on to say and I am going to quote from it, “It was not shown that the tax claims of the two States are mutually exclusive” and that to the contrary again quoting, “The validity of each claim is wholly independent of that of the other” under which, there was not a central issue domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.647" offset="1890476">From this, we think that there is jurisdiction of a suit between States in this area, where two things are shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.426" offset="1913672">First, that two or more States each seek to levy a tax on a mutually exclusive ground as there was in Texas v. Florida and as there is here, domicile; and secondly that the claim of the defendant State in some concrete way, in some real way, injures the plaintiff state.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.577" offset="1974277">Now in Texas v. Florida that second element of concrete injury was shown by the fact that the tax claims exceeded a 100% and so you had a classic in the nature of interpleader situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.681" offset="2018685">Even if that were not here, we believe that our pleading show another kind of concrete injury that satisfies the standing in case of controversy requirements and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.701" offset="2062779">We found ourselves with an inheritance tax claim which it, which we and the estate mutually desire to compromise and thereby avoid years of costly litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.175" offset="2112621">Dependency of the Texas' claim was all that stood in the way of California and the estate, totally resolving the inheritance tax matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.535" offset="2146058">It was dependency of that claim which prevented the estate from unconditionally agreeing to settle this case for a very understandable reason, if they agreed to pay a large tax to California and they are liable to it, Texas for a 16% tax, the result would be devastating and if they were unwilling and understandably so to agree, this is the problem with any situation of an interpleader type, where you cannot get all of the parties under -- into one Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.308" offset="4505124">I cannot tell you what the Californian Courts will do anymore than Texas could in Texas v. Florida, that litigation of course came here before any litigation had occurred in any State and the Court rejected Justice Frankfurter's suggestion that it was premature I had mentioned the first of the considerations and the second one has to do with Western Union and I think Western Union is an important case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.755" offset="4610972">In our view, for reasons set forth in our papers in some detail, we think Western Union took Texas V. Florida one more step and made the exercise of this Court's jurisdiction mandatory and not simply optional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.920" offset="4659560">In cases where, and they are rare, where two or more States seek to tax the State beyond the point of confiscation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.550" offset="4694146">I have read and reread Texas's reply on that point and I do not understand that they seem to contend that Western Union is distinguishable because it involves the dispute over property, the location of which was in question whereas here in Texas v. Florida the property is located within the borders of Texas and thus it has exclusive interim jurisdiction over the property and for most part that is in this State consists of stock in a corporation which will be taxed in the place of domicile and so Texas's position assumes the answer to the question that has to be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.516" offset="4838028">That really is the same problem as there was in Western Union and the Court said in that case that Pennsylvania lacked jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.923" offset="4867599">As a matter of federal constitutional law lacked jurisdiction to proceed because it could not assure Western Union that it would not be liable inconsistently to the escheat demands of other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.241" offset="4916918">I think that one passage in the Court's opinion on that point is quite significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.350" offset="4933323">The Court said, the situation here in Western Union is in all material respects like that which caused us to take Jurisdiction in Texas versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.025" offset="4968014">So, as we read Western Union and as we read it today, that decision obliged us and indeed obliged -- obliged Texas to come to this Court rather than to proceed in our own State Court's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.853" offset="5015348">Once it became clear that tax claims were being asserted in excess of the amount of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.554" offset="5042097">Finally, another factor, I want to mention just briefly that brought us here and I think it is important for this this Court's exercise of Jurisdiction was our own sense of fairness to have proceeded independently to litigate the tax claim in our own Court's as Texas sought to do, even if we could do so, Western Union not withstanding, simply did not comport with our notion of a fair and appropriate process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.379" offset="5157454">It seemed to us that it would be incredibly inefficient to generate multiplicitous litigation which would only degenerate, into a -- but it really would be a three ring circus, without a ring master there would be litigation in California, Texas, and if it had a Delaware -- all proceeding without any ability to achieve --</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.786" offset="5347103">After all, we are accountable to that sort of standards as well and it seem to us that all of the decisions that are relevant in this Court and all of the literature in the last four years in Texas versus Florida condemned that a process by which, and a State can be wiped out by inconsistent domicile litigation in several States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.657" offset="5530587">The position of Texas as I understand is that our agreement demonstrates, in some fashion, that we are here suing on behalf of private citizens and not on behalf of a State and that makes relevant, small number of cases New Hampshire versus Louisiana, Oklahoma Ex Rel. Johnson versus Cook, which disentitled a State to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.098" offset="5616373">On really, on the ground of the Eleventh Amendment and it is a limitation on the Court's Jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.631" offset="5634450">That position of Texas is both factually and legally unsound here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.161" offset="5652526">There are two cases on that point that I want to call to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.613" offset="5666423">One is cited in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.039" offset="5672066">South Dakota versus North Carolina, where the Court distinguished those earlier cases in a situation in which a small number of bonds of the State had been assigned to South Dakota and they have been assigned unconditionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.799" offset="5727132">The motive of the donor was perfectly apparent from writings that are cited in the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.679" offset="5750642">He brought that suit for reasons of his, or he made that donation for reasons of his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.616" offset="5766420">The Court said motive of the donor is irrelevant, South Carolina -- South Dakota is suing for interests, however small of its own and the action can be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.267" offset="5804977">Another case not cited in our brief but I do want to call of the Court's attention is North Dakota versus Minnesota in 263 US at 365 and then another opinion at 584.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.614" offset="5850430">There a suit was brought by one State complaining of flooding caused by the acts of the neighboring state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.518" offset="5874045">The loss caused by the flooding did millions of dollars of damage to private lands in the plaintiff State and something like $5000 of damages to the States on bridges and highways as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.151" offset="5920543">The Court allowed the Act even though the interest of the State was rather small and even though it noted in the Second of the two opinions that the land owners of the plaintiff state who had been affected by the flooding and I quote “raised a fund to conduct a litigation” I think it is apparent that in that case the State was induced to Act by the private citizens who stood to benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.297" offset="6005075">Thus, as I read the case, as the State may sue in this Court, not withstanding that private citizens are benefited and even though, private citizens induce the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.568" offset="6046244">Now, having said all that I want to say, that that is not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.654" offset="6062544">The record before this Court, I refer to an affidavit that I have filed at the time of the Application for a preliminary injunction shows that the decision to file the suit was made several weeks before we had had any conversation whatever with the State on the subject of settlement and in fact General Hill, I am sure will acknowledge, I personally told him in a meeting that I had with him in Austin, Texas on October 21, three weeks before this settlement and before we had any conversation with the State whatsoever that we had intended to initiate suit in this Court that we were drafting papers and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.266" offset="6197023">So, I think that the suggestion that we here carrying the bag for the state acting for its benefit is just plainly false as a factual matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.664" offset="6242580">I have just a few moments left and I would like to save that time for rebuttal, if the Court has no further questions to meet this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.553" offset="6398165">There has been no agreement as to the value of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.616" offset="6418437">There has been one appraisal from Maryland which is highly in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.654" offset="6438499">We think it ridiculously low.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.839" offset="6451246">California can collect if it pierces the corporate veil and that is been done every time it is been tried.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.056" offset="6620102">The State compro is working on that diligently now and Summa's inability to make money and prosper is we think highly exaggerated and certainly not kind of speculation, this Court can indulge in to determine whether there's actually going to be more taxes than the state can stand and then finally Texas versus Illinois, does require clearly, that our inconsistent claim be such that it would impair California's right to collect on its own client, and if it has a meritorious claim and that case obviously does not require or contemplate that our inconsistent claim be such that it would simply impair California's ability to get this estate to settle with them, on some basis that they would consider favorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.294" offset="6833157">That is not a right, that this Court's Jurisdiction is available to protect and they say Texas was all, it was in their way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.251" offset="6884983">That is what he forgot to add, and not in their way to try their case, not in their way to assert their claim or the merits of their claim, not in a way to impair their ability to collect on taxes but in their way to get a favorable settlement of a claim that they are very reluctant to try on its merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.127" offset="6988428">Justice Stevens question is correct in suggesting that we should be confident that the Courts in both States would reach the same results on the same facts and certainly out of respect for the State Court's and their proceedings, we should at least not indulge in the opposite presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.649" offset="7206499">If fairness is the standard, why do they come here tendering the limited issue and the only issue to this Court and that is Texas domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.831" offset="7251220">Now, it is Texas position that the agreement that was entered in to on November the 10th 1977, the day before this motion for leave was filed entered into between the state's administrator, certain here and there and California.</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.653" offset="11566544">Mr. Attorney General, a while ago you said that the figure of 120%, that is referring to the aggregate amount of taxes was absurd, ridiculous something like that and that in any event it was not more that a 101%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.725" offset="11622864">Now for the purposes of this, case what is the difference whether it a 100-- the taxes are 101% of all the assets or 98% of all the assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.553" offset="11662152">I think for today at least, for the purpose of this hearing, the answer would be that if it is a 101 and we do not know but let us assume for purpose of your question it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.696" offset="11706665">Then California is petitioning here to get you to vitalize an agreement which would cut there, would harm them 68 % of what they say, they are entitled to under their figures and yet they want you to do it under the authority of the case that would say we are going to protect you from 1% of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.781" offset="11795063">So under this agreement, it is just simply immaterial inquiry, now as to whether it is a 101% ends up being 98%.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.449" offset="11933721">Now there cannot be any doubt about that we are here pursuant to that agreement and that is the full answer, a complete answer, a total answer to the denial of this motion for leave to file and invoke this Court's to original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.301" offset="11993176">Never should this Court tolerate that kind of a situation and you would rule to death (ph) if you did and open the gates for this kind of trading around between higher State tax cases, the States with weak claims, to try to get negative finding against 16% States with good claims.</text>
