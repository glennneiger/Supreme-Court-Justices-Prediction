            <text syncTime="18.417" offset="153654">The first case, 77-152, captioned Beth Israel Hospital versus the National Labor Relations Board, in that case the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit enforced so much of an order of the National Labor Relations Board as required Beth Israel, a non-profit hospital, whose employees came under the protection of National Labor Relations Act only in 1974 when that Act was amended to bring employees of non-profit hospitals within the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.758" offset="302970">The Court of Appeals enforced the order which required the hospital to rescind a rule, prohibiting its employees from soliciting union support and distributing union literature during nonworking time in the hospital cafeteria and in adjoining coffee shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.651" offset="382591">The cafeteria was patronized primarily by employees, but also by patients and by visitors to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.128" offset="432433">A survey conducted by the hospital itself revealed that 77% of the cafeteria's patrons were employees, only 9% were visitors and only one-and-a-half % were patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.075" offset="500247">And the evidence was also that although petitioner employees approximately 2200 regular employees, this hospital incidentally is in Boston, access the most of those employees was possible only in the cafeteria which was in effect the only common gathering room at the hospital set aside for employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.108" offset="592407">Well, the National Labor Relations Board held that the hospital's rule violated Sections 8 (a) (1) and the (3) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.117" offset="628456">The Court of Appeals agreed only insofar as the rule applied to the cafeteria, and for reasons that stated in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.440" offset="685716">Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Powell have filed separate opinions in both of which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist joined, concurring in the judgment.</text>
