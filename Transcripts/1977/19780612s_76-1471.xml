            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80017">The judgments and opinion of the court in 16-1471 Federal Communications Commission against The National Citizens Committee for broadcasting and five consolidated cases will be announced by Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="17.548" offset="150130">These cases are here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.738" offset="178969">At issue a Federal Communication Commission regulations on the subject of cross ownership that is common ownership of a radio or television broadcast station and a daily newspaper located in the same community.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.792" offset="247096">The regulation banned on all new licensing of such combinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.940" offset="267681">Existing newspaper broadcast combinations are allowed to continue an operation except in communities in which the only broadcast station and the only newspaper are commonly owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.433" offset="325673">In the later situation, divestiture of either the newspaper or the broadcast station is generally required within five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.628" offset="366528">The Court of Appeals affirmed the perspective ban, but held that commission had acted arbitrarily in not ordering divestiture of all existing newspaper broadcast combinations located in the same community.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.130" offset="432461">In an opinion filed with the clerk, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar, as it upholds the perspective ban, but reverse the judgment insofar as it orders divestiture of all existing combinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.709" offset="502783">We hold that the commission's regulations are valid in their entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.156" offset="524621">There are reasonable means of enhancing diversity of viewpoints in the mass media and thus state forth within the commission statutory, rule making authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.801" offset="575194">Moreover, given the physical scarcity of broadcast frequencies, nothing in the First Amendment prevents the commission from allocating broadcast licenses so as to promote diversification in the mass media as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.821" offset="643217">We conclude finally that the commission's decision not to order divestiture of all existing newspaper broadcast combinations was based on a rational weighing of competing policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.572" offset="702254">The Commission found that the existing cross owners had a long record of meritorious service and cross support divestiture requirement, cross disruption for the industry and ownership for the individual owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.466" offset="765784">In light of these findings, the commission did not act arbitrarily in confining divestiture to cases of local monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.212" offset="804863">Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
