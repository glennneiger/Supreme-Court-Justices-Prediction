            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="62.104" offset="328385">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.808" offset="351164">These cases are here on petition for certiorari to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.054" offset="392229">There are many parties and several issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.889" offset="407484">All arise out of the ownership of a newspaper and of a broadcast facility, television or radio, in the same community by the same interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.689" offset="470700">In the terms of the trade, this is known as cross-ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.383" offset="501525">The issues here result from an order of the Federal Communications Commission made in 1975 after five years of hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.136" offset="548545">This was a rule making proceeding and the result is known as the Commission’s Second Report and Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.021" offset="588042">It occupies most of the first volume of the appendix from pages 134 to 338.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.575" offset="634227">The ruling announced by the Commission was that it would not hear after grant a new broadcast license or transfer of license where there was cross-ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.168" offset="704653">This is known as the prospective rule, but the Commission also determined that it would not apply this rule retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.034" offset="748121">That is, that it would not refuse to renew existing licenses solely on the ground of cross-ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.794" offset="791171">This is known as the grandfather provision of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.558" offset="810188">There was however an exemption to the grandfather rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.293" offset="833175">In sixteen small market situations, where there was no other newspaper and no other comparable broadcast facility, the Commission did apply its new rule to existing licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.361" offset="905378">It said that they must divest either the newspaper or the broadcast facility by 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.796" offset="951144">Numerous appeals were taken to the Court of Appeals for the District Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.840" offset="975282">The Federal Communications Commission naturally defended its order, but the Department of Justice attacked it, the government speaking with many voices, particularly with respect to the grandfather provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.239" offset="1056888">The Court of Appeals last March affirmed the prospective order, but it found that the grandfather provision was invalid because it said it was not rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.661" offset="1122612">It held that because of a compelling presumption and that is the court’s words, in favor of diversity, “Divestiture is required accept in those cases where the evidence clearly demonstrates that cross-ownership is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.608" offset="1214354">Under the judgment of the court, those portions of the orders that have retroactive effect and those portions dealing with existing combinations are vacated and the record is remanded to the Commission for adoption rules not in consistent with the opinion of the Court of Appeals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="307.972" offset="1311843">In this Court, there are widely divergent interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.251" offset="1332950">I represent the private parties; newspapers and broadcast stations and the American News Paper Publishers Associations and the National Association of Broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.555" offset="1398152">Some of my clients are concerned with the perspective rule and others are primarily concerned with the grandfather question.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.182" offset="1436709">I am also appearing for the small market situations and also for some newspaper radio combinations which seem to be at some risk of being lost in the shuffle.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.875" offset="1499507">I now turn to the validity of the prospective rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.412" offset="1525629">There is a serious constitutional question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.443" offset="1545691">The petitioners, newspapers and broadcast stations are subjected to blanket exclusion from Commission licensing merely because they engage in publishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.480" offset="1609848">The government may not condition the grant of a privilege on the forfeiture of a constitutional right, as in effect this Court held in the Simmons case some ten years ago in a different context.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="397.696" offset="1670766">Mr. Griswold, suppose a television station had broadcast which were clearly, for the purposes of my question, clearly an after task, the hurdles of the obscenity decisions of this Court, that is we would not sustain a criminal conviction for what they had shown on the television, would that be a ground considered denial renewal of the license of the end of the three year validity?</text>

            <text syncTime="428.699" offset="1794795">That would certainly be a ground to be taken into account along with all the other factors in determining whether the license should be renewed.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.696" offset="1850697">Because we are not dealing here with something which says, this is merely a ground to be taken into account with all the other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.552" offset="1890194">We are dealing here with a blanket rule which says that if you are in common ownership with a newspaper, you cannot receive a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.560" offset="1930214">Now, whether you get a renewal or not is the question of the grandfather rule which is the next part of my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.018" offset="1956023">Let me change my hypothetical then the only adverse evidence against the broadcaster is found in the series of broadcast of the kind I included in my original hypothetical question and the Commission said any licensee which resists in that kind of broadcasting will not be renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.056" offset="2040137">That is --</text>

            <text syncTime="898.895" offset="3675507">What do you do when you have more applicants than you can handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.781" offset="3691076">You take into account a great many factors and you come up with your conclusion and that it seems to me is what is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.118" offset="3732454">Diversity is an appropriate factor, but it is not appropriate to make it the exclusive factor which the Court of appeals did below.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.982" offset="3771846">The First Amendment is a shield not a sword to promote diversity, but the Court need not resolve this constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.453" offset="3813747">Just as in Helvring against Griffiths, it held that in the absence of a clear statement by Congress, it need not decide whether stock dividends are constitutionally subject to income tax and I may add that Congress has never made that decision when constituting stock dividends or not subject to income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.534" offset="3894100">By any analysis, the prospective rule is clearly a legislative action which can only be supported by an adequate delegation from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.035" offset="3936104">It is my contention that Congress has never made any such delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.164" offset="3956584">In addition to the constitutional though, we have the fact that the ban on cross-ownership is a fundamental exercise of governmental power affecting important aspects of our free society and involving a substantial change in the practice over the past half century.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.461" offset="4041848">There is room to argue I think that such a fundamental change, going beyond radio and television, and reaching into the printed press, is one which should be made or authorized by representatives of the people in Congress and that authority to make such a change should not be inferred or surmised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.655" offset="4126589">Now in our briefs, we have discussed the nature of the authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.231" offset="4148846">All that has ever been given with the Commission was given to it in 1934 when it was given power over communication by wire or radio, not power over newspapers and it was also given authority to grant licenses if public convenience interest or necessity will be served thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.391" offset="4237557">Language obviously taken over from the traditional public utility statute without any thought of newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.105" offset="4276428">Moreover, we have some legislative history which is pretty good, detailed in the newspaper, in particular in 1952, the Senate passed the statute affecting the powers of the Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.938" offset="4359706">The House amended that statute with an explicit provision saying you do not have any power over newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.747" offset="4386978">The exact language is quoted in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.107" offset="4400353">It went to conference and the conference took out the house amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.101" offset="4420415">But the Conference Committee issued a report in which it stated that this was taken out because it was unnecessary that the Commission did not have any power over newspapers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.381" offset="4509440">We are dealing with what the 1952 Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.750" offset="4522919">The 1952 Congress, many times committee reports have been used to establish the intention or meaning of an Act of Congress and in the hierarchy of committee reports, conference committees are the very highest and here we have a Conference Committee report, clearly dealing with this question after which both houses passed the statute and the President signed it and I would suggest that is I agree, it is not language and the statute, but it is the closest to it that you will ever find and it is not simply a case of subsequent members saying, well, we did mean so and so back there in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.537" offset="4686132">Now, I must turn to the grandfather question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.855" offset="4703373">The action of the Commission making its new rule in applicable to existing licensees except in certain small market situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.694" offset="4742766">The court below has held that the Commission could not in the court’s words rationally reach the conclusion in favor of grandfathering and it is held, apparently based on First Amendment values that there is a “presumption in favor of divestiture” which must be given “controlling weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.561" offset="4838165">”So that “divestiture” is required except in those cases where the evidence clearly discloses that cross-ownership is in the public interest and the court expressly recognized that its pronouncement was a “court approved policy” and it remanded the case to the Commission for adoption of a rule not in consistent with its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.663" offset="4958642">In doing this, the court violated proper standards of judicial review because it is not its function to tell the Commission what rule to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.965" offset="4995840">For example, if the Commission knew that it could not use the grandfathering technique in this area, it might decide that no rule at all is preferable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.476" offset="5033874">That is the matter with the Commission not the court, but the court below has decided that divestiture is required except on an affirmative showing of public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.608" offset="5090403">In essence, this is the question which was decided by this Court six years ago in the Democratic National Committee case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.657" offset="5122586">There the court below held that the Commission must make a new rule requiring licensees to accept editorial advertising on the same general ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.752" offset="5162919">This Court held that there was no such constitutional requirement and that Court should not freeze the Commission’s necessarily dynamic process into a constitutional holding, but this is precisely what the court below has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.786" offset="5231151">It has required that a specific rule be adopted because in the Court’s view and words, the First Amendment’s search for truth will be facilitated by governmental policy that facilitates diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.231" offset="5296875">There is no basis I think upon which this conclusion can be supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.746" offset="5326968">I am supported with respect to the grandfather argument by counsel for the Federal Communications Commission and I think that I will leave most of the rest of the argument to Mr. Armstrong, but this Court has held in the Idaho Power Case that the selection of appropriate policies in carrying out statute is an administrative, not a judicial decision and in Board of Trade against the United States, a good many years ago the Court said, we certainly have neither technical competence nor legal authority to pronounce upon the wisdom of the course taken by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.999" offset="5503974">Now, there are two remaining issues to which I can give on a brief consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.997" offset="5527902">In its final order, the Commission listed sixteen situations to which it did not apply the grandfather rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.014" offset="5559980">These are seven cases where there was co-ownership of the only newspaper and the only television station in the community, even if there were radio stations in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.512" offset="5606060">There were also nine situations were there was a single newspaper and a single radio station or a combination of AM/FM radio stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.894" offset="5651513">These situations have been called egregious cases, but I think that is too pejorative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.191" offset="5680771">They may more accurately be called small market cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.628" offset="5702504">The Court of Appeals set aside this portion of the Commission’s decision and in this respect the court’s decision should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.065" offset="5748271">The Court of Appeals was correct in holding that “the record contain no evidence that justified the desperate treatment of the sixteen affected combinations” and the Commission itself said that the rules are not in the least premise on the existence of improprieties in the operation of the media holdings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.087" offset="5880346">I would suggest that a rule which is applicable to only sixteen instances out of hundreds is not really a rule, but necessarily involves what amounts to an adjudication with respect to those sixteen instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.515" offset="5934054">For example, in some of these cases there is a cable television.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.392" offset="5949518">In one of the cases, where there is a newspaper and a television station, there are seven radio stations in addition to separately owned in the community and all of those things it seems to me should be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.983" offset="6011899">This question of the small market cases is dealt with more fully in the red covered brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.492" offset="6057979">Finally, I would say that this dog has a very small tail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.927" offset="6079713">There are a few situation of cross-ownership of a newspaper and radio station where there are other broadcasters, television or radio in the same community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.735" offset="6130913">These were not covered by the Commission’s order because of the grandfather’s clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.915" offset="6151602">However, should the Court uphold the Court of Appeals and saying that the grandfather’s clause is invalid then they would be swept in, but the position is made in the blue and the green brief, that radio is different from television, that there should be separate consideration to the question whether the rule should apply to radio, and where there is only a radio or television and there are other voices in the community and my position is that care should be taken to see that these newspaper radio combinations are not just caught up in the draft and carried away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.955" offset="6339788">Our basic contention is that the Commission had no authority to make any rules in this area either for constitutional or statutory reasons, but that if did have that such authority, it did have power to make the grandfather provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.247" offset="6496940">The Commission’s fundamental position in these consolidated cases is first, that our prospective rule is a rational exercise of a rule making authority grounded in the public interest standard of the 1934 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.001" offset="6563918">Secondly, that our refusal to apply the new policy against additional co-located newspaper broadcast combinations to existing combinations, except in certain of the small market cases is rational and was adequately explained in the Second Report and Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.513" offset="6653989">On the first contention at the outset, I believe a question came up as the whether the Commission felt that the First Amendment was the source of the prospective rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.622" offset="6906436">Yes sir and not the First Amendment, I understand your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.532" offset="6918139">In applying that diversity component of the public interest standard, the courts, both the Court of Appeals and this Court’s dictum in the 1959 RCA Case have long recognized and being visible conceded this that one of the relevant factors the Commission can take into account in citing how to allocate spectrum resources is whether the applicant before it has ownership interest, not only in other broadcast stations, but also in newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.790" offset="7047079">So, and I believe Mr. Chief Justice that you may have alluded to this, as we view this case, the real question in this case raised by the prospective rule is not a First Amendment question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.516" offset="7090024">It is whether the Commission has rationally in applying the public interest standard of the Act reached the position where it is ready to announce that this one relevant factor is now going to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.642" offset="7146553">I might say it is not determinative in an exceptional case which might warrant a waiver of the rule, but for purposes of argument since that is admittedly an exceptional case we will precede on the assumption that we said it is going to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.745" offset="7202978">And the Commission will respectfully submit that that is not a case of first impression before this Court because prior to the adoption of the multiple ownership rules that was before the Court in the Storer Broadcasting case in 1956, if an applicant owned seven AM radio stations for example and was applying to the Commission for an eighth AM radio station, presumably it would have been recognized that in applying the diversity policy in passing on that application, the Commission could certainly take into account the fact that the applicant already owned seven AM stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.004" offset="7355951">But the argument prior to this Court’s decision in Storer which the Court of Appeals in the Storer case had accepted was that the Commission could not make that one fact determinative and would instead be able to deny that application only after a full hearing in which the applicant could submit all of the so-called other relevant factors, the applicant wished to consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="2386.911" offset="9627559">On the statutory authority point we have two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.794" offset="9643128">The first one was suggested by Mr. Justice Rehnquist and that is we think for the reasons that I have gone through that the 34 statute, the public interest rule making standard authority given to the Commission in Section 303 as interpreted by this Court in Storer is sufficient to answer the case and that the Court should not give much if any weight to subsequent legislative history that was relied on by the Mr. Griswold, but if the Court is disposed to take into account subsequent legislative history, we call the Court’s attention to the 74 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.694" offset="9790772">In 1952 as it was recognized in the argument, neither the House, actually well the House of Representative had, but in the final analysis it was just a conference committee report and there was no legislation on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.349" offset="9837375">But in 1974, the Congress was fully aware of the Commission’s outstanding rule-making proceeding which is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.151" offset="9872588">They followed it closely and there was interchange between the Commission and the Congress concerning the evolution of that percept and each House went on record with a legislative bill in 1974 which we would respectfully submit, simply is inconsistent with the notion that Congress in 1952 had denied our authority in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.408" offset="9969554">The House of Representatives said whatever it is you are going to do in your outstanding proceeding on the basis of newspaper broadcast cross ownership, do it in a rule making percept and also finish that rule making proceeding by a date certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.655" offset="10030576">The Senate took out the first provision, but also passed a provision saying in this outstanding proceeding you have got proposing a rule to ban future newspaper broadcast cross ownership, finish it by a certain date and although the two houses, the different versions were not reconciled and no legislation ever emerged, we do think that the 1974 history would remove any possible conclusion that in 1952 our general rule making authority had been cut down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.537" offset="10142067">To turn to our case before this Court as a petitioner, it is our argument that the distinction between the prospective and retroactive rules is rational one and was adequately explained in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.809" offset="10219180">In the case of the prospective rule, the Commission admittedly operating on the presumption that it was more realistic to expect true diversity if you did not have common ownership decided to give that consideration determinative weight, even though we recognized and the court below recognized this, that there was no guarantee that the more diverse new points would result if we did have separate ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.169" offset="10356689">But the Commission said under these circumstances, a prospective rule where you are not talking about other countervailing considerations, we think the one reason that we had once had for allowing that is no longer determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.469" offset="10405799">In other words, we can have a pool of other people coming forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.881" offset="10423458">We no longer have to rely upon a newspaper owner to get service started and so under those circumstances, even though the gain in diversity may be slight, it may be only hoped for in great many cases, nevertheless where there is no real cost on the other side of the balance wheel, we are going to get it determinative weight.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3416.822" offset="13747278">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.554" offset="13754175">Under Section 307 of the Communications Act, the Federal Communications Commission is to grant applications for broadcast licenses if the public convenience interest or necessity will be served thereby, and for more than 30 years, in both rule making and licensing proceedings, the Commission has recognized that this standard requires it to take into account in issuing licenses, the interest of the public in diversity of ownership of the media of communications and among the factors that is historically considered for this purpose in comparative proceedings over the years has been an applicant's ownership of the daily newspaper in the locality to be served by the broadcasting license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.507" offset="13997949">In this respect, the Commission is charged not to be neutral, but to make an inquiry as to what will serve the public interest under the Statutory Standard, and one of the components of the public interest is diversity of ownership of the media of communications and divergent voices to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.884" offset="14103484">The present rule, before this Court, is an effort to deal with newspaper broadcast co-ownership question in a more systematic way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.781" offset="14159073">It is not a rule that disqualifies newspaper owners from being licensees of broadcast stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.318" offset="14193241">The rule applies only to co-ownership of a newspaper and a broadcast facility in the same community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.992" offset="14231902">Newspaper owners are not disqualified under this rule from ownership of broadcast stations from licensing broadcast stations, no one owns the particular airways, but from being licensees of broadcast stations in other communities and that is an important distinction to keep in mind here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.454" offset="14333780">It is illustrated very well by the recent exchange between the Detroit News and the Washington Post of television stations in those two cities, which will result in dissolution of two of the two co-ownership situations that were before the Commission when it was considering this rule, by means of the swapping that the Commission anticipated could occur without in any way making newspaper owners as such ineligible to be licensees of broadcasting stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.111" offset="14500441">But, by applying the public interest standard in a licensing of broadcasting stations, so as to increase or at least to protect against diminishing, the diversity of voices to be heard in that community based on a finding of the Commission or based on its experience and much evidence was before it, that the public looks primarily to these two sources, to its daily newspapers and its local broadcasting stations and particularly its local television stations for its news and for its information on public affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.909" offset="14679641">And this is accentuated with respect to local news affairs of the handling of this matter by the adoption of a rule rather than case by case as it has been handled over the years, is entirely appropriate to facilitate business planning and to enable the Commission to bring about required changes as a result of reconsiderations of its earlier policies in which it has granted some so-ownerships of co-located stations, cross-ownerships by means of what has been referred to in these proceedings as divestiture rather than what is being referred to as forfeiture of licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.393" offset="14869499">And it is important that any retrospective application that the Commission was considering here was not to being achieved by means of simply forfeiting the value of the license and the goodwill at the time a renewal would come up two or three years hence, by holding a comparative proceeding and simply awarding the license to other applicants, so that the licensee would be able to realize only the physical value of its assets as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.499" offset="14993946">The Commission was concerned with protecting licensees against this result by providing a means whereby they would have a reasonable period to swap stations or otherwise to realize the market value of their licenses all with the view toward what the Commission has over the years, we think legitimately recognized to be a component of the public interest standard that it should provide incentives for superior public service, incentives to get people to devote their financial resources and their professional endeavors to providing a superior service without the risk of having to start from scratch when they have provided such as service every three years, in a comparative proceedings against others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.426" offset="15213688">If the public is to be well served in this interest, the Commission undertook to protect this interest by proceeding in a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.772" offset="15259037">Making proceeding rather than merely applying from case to case, the new insights and the further insights that is developed into the problem of concentration of ownership of the media and the problems that it has presented that have come to its attention over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.682" offset="15346704">It further sought to protect these interests by specifying that it would certify transfers that resulted from the divestiture provisions that it would adopt, and it did adopt some as the Court has been informed for favorable tax treatment under Section 1071 of the Internal Revenue Code, in order to further protect those interests because the transfers were being ordered in the public interest and a waiver provision was also adopted under which claims of particular hardship could be heard with a view toward possibly extending the time in individual cases and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.048" offset="15556101">So the rule that has been adopted in so far as it applies prospectively, it seems to us to be valid and reasonable way to apply the public interest standard that the Commission long has been applying under the Act based on the commerce power of Congress and the divestitures that were ordered under that rule we also think were valid regardless of how one views the refusal to order the further divestitures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.091" offset="15708343">In that respect, we disagree with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.199" offset="15724748">We think that Commission did have authority based on the considerations that were before it to recognize that especially severe problems existed in communities in which there were for example only one daily newspaper and one television station where there would be a mutual inhibition on cross criticism between the two major media in the community which in itself would leave the community without any independent voice to criticize the impact that those media have on the community and the effect on its affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.592" offset="15898305">We think that this is an egregious consideration that the Commission did properly recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.959" offset="15927771">We disagree on the Court of Appeals that there was no rational basis for singling out those particular examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.065" offset="15972180">We do not believe, however, that the grandfathering that the Commission has adopted with respect to the other existing cross-ownerships was rationally justified by the considerations that the Commission itself chose to rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.004" offset="16055980">On the Commission’s own terms we do not think the lines that it has drawn, the basic differentiation is introduced between the existing cross-ownerships and the future license questions, including transfers has been rationally justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.840" offset="16147304">Before I turn to the reasons why the Commission’s justification do not stand up, it is important I think to recognize that very important interests are at stake here in what the Commission has decided because not only the public interest that this Court has recognized in the Associated Press case and the other cases dealing with the First Amendment aspects of regulation in the area of news media, the public interest in the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources as it was put there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.951" offset="16311771">But there were a number of examples before the Commission of disadvantages flowing from cross-ownership or safeguards from having an independent voice to which the Commission was surely entitled to give weight without going into great detail about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.600" offset="16382406">Examples were cited to the Commission, the joint operating agreement being --</text>

            <text syncTime="4141.812" offset="16647184">Not at all, but it does have to base the way it applies that change on rational grounds that do not treat individuals arbitrarily based on factors that are unrelated rationally to the basis at which the agency has changed its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.654" offset="16742583">I want to just mention one or two examples that were before the Commission and to which it obviously gave some weight in adopting the prospective rule and of the divestiture requirement that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.038" offset="16788140">One was an example of joint operating agreements that had been a subject of negotiation between the daily newspapers in a city and which were being opposed by labor unions and others in the community and where allegations were made that the television station owned by one of those newspapers presented no news concerning those agreements and their negotiations until they were consummated and that to have done so would have been against the economic interest of the newspaper that owns the television station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.539" offset="16966086">Another example was editorial support in the local newspapers for a particular location for a museum to be built in the city which a location was close to where the newspapers were being published where there is considerable sentiment for the museum to be located elsewhere which is brought out only and independently operated television station in that community and was not allegedly covered in the particular papers involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.408" offset="17121567">These are examples and the idea is not whether the particular examples were accurate but here were the kinds of dangers that the Commission had before it and obviously had in mind in its concern about cross-ownerships here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.395" offset="17185515">The other factor to keep in mind is that the prospective rule that the Commission did adopt does have effect on existing combinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.874" offset="17239432">This is not a bright line between a prospective rule and a retrospective rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.440" offset="17261688">It has an effect on existing combinations by a process of gradual attrition of existing cross-ownerships at the time they are transferred for value and for example when the Washington Star in this city was sold within recent years, the transfer policy was applied to it and the co-owned television station could not be transferred to the same owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.576" offset="17382269">The result was a dissolution of that ownership where the competitive daily newspaper, The Washington Post was allowed to continue to have its locally owned co-located commonly owned television station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.704" offset="17458756">This introduces a disparity between newspapers in the same community which is a serious matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.523" offset="17498044">I do not say that it is not a constitutional disparity, that it is not something that Congress could have adopted, but it is a disparity in treatment in a constitutionally sensitive area which impels us to take a careful look at the reasons given by the Commission --</text>

            <text syncTime="4953.171" offset="19892637">They do have wide discretion, but it seems to me conceivable, that as long as there are not arbitrary on remand, they may adapt no rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="4965.791" offset="19943105">But if they do adapt the prospective rule, as they did here, and in their discretion found that nothing can be more important than insuring that there is a free flow of information, the Public has the right to know it, it derives from, but not just the First Amendment, it also derives from Section 303 (g) of the Communications Act which is on page A 29 of the joint appendix where it says, Congress mandated the Commission to promote the effective, the larger, and more effective use of radio in the NBC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.949" offset="20051775">The Court in NBC said that this included a concern about the monopolization of media, but the Commission did come out with a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.441" offset="20085734">They said that, it is unrealistic to expect a true diversity from newspaper broadcast station combinations, and therefore, in looking only to the broadcasting stations, and they not trying to regulate newspapers, they treat newspapers as they treat television stations to the extent you cannot own two television stations in the same market and they look to the equality more or less in terms of where people get most their news and information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.256" offset="20209032">But when it came time to apply this to renewal, even though there is a three-year limit on renewals set by Congress and even though the Communications Act mandates larger and more effective use of radio, the Commission moved to immunize existing licensees from structural challenge on from the basis of the concentration of the control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.655" offset="20322612">And on these three points, the Commission used to override the strong factor of the diversity, the Commission itself has said that diversity is the primary licensing factor and yet they look to this three overriding factors to this diversity criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.136" offset="20384470">And the first, Mr. Justice Stevens, with regard to the local ownership, the first thing that Commission did was ban local ownership in the prospective rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="5116.856" offset="20547370">Secondly, the Commission only looks to local ownership, traditionally and on the 1965 Policy Statement on renewals.</text>

            <text syncTime="5379.171" offset="21596656">We read the decision for instance in footnote 53, to contemplate that there might be a totally different rule, a totally different even prospective rule in terms of a 30% criterion as was suggested by some people including some parties here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.595" offset="21654335">But getting on to the local economic dislocations criterion, the Commissions says, we are afraid, in fact they do not make it clear again, we are not sure what they said, except that the counsels explain that they say that they are concerned about reinvestment of having enough money to increase interest rates, or concerned that interest rates will increase, if there is a widespread divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.045" offset="21748166">And they were concerned if there would be enough money to invest in the program, and yet the Commission specifically has refused to look at this question in licensing cases, and in the Alianza case which we cite is an example where the Court of the Appeals has affirmed the Commission’s refusal to look into this criterion in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.420" offset="21813682">Now, they are using that criterion to override their strong interest and diversity of communication sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.666" offset="21850671">Similarly with continuity of ownership and there of course the licensee just minimally served the public interest over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.035" offset="21900095">Mr. Armstrong says, the longevity of their service is the factor that really matters, but if their service has not been good, it may be that the new licensee will do a much better job.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.490" offset="21941891">In the WDHDH case, the one time, when a newspaper television broadcaster cross-owner was replaced with a new applicant, that new applicant, or that new licensee has performed excellently, superior service throughout, and it is recognized throughout the country, to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.540" offset="22014093">Now, of course broadcasters do they take their license subject to renewal at the time and subject to the rules in effect at the time of renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.907" offset="22051605">No license can last no longer than three years, they ran on their record, and you can have the record go on for say that because they did a great job 20 years ago, but have not done a good job the last three years, that does not mean anything, and has not, in the past Commission’s Decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.512" offset="22134047">But the key fact here is the Commission did not really come to a systematic evaluation of the record, they did not really look at their own past precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.595" offset="22174380">They did not look at and there are internal inconsistencies in the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.221" offset="22192875">Now, with the respect to the issue of discretion, in answer to Mr. Chief Justice’s question with respect to the Washington Star, of course the Commission’s Rule applies to transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.112" offset="22252434">The Washington Star was in bad shape according to their allegations and they needed an influx of money and they -- not into a transfer of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.874" offset="22283468">The licensee basically would have continued with Washington Star and WMAL, the radio and television stations, yet the Commission's rule prospectively said that this is a sale and the public interest is not served by the acquisition of a TV and a newspaper or broadcast TV.</text>

            <text syncTime="5579.111" offset="22396421">That is exactly our contention that it should and in fact, what they have done is apply the public interest standard to transfers which they refuse to apply to renewals, and yet it is the same a public interest standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.597" offset="22446367">Now, maybe, there are factors that can override this diversity criterion, with respect to renewal applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.357" offset="22465384">The Commission did not really and rationally dealt with that, and they threw out some reasons, but really the Commission had a goal here, and they stated the goal as diversifying the media of promoting diversification, and yet what it has done is has turned around and protected existing licensees against challenge and against the applications of this public interest standard at renewal time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.059" offset="22560157">And I like to give an example, and what I consider a better example in terms of this issue and that is in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, there was in 1975, a newspaper monopoly owned by one family, the only newspaper in town, the only VHF station in town, two or five radio stations, a cable television system of which it was co-owned, they own 60% or 40% owner, owned two of the remaining three radio stations in town.</text>
            <text syncTime="5646.718" offset="22666841">It was grandfathered because there was an incoming signal from a station assigned to Lebanon and Lancaster, it is hyphenated market and this was a UHF signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.853" offset="22707383">Now, in a consideration on that renewal of that Lancaster Station, the Commission would not allow a showing that the incoming signal was not a significant signal that 15,000 people could not really obtain that signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.935" offset="22771749">It will not allow a showing as to inapplicability of any of these criteria, such as local ownership, such as continuity or local economic dislocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.915" offset="22807589">They would not even allow a showing as to the Sherman Act violation, the allegation of Sherman Act violation which the Commission said was standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.274" offset="22837055">They would not allow a showing because they said they are not equipped to administer the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.108" offset="22852415">There was a catch 22 there and finally, under the reconsideration order, under the Commissions Standards, if that UHF Signal went dark tomorrow, of course the situations has since changed, but, if that signal went dark, the Commission said in reconsideration, that it would not require to divestiture even in that event, even though it met this standard of egregiousness that they have required divestiture for the 16 because they said they are concerned about uncertainty, they did not want the licensees to feel uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5721.073" offset="22964219">Your Honor, if I can just sum up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.549" offset="22978116">I think that the basis here is the First Amendment interest and the diversity of information sources, as Judge Learned Hand said, to some it may be folly, but we have stake upon it our all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.752" offset="23018971">Thank You.</text>
