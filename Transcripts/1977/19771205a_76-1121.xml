            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="68.848" offset="355336">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.050" offset="376129">This case is here on certiorari to the Second Circuit which by a divided vote to night enforcement of the boards order against the respondent Union Writers Guild of America West.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.706" offset="430777">Three petitions to review the Second Circuit’s judgment were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.469" offset="449794">One by the Board, one by the three major television broadcasting companies and one by the Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.683" offset="490650">This Court granted the three petitions and consolidated them for purposes of hearing and decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.236" offset="520847">I am speaking for the Board and will be followed by counsel for the other two petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.776" offset="547074">This case presents another facet of the problem which was before this Court in Florida Power decided in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.247" offset="588975">There the Court held that the union does not violate Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the National Labor Relations Act which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances by disciplining supervisor members for crossing a picket line to perform rank-and-file struck work during an economic strike against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.254" offset="716975">The question here is, whether a different conclusion is warranted where the supervisor members are disciplined or threatened with discipline for crossing the picket line to perform their normal supervisory duties, which includes grievance adjustment or collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.379" offset="793461">Now, the relevant facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.223" offset="812896">Respondent, Writers Guild represents for collective bargaining purposes, writers, who prepare scripts for a motion picture and television firms and who are employed by the major television Net broadcasting companies and by various member firms of the Association of Motion Picture of Producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.027" offset="900041">I refer to both of them as the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.344" offset="917282">The employers also employ producers, directors and story editors to manage and carry out the production of the films.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.877" offset="971512">The producers, directors and story editors when acting as such, are supervisors as defined in Section 211 in the Act and they also represent the employers in the adjustment of grievances and in certain situations producers also represent the employers in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.867" offset="1067434">Some producers, directors and story editors, known as hyphenates and those are the people that we are going to be concerned with in this case, have writing capabilities and are at times employed as writers to prepare scripts or perform other creative writing functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.532" offset="1154056">These hyphenates are members of the Guild.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.219" offset="1168789">The Guild represents hyphenates only when they are employed as writers, not when they are employed as producers, directors or story editors.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.270" offset="1221034">Most hyphenates have personal service contracts with the employers covering their employment as producers, directors or story editors and indeed, under these contracts, they are often represented by other labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.617" offset="1294385">Thus the collective bargaining agreements between the Guild and the employers provide that a person is not subject to those agreements when he is employed in a non-writing capacity, for example, as a producer, director or a story editor.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.700" offset="1362722">The agreements further provide that producers, directors and story editors can perform certain editorial writing services known as “"A through H"” functions without becoming a writer subject to the agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.719" offset="1446836">Now, in March of 1973, the Guild began a strike against the employers in furtherance of their demands for new contracts covering writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.344" offset="1489363">The strike continued against some employers until July of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.800" offset="1511202">A month before the strike started, the Guild distributed strike rules to all union members, including the hyphenates.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.562" offset="1542235">In addition to prohibiting writing for struck employers, the rules prohibited all members, regardless of the capacity in which they were working from crossing union picket lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.999" offset="1595943">The strike rules also prohibited union members from working in the future with members who violated the strike rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.887" offset="1631469">The Guild through a series of special meeting with hyphenate members and phone calls to particular hyphenates, emphasized that the strike rules would apply to hyphenates working in any capacity and that they would be subject to discipline and black listing if they cross the union’s picket lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.486" offset="1721853">The Guild also refused to allow any members, including hyphenates to resign from membership before or during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.696" offset="1766784">The employers demanded that the hyphenates continue, notwithstanding the strike in the picket lines to perform their duties other than as a writer under their personal service contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.499" offset="1825925">Many hyphenates crossed the picket lines to perform their normal supervisory and managerial functions as producers, directors and story editors, including grievance adjustment and collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.691" offset="1882767">They performed no writing work, which would otherwise have been performed by the striking writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.757" offset="1914950">During and after the strike, the Guild filed the internal union charges against 31 hyphenates for crossing the picket lines, 10 hyphenates were subsequently convicted by union trial committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.281" offset="1969076">They were suspended or expelled from union membership and were fined amounts ranging from a $100.00 to $50,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.825" offset="2003244">Later, the union membership voted to reduce the penalties of 9 of the convicted hyphenates and proceedings against other hyphenates were held in abeyance, pending the disposition of unfair labor practice charges which mean, were filed by the employers with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.036" offset="2088090">The Board with member fanning dissenting concluded that the Guild violated Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act by disciplining and threatening to discipline the hyphenates for crossing the picket line to perform their normal supervisory duties and the a divided Court of Appeals agreeing with member offending the night enforcement of the Board’s order.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.056" offset="2188191">Now, we start with Florida Power, which holds that a unions’ discipline of one of its members who is a supervisory employee can constitute a violation of Section 8 (b) (1) (B) only when that discipline may adversely affect the supervisors' conduct in performing the duties of and acting in his capacity as grievance suggester or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.762" offset="2310967">The discipline in Florida Power was found not to have this effect because the supervisors were disciplined for crossing the picket line to engage in rank-and-file struck work.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.214" offset="2360808">Indeed the union did not discipline those supervisors who merely performed their supervisory duties when they crossed the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.572" offset="2406261">The Board submits that when a supervisor member is threatened with discipline or discipline for crossing a picket line to perform his normal supervisory or management duties and they include grievance adjustment and collective bargaining, such discipline may adversely affect the supervisors’ conduct in performing the duties of grievance adjuster or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer, even though the union’s motive is not to influence a particular grievance or collective bargaining decision, but merely to secure adherence to its picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.075" offset="2604269">There are two reasons for this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.209" offset="2624749">One is referred to or can be called the deprivation theory and that is this, as the administrative law judge whose decision was adopted by the Board pointed out, if the hyphenates had succumbed to the Guilds’ threats of discipline as many of them did and had refused to cross the picket lines, the employers would have been deprived of their chosen representatives for the performance of management functions, including grievance adjustment or collective bargaining for the duration of the strike, no less and if the union had directly pressured the employers into removing those representatives from those duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.653" offset="2834565">In short, the effect of the threat of discipline would have been to have deprived the employers of their chosen representatives for grievance adjustment and collective bargaining.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="701.627" offset="2886496">Mr. Come, is it not reasonable to infer that the picket line itself may have had that effect?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="707.226" stopTime="832.633">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="707.226" offset="2908857">That is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.315" offset="2917216">Where the picket line alone is in the picture and the supervisor decides that he is not going to cross that picket line, the employer is deprived of a selected representative because of the free decision of the supervisor to honor or not to honor that picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.842" offset="3015332">However, we submit that where the supervisor honors that picket line as a result of threats of union discipline, the element of restraint and coercion on the part of the union has been added and it is up to the union to disentangle that he would not have crossed, but for that restraint and coercion, and we submit that the union cannot do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.573" offset="3134242">Moreover, as the Board added by the citation of its earlier decisions in Hammond Publisher and Triangle Publications in so far as those hyphenates who defied the union and were disciplined or concerned there is a reasonable likelihood that the discipline would have a carryover effect and affect the future performance of grievance adjustment and collective bargaining functions because hereon like the performance of rank-and-file struck work, which was involved in Florida Power, the duties, which the supervisors were performing, were similar to the functions that they would be performing absent the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.649" offset="3322532">I do not want to cut in any further to my colleague’s time.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.358" offset="3341341">They will develop these theories in further detail.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Mr. Harry J. Keaton</label>
            <text syncTime="834.326" offset="3417305">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.507" offset="3429948">In the time allotted to me, I would like to cover primarily two contentions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.636" offset="3458474">The first one being the contention of the Guild, the respondent herein, that in some ways of work done by the hyphenates, whatever you might call it and they do not call it struck work in their briefs, they call it rank-and-file work without using the word struck, that in some ways, that work, put the work on a pie is a work that this Court held in Florida Power to be of the nature, the Section 8 (b) (1) (B) should not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.321" offset="3557216">The second point that I would like to address myself, is that, Mr. Come referred to as a deprivation theory in somewhat more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.599" offset="3586369">As to the first point that the three-throng argument being made by the Guild at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.687" offset="3610715">It comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.633" offset="3618447">Number one, while there concededly is no evidence in the court, that any writing of scripts was done by any of the people who were disciplined, they might have done writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.541" offset="3674141">Number two, that the “"A through H"” functions are to be construed as bargaining unit type writing and number three, that even if the “"A through H"” functions are not bargaining unit writing, they are not managerial functions, and that therefore, the performance of such functions is not akin to grievance related type work, and therefore, the supervisors could be disciplined.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.483" offset="3789915">Now, taking the first point, namely yes to whether or not they might have done the right thing, the fact of the matter is that the Guild very well knew or at least very well could find out, whether they were writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.274" offset="3841011">There were 15 strike rules in this case, which provide specifically prohibition against writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.437" offset="3869745">Not one of them was invoked by the Guild, not a single one.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.707" offset="3886777">One of those rules, rule 8 is very significant because it specified that any writer in order to perfect himself and that includes of course rank-and-file writers, to protect themselves against future charges, should file with Guild his scripts that he had completed at the time of the strike in order to make quite sure that he will be able prove that he had not written during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.624" offset="3986461">The respondent’s exhibit six which is not in the printed transcript which is a multi-colored script it is in the Court, will illustrate to the Court that it is very easy to tell from a script when the final script was written and when the changes were made, and therefore, it would have been quite easy for the Guild to tell whether or not that work was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.655" offset="4062529">Now, turning to “"A through H",” the Guild analogizes in “"A through H"” to the Shelton Construction Company case, the Shelton Pipeline case, wherein the B representative was held not immune from discipline because he was offering equipment which he had also operated at times when there was a labor shortage, but that case is precisely the opposite from this case because in that collective bargaining agreement, operating equipment was covered by the contract, by so many words, and then the contract said, in the case of an emergency of the purposes of training, a supervisor may operate the equipment not so if you are “"A through H".”</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.189" offset="4216756">The contract specifically states in sections 1 (b) (1) (A) and in 1 (c) (1) (A), that the performance of “"A through H"” functions by producers, directors or story supervisors, shall not be covered by this agreement and shall not cause them to become writers hereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.132" offset="4300452">So, what you really have is not collective bargaining unit work that may be done by supervisors, but work that is not covered by the contract which if you perform it, does not make you a bargaining unit employee, but which conceivably at times could be performed by bargaining unit employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.192" offset="4360743">But now comes the most important point, namely the argument that “"A through H"” supposedly is not managerial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.265" offset="4381014">Let us examine what “"A through H"” is and if the Court please, I will give examples of it, some of them are in the record and some of them are just common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.854" offset="4411421">The first A says, cutting for time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.230" offset="4420825">Now, what does it mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.369" offset="4425422">It means deleting a portion of a movie or a television play in order to make it shorter, in order to accommodate the time for the screen, that is certainly a managerial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.190" offset="4464710">B is bridging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.661" offset="4470562">That means, tying up two pieces of the movie, if you will, due to the elimination of the intervening piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.195" offset="4500759">C is a change in technical or stage direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.632" offset="4514447">Need I say more, direction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.179" offset="4524687">D is the assignment of lines to existing characters due to cast changes, directors do not make those assignments, managers do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.741" offset="4558960">E are changes for legal clearances, done by executives at the request of the legal department according, in the transcript, the testimony of Mr. Middleman, pages 1307 to page 1311 at the association exhibit 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.504" offset="4613922">Now, the casual minor adjustments in dialog covered under F, again there is an example given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.757" offset="4638999">Medical terminology used by a writer, which happens to be erroneous, so they call a doctor, the doctor says the diagnosis is all wrong and they change the name of the illness from one to another, again, done by management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.156" offset="4684557">G are changes necessitated by unforeseen events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.052" offset="4696155">An example is in the transcript at page 204 to 205.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.488" offset="4709948">What happened to us, that they had to change the names of streets from New York City to Los Angeles and H finally, by its own language, which is clearly managerial work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.227" offset="4744847">It is instructions, directions or suggestions, oral or written to a writer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.949" offset="4767731">All of this work is about as managerial as it can be and the interesting distinction is that if you take a look at the lowest level of bargaining unit work, namely the so called rewrite that is carefully defined in the agreement, and you can get motion picture credit for doing a rewrite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.781" offset="4847038">You can do all the “"A through H"” in the world without getting any motion picture credit, there is no credit for that, but on a rewrite, that sure is a credit, pages 239 to 240 B and C.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.859" offset="4891342">The Writer's Guild contends here as the last resort on this issue --</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.366" offset="5341380">Now, to turn briefly to the deprivation theory if I may, I think that the Guild, first of all I think we should dispose of an item if it is of concern at all here, namely the contention of both the Guild and amicus, that there was in some way, nothing that could be brought before this Court own the deprivation theory because it was not part of the Board's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.685" offset="5434689">In the court below, in the District Court of Appeals, in its reply brief, the Guild argued exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.934" offset="5467708">At page 4 of that brief, the Guild stated, just as it did the Board’s brief writer, the association seeks to justify the decision below in this case on the basis of the rationale of later decided both decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.832" offset="5539283">There was only one basis, upon which a violation was found here, namely, that the Guild's discipline kept the employers from utilizing the services of 8 (b) (1) (B) supervisors during the strike, not as a subsequent decision in other cases, rationalized that the discipline would carry over to the supervisors’ future 8 (b) (1) (B) functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.965" offset="5603858">The Guild is now arguing exactly the opposite in this Court, that this was not the basis of the Board decision and only the future function about the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.210" offset="5632802">The answer of course is both are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.398" offset="5641579">Now, in terms of the question of whether or not the statute was violated here, I do not think we have to get involved with such things as Oakland Mailers because what we really have is the other simple preposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.848" offset="5691316">We have people who were told, unlike in Florida Power, if you come to work in any capacity, including of course 8 (b) (1) (B) capacities, we will fine you, we will discipline you, we will expel you and you cannot resign, all those things were said and to answer further the question that Mr. Justice Stevens asked of Mr. Come, I do not think that a union can fall back on what might well be a legal picket line, if at the same time that the picket line is up, it is threatening people and coercing people and telling them, if you do cross over a picket line, we will punish you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.699" offset="5838751">Anymore, than this Court would hold illegal, that if a union has gone to an employer and said to him, we would like you cease dealing with another employer that this picket line that was subsequently established would in some way be immunized because the employer may have exited because of the unions’ voluntary request, rather than the illegal secondary boycott under the 8 (b) (4) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.415" offset="5937598">I think the analogy is very much the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.270" offset="5948988">Now, what really have here is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.681" offset="5958705">The union in effect is saying, you must not use these supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.349" offset="5977305">It means we eliminate the supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.297" offset="5985141">They cannot be designated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.316" offset="5993187">If they cannot be designated, you have a clear violation of the statute itself and you have the violation, just as surely as the union had put up a picket line to prevent the hiring of a supervisor or the use of a designated representative of the employer for purposes of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.826" offset="6067270">It is precisely the case of Congress was talking about in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.198" offset="6088795">Senator Taft, I believe said, do not send us Mr. Y and send us Mr. X, Mr. Y as being excluded in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.869" offset="6119411">The union will argue, they could resign, in fact the AFL-CIO does, not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.621" offset="6146474">They were not allowed to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.797" offset="6151176">In fact, they were deactivated, and the decisions of this Court aim on the 8 (b) (1) (A) and I recognize 8 (b) (1) (A) is not applicable because the supervisors are not protected, but the decisions of this Court under 8 (b) (1) (A) themselves indicate very clearly that even there discipline would not be lawful if there is not any right to resign at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.469" offset="6229856">Since I want to reserve a little time for a rebuttal for Mr. Come, I would like to conclude on a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.318" offset="6257233">By deactivating and keeping the supervisors as (Inaudible) members in effect the employers were being given two choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.830" offset="6283251">Either, do not use the supervisors during the strike, in other words, do not designate them as 8 (b) (1) (B) representatives and there was plenty of work going on, the record is full of it, scripts were being written and scripts were available, scripts have been finished, there are lots of them in the record and no other union must strike, either, do not use them during the strike or if you do, we are going to expel them, find them, and punish them and you will never be able to use them again because nobody will work with them and you cannot be a producer without the writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.169" offset="6392652">Those were the choices given in effect to management and the other point I wanted to make is that the only way that the decision of the Court of Appeals can be sustained is this Court were to ask to the statute the provision, this Section shall be inapplicable in the event of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.369" offset="6453465">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1672.612" offset="6770382">Now, let me talk about the adverse carryover theory of the Board for liability of the union in this case and that theory started with Florida Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.297" offset="6809148">In Florida Power, the Court said, a union discipline of one of its members who is a supervisor employee can constitute a violation of 8 (b) (1) (B) only when that discipline may adversely affect the supervisor's conduct in the performance of the duties of and acting in his capacity as grievance suggester or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.746" offset="6906950">Now, that is where we start and in this case, we have tremendous conduct on the part of the Guild which Judge Moore in the Second Circuit characterizes in terrorem conduct to adversely affect the supervisors in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.937" offset="6971734">Not only, are we talking about the fines of up to $50,000.00 or the threats or the refusal to accept resignations, but more importantly, they blacklist them and to understand the effect of that on an associate producer or a producer whose whole livelihood is because he gets the right creative people to work with him, that if he wants a writer to work for him in the future in another production and he understands that because of what he does now, that writer is not going to work for him, that blacklisting threat has a tremendous effect on the producer in the future.It has an effect upon the director.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.462" offset="7125752">It has an effect upon all of these hyphenates and his conduct, to say that this kind of conduct does not engender fear in that supervisor, so that in the future when that union or any other union says to him to do something that the union wants, he is going to think that if he does not do what the union wants, he is going to have that same kind of punishment again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.540" offset="7242154">This adverse effect, certainly affects supervisors who in fact adjust writers grievances and we have evidence of some of the supervisors adjust writers grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.735" offset="7278934">It would affect supervisors who adjust grievances of other employees like directors because people do not just think about one union and what it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.910" offset="7323551">What one union can do another union can do and if the Writers Guild can cause writers not to work with an associate producer then the Directors Guild can cause Directors not to work with an associate producer and the director is very much concerned with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.612" offset="7386349">There is one bit of testimony in the record that just cries out, and Mr. Crichton who was talking with Mr. Furia, the leader of the Writers Guild and the President of the Writers Guild and Crichton is saying “I told him finally that if push came to shove, I would be rather be thrown out of the Writers Guild than the Directors Guild since I felt my future was really more with the Directors Guild” and he explained it was not that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.728" offset="7498885">If I were expelled from the Writers Guild I could not work as a Director in the future, work solely as a director because members of the Writers Guild could not work as Directors and me as a director if I have been thrown out of the Writers Guild.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.753" offset="7562937">That kind of threat has to have an adverse effect in the future and that adverse effect, that carryover effect does pertain to the selection of the representative for grievance handling and for a collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.100" offset="7624377">So, not just a question of identities the Guild would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.945" offset="7639737">What an employer wants, he wants the supervisor who will do what he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.464" offset="7661785">He wants a supervisor that will be tough with the union perhaps, if that is the way that particular employer wants, while the union buy this kind of discipline and threats can change that supervisor from a tough supervisor to a supervisor that agrees with the union and then they are in effect changing the identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.866" offset="7739421">Employers do not really care whether a supervisor has a black hair or red hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.817" offset="7759169">They do not care about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.722" offset="7762826">They care how he is going to perform with the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.350" offset="7825311">No, in fact I believe that is where the theory was originated from the language that I said Mr. Justice White, you were in the dissent in that case, but the majority did definitely state that plan, the discipline may adversely effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.829" offset="7883303">They are talking about the future there and that is the carryover effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.747" offset="7902947">That was not rejected by the Court in Florida Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.235" offset="7928861">Finally, one of the arguments that is relied on a great deal by the Guild is the argument that after Florida Power the loyalty of the supervisor member to its employer is irrelevant and without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.422" offset="8005661">And that language comes from the Court that says that it has a statement in Florida Power about loyalty not being a part of the remedy that Congress intended for the solution of the conflict over all these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.918" offset="8079639">Now, assuring loyalty is really one of the only purposes for 8 (b) (1) (B), why else would the Court put in 8 (b) (1) (B), why would the legislature put in 8 (b) (1) (B)?</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.145" offset="8132511">It is perfectly logical to have grievance handlers as the most senior person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.493" offset="8153932">Why not let the bargaining decide that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.544" offset="8162082">Well, the reason has to be because as I said earlier, that one of things that an employer wants other than competence and an articulate supervisor perhaps, but he wants the one who is loyal to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.714" offset="8206803">He wants the one that will do what he wants done in the handling of grievances in the collective bargaining, so the loyalty is still a part of 8 (b) (1) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.554" offset="8258212">Now, the respondent says that the only solution is to keep supervisor that has the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.196" offset="8284753">That solution really proves too much as the Court, as the Court again said there are instances where a supervisor does or a union does violate 8 (b) (1) (B) by adversely affecting the supervisor’s conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.152" offset="8360612">Now, the Court in Florida Power recognizes that there can be a situation where a supervisor member is threatened, is disciplined and that adversely affects his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.568" offset="8410245">We submit that this is that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.737" offset="8418918">With this kind of in terrorem conduct that Judge Moore said certainly these supervisors would be adversely affected and these employers would be deprived of their grievance handlers and collective bargainers and I would reserve the rest of time for Mr. Come's rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.809" offset="8731238">But what it is done from that Mr. Bakaly said that we have to start with Florida Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.341" offset="8761331">What the Board has done is end it with Florida Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.266" offset="8773034">What they have done is they taken Florida Power and limited it to its exact facts and that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.020" offset="8799992">They have taken a statement which says that supervisors may be disciplined for performing struck work and ended it there without any regard to this Court's rationale for the decision, without any regard for the legislative history, without any regard for the statutory language and all of that went to show that 8 (b) (1) (B) had a specific purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.236" offset="8900929">It was directed at curbing union interference with the selection by an employer of his representative for purposes of collective bargaining or adjusting of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.553" offset="8946173">Now, this Court made an extensive survey of the legislative history in Florida Power and the Board neither in this case nor in any of the cases that fall in Florida Power has gone to the legislative history to see where Florida Power should lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.481" offset="9041886">In fact, what this Court said and what the legislative history showed, is that while employers may have certain expectations from their supervisors, unions too have certain expectations from their members despite the fact those members may also be supervisors and in order to give the employers some relief from this conflict of loyalties, to help the employers to resolve this clash of expectations, Congress in 1947 simply took supervisors out from the under provisions of the Act by Section 23 and also absolved employers from the necessity to deal with supervisors or their representatives bargaining for them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2289.652" offset="9238536">And conferred upon employers the absolute right to have supervisors who are not union members and not to hire any supervisors who are union members, is that not correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. Julius Reich</label>
            <text syncTime="2297.106" offset="9268420">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.347" offset="9277301">The employers thus have at this point the ability to make their own decision to have their Supervisors not be members of the union, does not subject to that discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.764" offset="9339055">Now, the Board has come up with two theories in support of decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.403" offset="9365595">One of them is the deprivation theory in which the Board says that if a supervisor has an 8 (b) (1) (B) functions, that is he has the right to bargain collectively or the right to adjust grievances then it is sufficient if the union deprives the employer of the services of that supervisor regardless of the fact the supervisor is not performing 8 (b) (1) (B) functions while he is at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.915" offset="9487639">Now, with respect to those who were actually disciplined in this case, those were exactly the people who worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.323" offset="9517210">The employers were not deprived of the services of those persons, so they clearly were not restrained and coerced in the designation of those people who worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.435" offset="9557647">The Board to overcome that in its replied brief says yes, but they maybe afraid in the next strike to work and the employers will be restrained and coerced in the designation of their supervisors in the next strike, and therefore, it is a violation of the act, but the clear answer is that they can ask those supervisors to resign before the next strike comes up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2538.205" offset="10232756">An announcement was made that people can deal with him as they wish just to as in any strike situation, if a person crosses the picket line they suffer perhaps the enmity of their fellow workers, but if that is discipline then this Court has held in cases dealing with the reasonableness of the discipline by unions that, that is a matter for state court concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.401" offset="10357517">They certainly could have gone to a state court and get a declaration that, that discipline should not be erased from the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.851" offset="11859349">Now, what this does is to simply make a shambles of what this Court carefully told the Board it should distinguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.228" offset="11904906">The distinction between Section 211 functions which has supervisory functions and Section 8 (b) (1) (B) functions which are representative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.246" offset="11948896">There is a difference between a representative as that word is used in Section 8 (b) (1) (B) and a supervisor and the Board simply meshes them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.482" offset="11985886">Now, Congress could have simply said in 8 (b) (1) (B) that the union shall not restrain and coerce an employer in the selection of his supervisor and then the Board’s theory would make sense, but it did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.527" offset="12046072">It specifically said a representative, a representative for only two purposes and this Court recognized that in footnote 21 of the decision in Florida Power, may declare that there is a distinction between the two and there is only one function that of adjusting grievances which overlaps between Section 211 and 8 (b) (1) (B) and the Board’s argument proves too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.559" offset="12158189">There would be no basis upon which, if the Court accepted the Board's argument, that somebody with 8 (b) (1) (B) functions went to work and part of his work was that of doing rank-and-file struck work, the Board would have to say in those circumstances that the union cannot discipline him and cannot keep him from going to work because a person with authority to adjust grievances is being kept out of the plant and that would apply in the Florida Power situation just as it would apply in our situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.775" offset="12347003">We have a case of the tail wagging the dog here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.574" offset="12362258">The result is, what the Board says is that all the employer has to do is designate a person as its representative and that person can freely go through the picket line and disavow his obligations to his union despite the fact that he never adjusted a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.298" offset="12429132">We have an example at page 132 of the appendix for example of a person who has asked of one of his supervisors, who was asked, do you adjust grievances and he said I have the authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3398.242" offset="13672874">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.089" offset="13696279">In Florida Power &amp; Light Mr. Justice Stewart noted that the Board’s view of Section 8 (b) (1) (B) had evolved to the point that it served as a “general prohibition of the unions, disciplining supervisor members for their conduct in the course of representing the interest of their employer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.063" offset="13780185">I suggest that as Mr. Come made quite clear, the Board has continued to hue to that view with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.040" offset="13816129">They now say that in a situation in which the supervisor member performs a substantial amount of rank-and-file work, some of which is struck work that the union can discipline the supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.912" offset="13911633">We suggest that that analysis is no more responsive to the statute and its legislative history than the broad position taken before this Court the last time this question was here because as Mr. Reich indicated, at the end of his argument, it is our position that assuming that Oakland Mailers is correct, namely assuming that the Section does not simply protect employers against strikes against them, but protects supervisors against discipline for performing certain functions for the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.294" offset="14093132">Section 8 (b) (1) (B) is given the full scope that it can possibly be given so long as it is a violation for the Union to discipline the supervisor for performing 8 (b) (1) (B) functions or because of the way he performs those 8 (b) (1) (B) functions, but that the union has a privilege which Congress did not choose to take away of disciplining supervisor members for performing any non-8 (b) (1) (B) functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.299" offset="14221132">We think that line is that so long as the cause is the way the supervisor performs his 8 (b) (1) (B) function, assuming as I said that the Oakland Mailers is correctly decided, the Union commits a violation, but that if the union’s discipline is based on the way the supervisor performs other supervisory duties or rank-and-file duties or the fact that it crosses the picket line and thereby tends to undermine the strike, that is outside the prohibition of this unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.997" offset="14363969">At that point, the employer’s option, again to quote from Florida Power &amp; Light is to force the supervisor to resign from the union, thereby protecting his interest and we think that the source of this understanding is basically on three different facets of the Act and its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.653" offset="14506598">First of all, Section 8 (b) (1) (B) is far narrower than Section 211.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.900" offset="14539512">Section 8 (b) (1) (B) protects employers in their selections of grievance handlers and negotiators whereas Section 211 defines supervisors far more broadly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3703.764" offset="14894986">The more difficult and controversial issue of whether to restrict the right of supervisors to be union members was solved through Section 14 and 211 and 23 in favor of giving the employer a privilege to keep supervisors out of unions, to fire supervisors who joined unions and to refuse to bargain with unions about supervisory units, even where the union had majority support in the union, thereby reversing the decision in the Packard Motor Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.216" offset="15084844">It is not surprising I would contend that the sponsors of 23, 211 and 14 did not choose to give supervisor members protection in law against discipline as supervisors because they were at the same time stripping those supervisor members of all legal protection vis-a-vis the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="4192.509" offset="16849990">And the Board, of course read 883 to create a prophylactic rule that an employer could never lock out, and the theory of that court opinion was that where Congress leaves the privilege on the one hand and creates a prohibition on the other, the Board can prohibit activity motivated, wrongfully motivated, but cannot prohibit all of activity which has adverse effect on the ground that that is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.410" offset="16993559">And I would suggest that here too, if Oakland Mailers is correct, the Board has moved to protect the supervisor in performing 8 (b) (1) (B) functions to assure that a union cannot discipline the supervisor for the way he performs that function or for the fact that he is performing to go the next step and say it is necessary or else, employers will believe, I mean that supervisors will believe that they can be disciplined for 8 (b) (1) (B) functions to assure that they are not disciplined for anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.426" offset="17133680">We believe it is impermissible because we think that it cuts into the privilege that Congress left which was to fine or otherwise discipline supervisor members for activities other than 8 (b) (1) (B) functions and that is why we believe that both they so called carryover theory and the deprivation theories are unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.560" offset="17254157">The Board has a direct method of protecting supervisor members who are disciplined for performing 8 (b) (1) (B) activities, that is to make it an unfair labor practice to so discipline it to say that in order to protect them you must go one step further and assure that they can be disciplined for anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="4824.006" offset="19375927">Suppose in an employee strike, you had a group of rank-and-file employees across the picket line and then the supervisor crossed the picket line to supervise them, would you feel that this made this a different case?</text>

            <text syncTime="4924.998" offset="19779989">I think in terms of the policy that went behind Florida Power, it also made a big difference that only rank-and-file work was involved because that to deprive the union of the right to discipline people for performing that truly cut at the heart of the union strike weapon and in view of the Insurance Agents and Curtis in Section 13, this Court has made it clear that absent clear indication from Congress that it intends to so limit, it is not going to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.105" offset="19944351">I think that when you get to the performance of supervisory work as you had here, the balance is a different one and I think that there is that policy difference, but getting to the last argument that my brother made that the burden is on the supervisor or the Board to show that the supervisor was not in fact performing grievance adjustment or collective bargaining work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.087" offset="20148315">It is not only an unreal situation, but it is not required by the statute because the statute prescribes restraining and coercing the employer in the selection of his representative for a grievance adjustment and collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.011" offset="20223966">We submit that when the employer selects a supervisor with those posts and directs him to come to work in a situation where there is a potential for exercising those powers, it is as much an interference with the employer selection, if you deprive him of that representative's authority, whether he in fact was called upon on a particular day to adjust grievances or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.584" offset="20398255">Because in the real world there is no way of knowing exactly when a grievance is going to arise or a collective bargaining situation is going to arise and certainly a supervisor does not cease to be become any less the management selected representative for that purpose due to the fortuity that on a particular hour or a particular day he did not have a grievance to adjust.</text>

            <text syncTime="5201.369" offset="20885386">I think this case is an easy case because there was no history of the supervisor is doing any bargaining unit, struck work and there was no requirement that they perform any and as a matter of fact the employers made it perfectly clear that they would not require them to do any writing that was covered by the bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="5438.480" offset="21833840">And the position of the Board majority and the position that I am urging here is that under Florida Power, you can affect the employer selection of his representative for these purposes, merely by threatening to discipline employee or supervisors if they cross the picket line to perform their supervisory duties where they include these functions and it does not have to be for the manner in which they performed any particular grievance adjustment or collective bargaining matter.</text>
