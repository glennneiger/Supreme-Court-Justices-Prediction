            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80003">The judgment and opinion of the Court in 76-558, Raymond Motor Transports against Wisconsin, and the 76-635, United States Steel Corporation against Multi State Tax Commission will each be announced by Mr. Justice Powell.</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="23.206" offset="172790">In first of these cases, 76-558, Raymond Motor Transport against Rice, we have an appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. Appellants, two intrastate trucking companies, challenge administrative regulations of the Wisconsin Highway Commission on the ground that they unreasonably burden intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.873" offset="271428">The regulations prevent appellants from operating trucks that are 65 feet long and pull two trailers on four-lane divided highways within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.673" offset="318658">Neighboring states allow these trucks and trailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.096" offset="336316">Because of the Wisconsin regulations, appellants intrastate operations into and across Wisconsin are disrupted, costs are raised and services slowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.041" offset="384068">The state defended the regulations on safety grounds, but it produced no evidence that the regulations actually contribute to highway safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.727" offset="426909">Appellants on the other hand produced substantial evidence that the longer trucks are as safe as other trucks that the state routinely allows to be operated on its highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.570" offset="482184">In an opinion filed today with a clerk, we hold that the regulations do unreasonably burden intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.675" offset="514681">We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.461" offset="533802">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justices Brennan and Rehnquist have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.674" offset="570687">Mr. Justice Stevens did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
