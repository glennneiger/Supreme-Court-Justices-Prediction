            <label>Justice John Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="14.657" offset="138610">The Santa Clara case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.654" offset="170584">There a female member of the Santa Clara Indian tribe sued the tribe and its Governor, claiming that a tribal rule excluding from membership, the children of certain female members violated the Indian Civil Rights Act 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.406" offset="245607">The Court of Appeals held that a cause of action for the declaratory injunction relief though not expressly provided for, was implicit in the act, and concluded that the membership rule was in violation of its substantive provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.819" offset="311227">In the opinion filed with the clerk, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.516" offset="325960">The Indian Civil Rights Act does not on its face purport to subject tribes to the jurisdiction of Federal Court in suits of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.584" offset="362322">Accordingly, we hold that the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity preclude civil actions in Federal District Courts against an Indian tribe for alleged violations of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.041" offset="412060">We further conclude that the Indian Civil Rights Act was not intended implicitly to authorize causes of actions for declaratory and injunctive relief against tribal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.128" offset="464409">The structure of the act demonstrates that Congress had dual objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.624" offset="490427">One that protecting the individual rights of tribal members, while at the same time promoting tribal self government.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.238" offset="524909">Implication of a cause of action would be inconsistent with the latter goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.522" offset="546015">Moreover Congress consider and rejected various proposals for Federal Review of tribal action in both civil and criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.573" offset="586244">In light of this history, Congress' faith in authorized actions, other than Habeas Corpus, indicates that it would not have intended the Courts to infer additional remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.586" offset="638280">Recognizing the anomalous nature of our relation with the Indian tribes, and Congress has extraordinarily broad authority in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.379" offset="673493">We conclude that the court's below erred in finding a cause of action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.127" offset="696481">Mr. Justice Rehnquist joins only in part one, two, four and five of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.910" offset="719573">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration of the decision of this case.</text>
