            <label>Mr. George A. Nilson</label>
            <text syncTime="28.342" offset="193240">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.137" offset="204420">I am here seeking reversal of the opinion of the Three Judge Federal Court below which held that Maryland’s juvenile justice system of delinquency hearings before masters with review available from the Juvenile Court judge by way of exception offends the constitutional bar against Double Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.855" offset="267323">Under Maryland’s present statutes and rules governing Juvenile Court proceedings, most of the more populous local jurisdictions in Maryland as well as some of the rural counties employ masters for the purpose of conducting various hearings within the Juvenile Court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.708" offset="318732">The utilization of these masters which also characterizes the juvenile justice systems of approximately 34 other states is designed both to assist the Circuit Court system in dealing with the extremely heavy caseload in the juvenile area and also to provide for the involvement in the process of persons who by virtue of their interests, expertise and permanent assignment to the Juvenile Court system can bring to bear in the disposition of juvenile clauses a familiarity with and sensitivity to the special needs and problems of juveniles charged with committing acts in violation of the state’s criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.515" offset="453942">Under Maryland’s system, the Juvenile Court judge hears originally all petitions for waiver of jurisdiction to the Criminal Courts for trial as adults and also generally hears originally the more aggravated charges such as murder, rape or armed robbery as well as cases where exceptions to a master’s proposal are anticipated in advance of the proceedings. With certain other limited exceptions, other delinquency cases including arraignment, detention, adjudication and disposition, maybe assigned for the hearing of evidence to one of the full time masters employed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.537" offset="598033">Under both the statute and under Maryland Rule 911, when a master conducts an adjudicatory and a disposition hearing, he is required to transmit his proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations and proposed disposition orders to the Juvenile Court judge within 10 days of the conclusion of the disposition hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.306" offset="693119">In Baltimore city, there is one judge and seven masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.429" offset="705658">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.357" offset="713390">In the other counties, the ratio, more closely approximates one to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.880" offset="727392">The figures both as to judges and masters I think are given in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.336" offset="745260">Both the statute and the rule provide that these proposed findings, conclusions and recommendations do not constitute orders or final action of the Court and that final adjudication and disposition orders are only entered by the Juvenile Court judge following his consideration of any exceptions which may be filed within five days or if no exceptions are filed, following his concurrence in the master’s recommendations if he agrees with them.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="192.733" offset="850899">What would happen under Maryland Law if the master simply by mistake failed to transmit his findings to the Juvenile Court judge?</text>
            <text syncTime="200.756" offset="882977">Could the state go out and incarcerate the juvenile on the basis of the master’s finding?</text>

            <label>Mr. George A. Nilson</label>
            <text syncTime="207.135" offset="908473">He could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.805" offset="911189">There would be no order of the Court on the basis of which the state could act.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.098" offset="928326">There would have been no disposition of that case, if there had been no transmittal of the findings and no order entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.327" offset="957269">The only officer in the Court system with the power to enter an order, disposing of the case and providing for a disposition of that juvenile is the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.492" offset="997916">Now, in terms of the submission of recommendations and findings while as I have just indicated the rule and the statute do require that those recommendations and the findings of fact be transmitted to the judge, that is frequently waived by the parties and this is pointed out on a number of occasions in the appellee’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.856" offset="1083389">That occurs in situations where the parties essentially are acquiescing in the master’s proposed disposition of the case which he announces at the hearing and they will say to the master -- Pardon me.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="260.605" offset="1122363">Still an order is entered signed by the judge in those cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.738" offset="1138873">Signed by the judge?</text>

            <label>Mr. George A. Nilson</label>
            <text syncTime="265.631" offset="1142425">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.488" offset="1149844">While understandably a few recommendations are disturbed by the Juvenile Court judge in the absence of exceptions by either the state or the juvenile, the judge does have the authority sue sponte to either remands the master for further hearing to himself hold a further non-evidentiary hearing or to himself hold a supplemental evidentiary hearing if both the state and the juvenile agree to the taking of additional evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.097" offset="1244303">This case focuses on the Double Jeopardy implications of the review of the master’s recommendation upon the filing of exceptions thereto by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.353" offset="1277322">Appellees argue that regardless of the basis for the exceptions, and regardless of whether additional evidence is heard by the judge with a consent of all parties including the juvenile or whether the judge's review is solely on the record, the juvenile is placed in jeopardy at the evidentiary, adjudicatory hearing before the master that, that jeopardy concludes upon the filing of the master’s recommendations and that any consideration given by way of review of the Juvenile Court judge upon the filing with exception by the state to a master’s recommendation of a non-delinquency finding, constitutes a new and impermissible second jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.684" offset="1418696">Obviously, the state disagrees with all of the elements of that position taken by the Appellees.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.792" offset="1715134">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.108" offset="1724329">I think, Judge Hammerman was the Juvenile Judge in Baltimore city for some eight years and then Judge Karwacki and there is evidence from both of those two judges in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.517" offset="1761945">The Appellee’s initial attack on the Maryland system culminated in the decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals in matter of Anderson in 1974, because there are several prior proceedings in this case relevant, I thought it best to just describe them briefly to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.479" offset="1817847">In that case, certain juveniles challenged the provisions of what was then Maryland Rule 908 and is now 911, which will authorize the state to file exceptions to a master’s recommendation of non-delinquency contending there that the provision for a de novo hearing before the Juvenile Court judge violated applicable Double Jeopardy principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.652" offset="1886497">At that time the rules did permit a de novo hearing upon exception by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.935" offset="1911679">Assuming in correct anticipation of this Court’s subsequent decision in Breed v. Jones the Double Jeopardy principles apply to adjudications of delinquency in Juvenile Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.415" offset="1949609">Maryland’s Court of Appeals rejected the challenge to the rule permitting exceptions by the state on the grounds that the juvenile master is a ministerial and not a judicial officer that under the Maryland Constitution he is entrusted with no part of the judicial power of the state, that his recommendations are only that and do not become binding unless and until approved by the judge and that accordingly, the hearing before the master is not such a hearing that places a juvenile in jeopardy at the time that hearing occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.879" offset="2067473">Following that decision, review of which was denied by this Court for want of a substantial federal question, the Appellees file this case and a companion habeas corpus petition in the US District Court for the District of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.446" offset="2109687">The habeas cases were heard and decided first resulting in an opinion in June of 1975 in Aldridge v. Dean concluding that the ability of the state to file exceptions to the master’s finding and to obtain a de novo adjudicatory hearing before a judge again under the former version of the Maryland rule, violated the rights of juveniles not to be twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.275" offset="2193070">Immediately following the decision of the habeas cases, the Maryland Court of Appeals adopted amended Juvenile Court rules which explicitly confirmed the holding in matter of Anderson that the master’s recommendations are proposed only and are not binding or final orders of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.596" offset="2250331">The new rules also denied to the state when it takes exception to the master’s recommendation, the opportunity to adduce any new evidence before the Juvenile Court judge without the consent of the juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.766" offset="2290977">Moreover the Juvenile Court statute effective July 1, ’75 required for the first time that proceedings before the masters be recorded, thus making possible meaningful review by the Juvenile Court Judge on the record developed before the master.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.623" offset="2346461">Appellees then filed a supplemental complaint in this case alleging the violation of Double Jeopardy not withstanding the changes in the rules, additional evidence was introduced and the opinion below followed in September of ’77.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.717" offset="4026762">The employment of intake officers in these mode, it is common in many states and as I said it is used frequently in Maryland and there are many cases that are disposed off by these intake officers who are not lawyers, not masters, not judges before the case ever gets up to even the master stage or the judge stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.900" offset="4103562">A very large percentage of today’s high volume of juvenile matters are disposed off through that intake process and thus never get before for any kind of an adjudicatory hearing before a master or a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.789" offset="4159046">The state’s first argument on the question of when jeopardy attaches is both set forth in the first part of our brief and is reflected as I indicated before in the Maryland Court of Appeals decision in matter of Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.682" offset="4206693">It represents the approach adopted by several other State Courts which have considered this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.683" offset="4226651">Rather than attempt to fully restate that portion of our argument, I would like to simply focus on the implications of this Court’s decision in Breed v. Jones relative to that particular argument and this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.952" offset="4271686">The holding in Breed was of course limited to the proposition that once a Juvenile Court finds that a juvenile has committed acts that violated Criminal Law, the juvenile has been put in jeopardy and cannot thereafter be waived to the Adult Criminal Court system for trial because such a criminal trial would constitute a second and impermissible jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.893" offset="4343470">In its opinion in Breed, this Court made no distinction between the respective roles of Juvenile Court referee and Juvenile Court judge in the California proceedings there at issue but referred throughout to the actions of the Juvenile Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.119" offset="4392371">Under the California system, dispositions proposed by referees do not require the affirmative concurrence of the Juvenile Court Judge but become final upon the failure of the judge to disturb them within 20 days following the hearing before the referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.971" offset="4447855">This Court did not consider or discuss in Breed, the relative roles of the referee and the judge since there was no need for it to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.404" offset="4477531">Appellees have correctly pointed out in their brief that an examination of the record in Breed indicates that the adjudicatory hearing which occurred in that case was in fact held before a referee rather than a judge and from this, they have argued that the clear implication, if not the expressed holding of Breed is that jeopardy attached in that case at the moment evidence was first presented to the California Juvenile Court referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.995" offset="4571885">While this Court could so conclude, if and when expressly presented with a question, we submit that the question was not presented or decided in Breed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.508" offset="4605949">In essence, it is our position that the question of when jeopardy attaches in a Juvenile Court proceeding should be answered as I indicated earlier by holding that it attaches when evidence is first presented to that officer of the Court who has the authority to decide factual questions and to dispose off the case by a finding of delinquency or non-delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.645" offset="4686510">Whatever the precise point in time at which jeopardy attaches in the California system might be, we submit that the point in time at which jeopardy attaches in Maryland is when the recommendations of the master are presented to and considered by the Juvenile Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.912" offset="4739591">The fact that the master is previously presided of evidentiary hearing and formulated his own proposed findings should not have to be held to have accelerated the point in time at which jeopardy attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.303" offset="4785149">Surely, the mere fact that evidence is presented before the master should not result in a holding that jeopardy attaches when that occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.691" offset="4810644">What is critical is the presentation of evidence to the trier of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.821" offset="4839170">The second part of the argument as I indicated before is premised on an assumption that the Court should hold that jeopardy did begin to attach at that first hearing and it is our position that that the limited review by the Juvenile Court judge of the master’s recommendation upon the filing an exception at that point does not constitute a second and impermissible jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.994" offset="4923911">When that exception has been filed, there has been at that point in time no adjudication of acquittal or its equivalent such as would constitute a termination of the initial jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.737" offset="4962886">Regardless of the subjective perception and sense of relief that the juvenile upon hearing the master’s proposed or recommended disposition of the case in his favor may have, the fact of the matter is that the master’s recommendation is nothing more than advisory of the Court and is not final unless and until approved by the Juvenile Court Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.899" offset="5043552">The correctness of that assertion is not altered in the least by the fact that master’s recommendations are generally adopted by the judge in the absence of exceptions by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.470" offset="5085766">Appellees in their brief have made a great deal out of the fact that the judges approve the vast majority of master’s recommendations that are presented before them and move from that to argue that the judges are a mere rubber stamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.903" offset="5139578">In the first place, I think it is terribly important for this Court to understand several things about the facts that the Appellees have brought to bear in dealing with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.080" offset="5168208">Number one, they are talking about situations where no exceptions are filed to the master’s recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.108" offset="5196316">Therefore, it is natural that the judge would be inclined to accept and approve most of those recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.733" offset="5218886">Also, in the bulk of those cases, both parties have even waived the requirement that the master prepared detailed written findings to submit to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.262" offset="5256920">I think it also must be borne in mind that the figures and the information in the record with respect to the amount of time spent by the Juvenile Court Judge in reviewing master’s recommendations predate the current rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.230" offset="5312822">The testimony of judge Karwacki which is included in the Appendix filed in this case indicates that the judges do do a conscientious style of reviewing those cases that are presented to the judges with written recommendations from the masters and do on occasion listen to the recordings which are now made of the testimony and the proceedings before the master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.485" offset="5393906">Maryland rules provide that prior to the time that the judge enters an order either the state or the juvenile may note an exemption to the master’s recommendation and have the matter considered by the judge before a final disposition of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.671" offset="5454615">When a juvenile notes an exception, the rule provides that he may elect either a hearing de novo or a hearing before the judge on the record established before the master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.097" offset="5488260">When the state notes an exception, the controlling rule now assures to the juvenile his right to insist if he wishes that the judge consider the case solely on the basis of the record which was made before the master and which caused the master to recommend in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.101" offset="5544371">Alternatively, additional evidence may be presented to the judge but only if he considers it relevant, and if both the state and the juvenile consent to its introduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.102" offset="5580316">Thus, the juvenile is able to prevent the state from presenting evidence which it did not present before the master or from retrying its case again before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.248" offset="5616887">This is not a situation where there are separate proceedings before different tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.832" offset="5635277">Each of which can result in an adjudication for or against the juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.492" offset="5653877">There is only one proceeding before the Juvenile Court which consists of the presentation of evidence before and the issue of recommendations to the Court by the master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.130" offset="5692433">The final determination of the matter on behalf of the Juvenile Court by the judge either following his consideration of any exceptions filed or following his concurrence in the recommendation of the master in the absence of exceptions, if he chooses to concur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.985" offset="5747813">The state's contention that the proceedings in Maryland Juvenile Courts are continuous in nature and involve only a single jeopardy, does not require this Court to now adopt the type of continuing jeopardy theory articulated first by Mr. Justice Holmes in Kepner v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.078" offset="5812283">Holmes in continuing jeopardy view clearly involves situations where the criminal justice process is punctuated by adjudications of innocent or guilt and thereafter proceeds to a contrary determination or a subsequent trial with the potential for producing another adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.108" offset="5888352">Here, the process is not so punctuated because the Maryland rules provide that the first and only adjudication cannot and does not occur until after the completion of the entire process when the Juvenile Court judge enters an appropriate order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.661" offset="5954598">When the judge entertains an exception filed by the state to the master’s recommendation, he does so not in the context of a separate and distinct proceeding but as the final stage in a single continuous proceeding.</text>

Witnesses testify, cross examine, arguments, motions, legal points, exhibits, the whole bit, all pursuant to the procedural requirements that have been outlined by this Court in Gault, Winship and to some extent in Breed, although the first two obviously are the most relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.588" offset="6602226">At the end of it, the master considers his decision and he reviews the facts and the law and he says, Johnny, I find you not guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.827" offset="7287261">What I am saying is the record clearly supports this that the master explains it in the typical criminal lingo because obviously a child is not going to understand the words delinquent or non-delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.809" offset="7339193">Now after the decision, after without trying to assume the conclusion after the master makes the statement and the child and his parent leaves, the state's attorney decides that he was not satisfied with the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.563" offset="7410141">He thought the child should have been found guilty and so what does he do, he files an exception and he then goes, takes out exception and files it with the clerk and there was then another hearing before the judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.355" offset="7557367">A new fact finder and this time, a new fact finder whether it is with new evidence which is what the statute provides or the same evidence or at least the tape recording of the evidence floor master.

            <text syncTime="2929.918" offset="11799549">If I might for just a minute turn to the law in our case, we are making two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.104" offset="11824313">The first is that there is a first jeopardy that attaches and that it attaches at the commencement of the master’s hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.606" offset="11854301">Now I submit and it is elaborated in our brief that the decision of this Court in Jones v. Breed explicitly so holds, it was the master in Jones v. Breed, jeopardy attached at the start and it is simply not true as the state pointed out that in California, the master or the referee as they call him there has the power to sign an order when a child is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.028" offset="11967986">He does not have the power at all, when a child is taken out of the home that must be affirmatively signed by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.562" offset="12010200">Therefore, in our view Jones v. Breed squarely decides the first issue that the state has raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.723" offset="12042801">Remember the state has got two arguments, the first is that Jeopardy never attaches at all and therefore there cannot be a second one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3206.820" offset="12907245">That is correct although, I might say that the parties in this case involve -- plaintiffs in Baltimore city and defendant state’s attorney from Baltimore city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.844" offset="12939323">The second half and the reason what admittedly is not covered in terms by Jones v. Breed is whether there is a second jeopardy that attaches when the case goes before the judge and we think that there is for two different -- alternatively for two reasons, either because the hearing before the master, despite the fact that he has not signed his name is sufficiently final for Double Jeopardy purposes when you consider that it was a trial, when you consider what Double Jeopardy is all about and when you consider the realities of the system, in which case of course, it would be a second jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.451" offset="13093759">If it is not final, surely, there is only one alternative and that is that it is not final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.118" offset="13116433">If it is not final, we suggest that it nonetheless is a Double Jeopardy because how does it come to be a second trial before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.175" offset="13156662">It comes to be there because the state prevents the matter from going to its logical conclusion, which as we all know is going to be the stroke of a pen and indeed was in several of these cases, the judge mistakenly signed the order early of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.492" offset="13229909">Instead because the state’s attorney says no, I want another crack, that does not happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.424" offset="13337638">At least five days has to go by, Mr. Justice Stevens because that is the time that the party has to decided whether he wants to take an exception and normally it would be immediately thereafter if as is virtually always the case written findings and conclusions are waived, so normally the answer would be five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.990" offset="13407855">When it goes before the judge at the second trial, whether it be on the record or de novo, in our view, that could only be justified by an exception to the normal Double Jeopardy rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.828" offset="13463235">Obviously, the Ball exception has no application here and nor does the Barkus exception so what we are talking about is the Perez, Denits(ph) exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.334" offset="13509211">Denits(ph) does not have any application either really so it is the Perez exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.996" offset="13527914">Our position is that this does not represent manifest necessity to prevent the trial from going to its conclusion because that is exactly what happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.248" offset="13572949">Because he did not like the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.926" offset="13583607">The master believed the child was not guilty and he wants to goad again before judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.679" offset="13602624">The necessary part of your argument as I now understand it Mr. Smith is that in the line share of cases after a master has recommended a finding of non-delinquency that judge does rubber stamp it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.411" offset="13661557">That has to be part of your argument which you are now making.</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.767" offset="13679006">It is part of our argument but if I can just have 30 seconds to conclude this point, if jeopardy did attach the first time, there has got to be some reason for concluding that there is an exception to saying that it did not attach a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.679" offset="13762598">The continuing jeopardy doctrine, of course, has been rejected by this Court consistently right up to the present and the only way that we can see that you can say that a second jeopardy does not attach is to claim that its manifest necessity and yet the very heart of this Court’s manifest necessity decisions is that for the state’s attorney to say, I am not satisfied with the result is not manifest necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.729" offset="13878791">Briefly if I may use the few minutes to clarify several factual points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.750" offset="13894882">In the colloquy with Mr. Smith the question came up earlier on in his argument about what is said and how it is said by the master at the conclusion of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.723" offset="13934797">I would agree with some of the comments which indicated that that does not or may not have a terribly significant bearing on the legal outcome but I think the record clearly establishes that in many cases, the master specifically advises the juvenile that the state does have the opportunity to take exception even where the master does --</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.549" offset="14050154">He does not have the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.089" offset="14056319">In fact, whatever he says but I do not think that this Court should be laboring under the impression that in all cases, he overstates his authority because that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.515" offset="14101981">The record indicates that in many instances, the juveniles are specifically informed by the master that the state has the ability to take exceptions to the master’s proposals and when they are not told by the master, they are told by their own counsel because all of the juveniles at these hearings are represented by counsel by and large by the pubic defenders office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.852" offset="14171362">The subject of detention came up and the question of what action the master could take with respect to detention at the time the adjudicatory hearing was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.864" offset="14207411">The master at that time as at other times does have the authority to order interim detention of the juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.479" offset="14233847">There is nothing special about that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.722" offset="14242833">There is no special privilege or prerogative that the master has at that time to order detention as opposed to some other time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.139" offset="14312528">Mr. Smith has gone on at great length about the perfunctory nature of the judge’s review of the master’s recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.251" offset="14344920">Again, as it has been pointed out, this case involves cases which go up on exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.420" offset="14365609">They are heard, they are argued, they are considered extensively by the judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.575" offset="14382223">They are not perfunctorily reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.944" offset="14391731">The other cases as to which no exceptions are filed, I would urge this Court to the extent that it feels that how those cases were handled to look at page 49 of the Appendix which is the stipulation of judge Karwacki, not as Mr. Smith indicated one minute per case but a minimum of 15 to 20 minutes per case sometimes hours, sometimes listing to the recording, this again, in cases where none of the parties are taking exceptions, not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.520" offset="14506043">Mr. Smith also in talking about part one of our argument on the question of when jeopardy attached indicated that the state has changed its position from what it was in the brief and said that in the brief, we referred to the time at which the matter is heard before the master upon the taking of exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.765" offset="14575006">Yes, that is the way we described it in the brief because perhaps we were making the mistake of focusing at that point on what this case is all about, cases where exceptions are taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.850" offset="14615340">There is no difference between the state’s position in the brief and at argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.419" offset="14629550">It is when the case gets before the judge we say that jeopardy attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.074" offset="14648254">When an exception is taken, that is when the exception is presented to the judge and the case is heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.198" offset="14668734">In the other case, in the lion’s share of other cases, it is when the file goes before the judge with the master’s recommendation.</text>
