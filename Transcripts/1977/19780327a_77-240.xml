            <label>Mr. Sidney S. Rosdeitcher</label>
            <text syncTime="17.619" offset="150423">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.288" offset="165052">This case raises for the first time, a question of interpretation of a central portion of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.611" offset="202355">Specifically, under Section 2(b) of that Act, Congress withdrew the Sherman Act and other federal Anti-Trust laws from the business of insurance, if the states enacted regulatory legislation specifically provides that the Sherman Act and other Anti-Trust Law shall apply to the business of insurance to the extent not regulated by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.959" offset="307785">Under Section 3(b) of the Act, Congress provided an exception to this policy of deference to state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.820" offset="347177">It provided that Federal Regulation under the Sherman Act would be reserved and would continue to apply in cases of boycott, coercion, or intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.839" offset="403288">In this case, we contend that the First Circuit Court of Appeals interpreted that exception so expansively that it nullified the policy of Section 2(b) to withdraw the Sherman Act and the Anti-Trust laws in most cases from the business of insurance where the states enacted regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.300" offset="493150">This afternoon, I hope to demonstrate that the result reached by the first Circuit was unnecessary that it was not required by what the First Circuit believed was the plain meaning of the phrase “boycott, coercion, and intimidation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="117.321" offset="549261">That the history of the Act and the use of those terms in this Court marked out a more reasonable boundary line which would have preserved and given meaning to both Section 3(b) and Section 2(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="135.203" offset="620732">Before I turn to the specific facts of this case, I would like if you will, to give a very brief history which I think will put those facts and issues in this case in perspective. For more than a century, the regulation of the business of insurance and particularly the relationship between the policy holder and the insurance company was assumed to be and was totally within the hands of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.503" offset="737969">In 1944, this Court in South-Eastern Underwriters’ case held that at least one set of Federal Regulation would apply to the business of insurance namely the Sherman Act, and the federal Anti-Trust laws. In the following year, 1945, Congress reacted to that decision and it enacted the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.655" offset="842564">This Court has already said that the purpose of that statute was to place the force of federal law behind state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.997" offset="871925">It specifically recognizes that it is in the public interest that state regulation of insurance be the policy in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.793" offset="907138">And finally, as this Court has said, the purpose of the statute was to turn back the clock in most part to where it stood prior to South-Easter Underwriters and placed the regulation of insurance and leave the regulation of the policyholder, insurance company relationship particularly in the hands of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.381" offset="997417">This case raises an issue about one portion of that congressional endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.038" offset="1028137">As I said, it relates to the decision of Congress to withdraw the Sherman Act from the business of insurance with an exception for boycotts, coercion, and intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.242" offset="1076934">The tension between those two provisions is presented starkly in this case and let me briefly recite the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.339" offset="1121342">The plaintiffs are two groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.877" offset="1127403">They purport to bring a Class Action on behalf of doctors in Rhode Island and patients of those doctors or future patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.063" offset="1160213">The doctors claim that they were insured by the St. Paul Fire and Marine and that for sometime they were getting an insurance policy whose terms they were satisfied with essentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.806" offset="1199187">A policy known as an occurrence basis policy which provides briefly that the claim will be paid by the insurance company for any event which occurred during the term of the policy whether or not the claim is made at a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.158" offset="1260627">Sometime in April 1975, St. Paul announced to its insureds that it would not renew those policies on that basis but would renew only on a so-called claims-made basis which limited the liability of the company by providing that it would only pay for claims submitted during the term on claims which arose during the term of the policy.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="320.771" offset="1363027">In fact, had it been used by the insurance industry before this time?</text>

            <text syncTime="324.859" offset="1379432">I am not sure whether it had been used by the insurance industry before this time elsewhere; it had not been used by these companies at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.429" offset="1417675">The doctor said they were dissatisfied with this policy and that they went to three other companies, my client Aetna, Hartford, and Travelers, and that those companies would not sell them any insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.059" offset="1468144">They then filed this action.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Sidney S. Rosdeitcher</label>
            <text syncTime="349.437" offset="1477653">They said they would not sell them any insurance at all, then filed this action under the Federal Anti-Trust Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.067" offset="1516209">Now if I stop there, before getting to the question of boycott, I will go back to what I said as to why this case starkly raises the tension between Section 2(b) and 3(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="370.549" offset="1562185">To start with, this case plainly involves the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.783" offset="1583083">It is the very essence of the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.703" offset="1594786">The question is what kind of policies the companies are willing to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.822" offset="1607220">At what terms, what policies would be issued?</text>
            <text syncTime="387.036" offset="1628118">Rhode Island regulated the business of insurance extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.407" offset="1641597">Everybody accepted this but it is worth considering how they did regulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.754" offset="1658942">They not only had a statute aimed at anti-competitive practice passed in direct response in McCarran Act, but at the very time, we had what looks like a race to see who can get there first.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.368" offset="1713381">Consider the events April 18, 1975; St. Paul makes its announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.457" offset="1729786">Somewhere in between on specifying the complaint, these plaintiffs decide that there was some kind of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.291" offset="1757058">June 1, 1975, the first complaint in this action is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.371" offset="1773463">June 16, 1975, Rhode Island commences the Joint Underwriting Association designed to takeover the business of insurance and deal with some of the very problems which are dealt with here, namely the so-called Medical Malpractice Insurance crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.418" offset="1841590">So we have the spectacle of a Federal Court action on the one hand began directed at what they claim is a conspiracy as the cause of this crisis.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.535" offset="1882133">I was wondering why you used the term crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.983" offset="1899896">Is it because the cost of it becomes so prohibitive or because of other consequences?</text>

            <text syncTime="462.094" offset="1928317">I call it a crisis first because the Rhode Island Administrator who issued the regulation shortly after the action began called it a crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.872" offset="1963426">I think it was a crisis because there was difficulty and I think it is fairly well known although it is not in the record that there has been difficulty in obtaining Medical Malpractice Insurance that rates have gone very high, what the cause is for that are not the subject to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.083" offset="2024239">In our view, what the causes were are matters to be determined by the State of Rhode Island and we think Rhode Island did --</text>

            <text syncTime="491.520" offset="2046077">And then you were using the term crisis with respect to Rhode Island not on a national crisis or?</text>

            <text syncTime="497.294" offset="2069169">I think if I may, I think there probably was at that time a national crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.501" offset="2089963">There is a list of statutes in one of the amicus briefs that something like 37 states, I believe, have enacted similar type of Joint Underwriting Associations to deal with the problem of the availability and the cost of malpractice insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.702" offset="2150776">So that to the extent that it is widespread, it is a national crisis whether everybody views it as such, I am not sure.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.535" offset="2678136">And so there would be no need for state regulation and that would be sufficient to exempt it from the Anti-Trust Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="660.082" offset="2720245">They could have done this and I think let me review what they did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.013" offset="2731948">They passed the statute which was directed at unfair methods and anti competitive methods of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.115" offset="2764444">They defined certain of those methods including boycott, coercion, and intimidation which they outlawed and then they left to the commissioner the same kind of power that the Federal Trade Commission has to define anti-competitor practices as they go.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.672" offset="2818675">What I am saying is that that statute, that statute was enough as many cases upheld and as I believe this Court effectively held in the FTC v. National Casualty Case and I am saying that that statute reflects a Rhode Island Policy and reflects a kind of regulation which meets the requirements of Section 2(b) to trigger the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.484" offset="2929852">I had come to the point where I had pointed out that first, the business of insurance was plainly involved, the heart of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.225" offset="2960885">That Rhode Island extensively regulates in a variety of ways and I must say that the unfair practice of statute itself would have been enough regulation without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.354" offset="2997352">I added that this case is a stocker situation because Rhode Island had actually taken steps to focus on the problems of course, and availability of malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.650" offset="3038521">The First Circuit however held that these plaintiffs could maintain a suit because they had alleged a concerted refusal by the three companies to sell malpractice insurance to the dissatisfied policy holders of St. Paul, who when they could not get the occurrence basis policy from St. Paul sought coverage from the other three.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.589" offset="3134338">In so doing, the First Circuit rejected not only the District Court and the views of a dissenting judge there but a number of other decisions and other circuits which expressed this fear about that kind of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.208" offset="3192748">But if you focus on just a consorted refusal to deal without more, then virtually any collaborative conduct among insurance companies could be styled and pleaded as a boycott, if the boycott meant a consorted refusal of deal and was equivalent with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.120" offset="3272474">Now, some other courts had look at South-Eastern Underwriters and Legislative History and it concluded that it was limited that that phrase “boycott, coercion, and intimidation” was limited at the type of conduct directed in involvement of South-Eastern Underwriters directed at insurance companies, at excluding insurance companies from the business at forcing them to behave in the way the conspiracy dictated.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.878" offset="3367455">They limited the provision to insurance agent, acts aimed suppressing or dictating the policies of insurance companies and insurance agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.468" offset="3409773">We do not say that that particular gloss is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.834" offset="3435269">What we do say is that the result which the First Circuit achieved here which was to define a boycott in a way which would virtually swallow up the rest of the 2(b) exemption need not have occurred and that the First Circuit was wrong when it concluded that it was compelled to reach this result by the plain meaning of the phrase “boycott, coercion, and intimidation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="864.092" offset="3536310">Now I start my statutory analysis where I think the government does and probably my opponents and most of the commentators and Judge McAllen in the DC Circuit in the recent proctor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.290" offset="3601094">And that is with South-Easter Underwriters because lo and behold, the phrase “boycott, coercion, and intimidation” appears in the South-Eastern Underwriters’ Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.943" offset="3639755">Now there, what happened was this and it is crucial to focus on the two types of conduct which South-Eastern Underwriters’ dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.880" offset="3671416">To start with, there was a price fixing conspiracy on fire insurance throughout the South-Eastern part of the United States and the Court called that price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.752" offset="3706942">In addition to the price fixing conspiracy, there was a conspiracy among the members of the South-Eastern Underwriters Association to force everyone to do business on their terms and that took two forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.048" offset="3768173">First, there was conduct which was specifically directed at other insurance companies and agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.908" offset="3791579">In the case of insurance companies, one of the principle ways was to refuse to reinsure their risk and this was vital and they withdrew re-insurance from any company which was unwilling to follow the price-fixing conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.415" offset="3845600">In the case of the agent, they had something called the separation and they said to the agent, if you handle the product of a price-cutter, we are going to put you out of business because we are not going to sell you any insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.871" offset="3891471">Another way, they dealt with this was they sold fire insurance and allied lines and they said to the consumer, “If you deal with one of these price-cutters on fire insurance, we are not going to sell you other products.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.255" offset="3944970">We are just going to not deal with you at all”.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.222" offset="3956882">In order to induce those policy holders not to deal with the price-cutters.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.029" offset="3984049">Now, we think that South-Eastern Underwriters itself demonstrates what the court, not only what the court but what Congress must have meant by boycott, coercion, and intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.345" offset="4037339">And I would like to draw a line, if I could on the one hand, you have the question of the policy of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.521" offset="4066074">That is what the Sherman Act and the Anti- Trust laws are all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.216" offset="4084777">To enfoster competition between companies and if under the Sherman Act, that there were no McCarran Act, companies getting together and deciding they would not compete, will not sell insurance to their competitor’s policy holders would be a violation of Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.508" offset="4137963">Section 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act however says, the general question of whether a state should have a policy of competition or non-competition in insurance should be for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.252" offset="4188954">If the state enacts regulation, dealing with that area then the state occupies the field and the Sherman Act is withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.590" offset="4230332">Now, where is it that Congress, what did Congress reserve?</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.214" offset="4248826">In the boycott section, it said one thing was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.963" offset="4267844">That is, it is one thing for people not to compete with one anther and for the state either by an authorizing law or by a little Sherman Act or a little FTC Act to pursue a policy of competition, non-competition, or a policy somewhere in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.954" offset="4335762">It is another thing for the private companies to take it into their own hands to say that those who do want to compete and are permitted to compete should be excluded from the business and that pressure should be applied to those who want to compete not to deal with those people in order to exclude those who wish to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.571" offset="4410263">In short, a boycott, coercion, and intimidation, however you use those phrases whether separately or singly, is a kind of penal enforcement conduct aimed at regulating competition by excluding those who will want to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.436" offset="4481734">And as I see the line, on one side, you have agreements between which the states either can prohibit or can apply the Rule of Reasonableness Test or outlaw per se just as under the Sherman Act or authorize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.881" offset="4543488">And on the other hand, conduct which says we, the private industry will decide who does business and we will decide whether you can compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.980" offset="4583821">And that in our view, that pressure to prevent people who do want to compete from competing is boycott, coercion, and intimidation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.462" offset="6065799">He is regulating because that was the precise issue Your Honor raised in FTC v. National Casualty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.816" offset="6087220">Let me go back to that case because it has great application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.853" offset="6099341">In FTC v. National Casualty, the question whether certain advertising practices of insurance company were regulated by the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.490" offset="6137897">This Court said that because the state had a law which prohibits unfair and deceptive practices that that law asks the federal jurisdiction altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.761" offset="6183037">This Court did not say that the Local Administrator had to conclude like the FTC that it was deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.802" offset="6215115">In fact, one of the premises of the briefs before the Court was that was precisely where the conflict could arise because the State Administrator could decide “I do not think this is deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.941" offset="6255657">In my knowledge of the insurance business, this is not deceptive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.994" offset="6267883">And I say here, the state should be free and I think that was precisely the intent to Section 2(b) to leave under this regulatory law, the power to the state to decide should this agreement alleged in this complaint, should that conduct be deemed anti-competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.011" offset="6339981">In fact, Rhode Island took a different course here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.123" offset="6352415">Rhode Island did not look to hobgoblins of conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.287" offset="6369133">Instead it said, there is a real problem here, we are going to deal with it with a Joint Underwriting Association, a method used by other states in other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.055" offset="6412183">So, we think there is regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.710" offset="6418766">It is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.507" offset="6422005">I am sorry I misspoke myself about the question of policy approvals earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.719" offset="6442799">I think the line that we are tying to draw here between boycotts on the one hand, enforcement activity designed to pressure other people to stop competing and policies of competition on the other side is not only confirmed by South-Eastern Underwriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.200" offset="6516777">It is equally confirmed by other hazes in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.008" offset="6536004">Judge Coffin was persuaded that his result was compelled by the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.112" offset="6560350">The plain meaning first of all of boycott, coercion, intimidation is not all that plain, in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.939" offset="6579680">But we went back and looked at the boycott cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.040" offset="6592115">Not only at South-Eastern Underwriters where the conduct was entirely different than what is alleged here but at Fashion Originators’ Guild, at Eastern Retail Lumber and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.299" offset="6629104">And each of those cases, you find the same common thread. You find conspirators getting together to try to dictate the terms on which someone will compete and to force out of business, those who will not listen to the conspiracy’s terms dictated by the conspirators.</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.269" offset="7125013">I actually did not put that little extra touch on the doctors themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.517" offset="7142044">If the doctors were able to persuade whether through withholding their own custom or simply out of their persuasive power to go with an implied threat that they might not deal with these companies and said to the companies, do not deal with them because we want to put them out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.942" offset="7199723">That would be a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.226" offset="7204843">That would be Klors, that would be United States against General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.325" offset="7249251">Finally, I would like to make one last point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.134" offset="7256461">I would like to return to the point I started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.987" offset="7267850">I am meeting into my rebuttal time but I think I will do that, if the court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.945" offset="7295749">And that is back where I started from to the policy of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.076" offset="7312258">I think this Act does have a relatively clear purpose and that is to have the Federal Power defer in the area of regulation of the insurance business and where the states have regulated to put policies of competition in the hands of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.550" offset="7394178">In this case, I think the decision of the First Circuit nullifies that purpose because as I said earlier the key area of regulation left to the states was the relationship between the insurance company and the policyholder and matters affecting the terms, rates, and availability of coverage to the policyholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.974" offset="7475889">That is exactly what is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.816" offset="7483204">I think that Judge Coffin’s decision although we do not have to show an actual conflict in the state regulatory policy and the Sherman Act in order to trigger the 2(b) exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.294" offset="7525104">I think there is a conflict and there is an area of conflict involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.391" offset="7545479">And that area is this, first questions of conspiracy always questions a fact and different fact finders can view those facts differently depending on what they understand to be the underlying conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.037" offset="7596053">Rhode Island could very well come to a very different factual conclusion from viewing all the facts in any case under its unfair methods of competition law or in deciding whether to use that law or employ a Joint Underwriting Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.081" offset="7652268">So there could be inconsistent conclusions of fact as to what the causes of the medical malpractice problems here were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.160" offset="7676614">There could be different conclusions as to what standard of law should apply whether you should apply the per se rule which applies to agreements not to compete under the Federal Anti-Trust Laws or whether you should apply some Rule of Reason Test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.894" offset="7727501">Perhaps there was some justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.344" offset="7733352">Perhaps some things were so bad that the insurance commissions say well this is not so bad if these guys said, “Look, let us stop selling this policy, it is going to drive us all insolvent and no one will have any malpractice insurance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.464" offset="7781835">I think there are other areas where the decision of the First Circuit threatens, accepted insurance practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.958" offset="7807749">That is not crucial to my position but I think it is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.021" offset="7824049">The respondents have said, that if you have a Joint Insurance, like the JUA and if you take canter to the one side, and the First Circuit’s decision to the other, what you have to conclude is that in every case of refusal of coverage under the JUA, is possible to commence a Federal Anti-Trust suit and claim that that is a consorted refusal by the members of the JUA to deal with that policyholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.958" offset="7927808">It may be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.046" offset="7932092">They say apply a Rule of Reason but that will not save it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.902" offset="7939510">That will not save at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.902" offset="7943586">That will not save the policy of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.802" offset="7951109">Because the question of reasonableness is precisely the question which was left to the State Insurance Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.465" offset="7977754">For all of those reasons, the reasons of policy, for reasons of making this statute meaningful and work, we suggest that the line we propose should be drawn and that the boycott, coercion, intimidation should be limited to what was involved in South-Eastern Underwriters and other boycott cases, namely pressure by competitors to prevent other people from engaging in a policy of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.096" offset="8088304">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.897" offset="8127488">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.172" offset="8144624">At the outset, this case seems to revolve about a very finite and very limited issue that is the construction of Section 3(b) of McCarran-Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.144" offset="8212542">But as it evolved, the position of the petitioners shifted from one point to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.144" offset="8252562">And I say this not in a pejorative way but I think to give the context and the history of the case to the Court and to illustrate the weakness of the various positions that the petitioners have retreated to, it would cast some light on the witness of their present position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.458" offset="8325809">First, the case was brought in the District Court of Rhode Island and the case was dismissed upon petitioner’s motion based on the so-called black listing limitation which petitioner’s described to 3(b) of McCarran-Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.107" offset="8408356">And in the Circuit Court of Appeals, the very same limitation was urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.016" offset="8431971">Now, petitioner’s pointed to one thing in the congressional record, in the Legislative History to support their argument for blacklisting and that was a statement of Congressman seller which merely cited blacklisting as an example, when he said for example, will 3(b) prevent blacklisting?</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.782" offset="8511070">But at least at that point, petitioners were pointing to something in the Legislative History which could support their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.626" offset="8542417">At the present stage, since Proctor and by the way there have been a number of cases which have taken the same position as Proctor, I think their case is now in the First, Second, Third, Fourth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.476" offset="8597901">Part of the Fifth Circuit in the Battle Case and the DC Circuit which is Proctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.030" offset="8624023">They now take the position that well, we do not ask that the limitation of 3(b) be narrowed to blacklisting but we say it should be narrowed to include all traders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.654" offset="8678567">In implicit in their argument, May it please the court, is that it must exclude consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.008" offset="8703958">Now, petitioners in the replied brief on page three, state in the second paragraph, “the only issue here now is to draw the line between boycotts and other combinations and conspiracies in restrain of trade covered by the Sherman Act, so as to give meaning to the expressed exemption of 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.294" offset="8817120">Petitioners are now asking this Court to go outside 3(b), outside McCarran-Ferguson and give a definition of a boycott under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.360" offset="8865395">The Sherman Act itself which will fit into their description and thereby exclude petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.321" offset="8905205">And they set forth this proposed definition in the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.091" offset="8924327">The first prong of their definition, I think --</text>

            <text syncTime="2305.400" offset="9301535">So, that the deduction there is that leads us to the conclusion, they now agree that boycott under the Sherman Act is the same as boycott under 3(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.153" offset="9332568">If they come to that position, then they must take the position that Congress in enacting 3(b) meant to do something which was not just an illusion and did not mean to give with one hand and take away by the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="2352.608" offset="9490348">But it is limited not because of 3(b) but because of its meaning under Sherman should be limited.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard Decof</label>
            <text syncTime="2360.433" offset="9521695">Our position of the Court please is that if you apply, --first of all, our first position is that even under the definition that petitioners propose, the respondents here have standing and fall within that definition within the second form of their definition. Our second position is that the definition is unduly restrictive and unduly limiting because by its very nature, it excludes all consumers as victims of boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.334" offset="9657323">It injects into the definition of boycott intent which this court has said on many, many occasions is not a consideration in the definition of boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.146" offset="9692536">The court has said that the effect is a consideration but that the intent is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.421" offset="9717613">They have said this in Silver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.609" offset="9722420">They have said it in Frankfort Distilleries and many other cases if the court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.990" offset="9739870">So, we take the position first that the simple answer to their proposed definition is we do not fall within or outside the limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.975" offset="9787830">The first prong of their definition is that there must be a competitor of the victim as one of the conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.898" offset="9823566">As I stated it was couched in the alternative</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.948" offset="9831716">In the second prong they state that the boycott must be an act which is directed to control the competitive activities of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.080" offset="9872258">Now, the act we fit within the second definition, if the court please, because the act of boycott in this case controlled the commercial activities of the victims that is the doctors and I think since the petitioners have raised the question of the Joint Underwriting Authority, I must put that into context as background to get into this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.252" offset="9980928">This was not a raise if the court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.515" offset="9990018">There was a medical malpractice crisis in the State of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.188" offset="10004647">But the crisis was ignited by this situation where almost half the doctors, more than half the doctors in the State of Rhode Island were insured by St. Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.836" offset="10055324">Most of their policies were going to expire on June 30, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.488" offset="10073924">In April, St. Paul announced that their policies would not be renewed except on a claims-made basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.254" offset="10100986">And I must touch on the nature of the claims-made policy to illustrate what this meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.068" offset="10124183">The claims-made policy would ensure the doctor only in the year in which the policy was in effect and if the doctor had been insured by the same company in the year in which the occurrence took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.750" offset="10178936">Now the doctor’s position was that these locked them in for life with the company because once the first claims-made policy was issued, the doctors must stay with that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.808" offset="10227210">If they decided for example, to change jurisdictions and move to a state in which for example St. Paul did not sell Medical Malpractice Insurance, they would have to have double coverage for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.931" offset="10279664">Since the claims-made policy insured them only for one year over the time, if they should retire, or if they should die, or if they should leave the company, they would have to buy coverage for any actions which might be brought against them in later years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.754" offset="10346955">Whether because, the statute had not expired, whether because there was a discoverability type action for whatever reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.666" offset="10378616">And this coverage could be afforded to them by means of a so-called three reporting endorsements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.509" offset="10405992">They had to be bought in three installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.842" offset="10415292">And so, if a doctor wanted to leave the jurisdiction of Rhode Island, once he had assigned up with St. Paul on a claims-made basis, he would have to buy three reporting endorsements which would cover him for any actions that were brought after the year in which he left because he had been insured in the base year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.587" offset="10494286">Now, if he went to another state, he would have to have double coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.327" offset="10509228">And the cost of these reporting endorsements would have come to about a 150%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.044" offset="10528141">And so the pernicious features of this plan and it was an ingenious plan, was that the doctor was locked in, he could not leave the state, he could not retire from the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.196" offset="10568683">If he died, his wife or his heirs would have 30 days to decide whether or not they would buy the reporting endorsements which would cover actions which were brought afterward.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.859" offset="10655409">If the court please, I will respond to that although we are not in that situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.341" offset="10677352">I think in that situation, this Court or the Federal Court would have the right to look at factual situation to see if it did in fact constitute a boycott, in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.755" offset="10730955">Now, the defendant’s position is that this Court should be frozen to the definition of boycott which had been established in previous cases because of the fact situations in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.561" offset="10782155">In many instances, the court has looked to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.330" offset="10797306">In the first instance, the Court applied the Rule of Reason, though it decided originally in Northern Pacific Railway Case that if the activity was pernicious and had no redeeming virtues, it was a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.610" offset="10850387">Now, we cannot say, now, I do not think the court would be willing to say now, no but everything outside those circumscribed fact situations is not a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.081" offset="10888317">And the situation, Your Honor proposes, it would be a fact situation on which the Court could decide whether or not this was a boycott and if it was a boycott, then it came within the protection of 3(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.116" offset="10940457">But we are not at that question at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.080" offset="10952265">My definition of a boycott if the Court cares to hear, I do not think the Court has to go this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.857" offset="10975357">We are saying that what happened here was a classic boycott. It was a denial of 75 percent of the insurance market to the doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.918" offset="11011615">And we are saying that we fit within the second category of the petitioner’s definition because we are traders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.801" offset="11047141">In our society, the doctors cannot practice their profession without Medical Malpractice Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.266" offset="11068980">This is the same to them as buying a scalpel or stethoscope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.932" offset="11083713">And this is what propelled Rhode Island into the medical malpractice crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.810" offset="11103148">The JUA was formed as a result of this set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.263" offset="11124986">It was not something that was boiling in the pot while this action was taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.054" offset="11152154">The JUA resulted from this set of facts and the JUA is a creature of emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.881" offset="11175455">It was promulgated by the Director of Business Regulation of the State of Rhode Island, because the situation was that the doctors had asked the State to put in freezing legislation so that the matter could be looked into and the insurance companies have threatened to pull out of the State of Rhode Island if the freezing legislation was put in and so the JUA which is really inimical to the idea of free enterprise because the way the JUA was set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.933" offset="11291648">All companies in the State of Rhode Island had to belong to a risk pool and this was a condition of their doing business in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.337" offset="11321323">The fact of the matter was the companies both surfacely complained about the JUA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.336" offset="11345251">They rebelled against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.300" offset="11353192">And it is an emergency type of legislation, a police state type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.988" offset="11375866">The State of Rhode Island certainly does not want to be in the insurance business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.265" offset="11389032">And this is not the kind of thing that should happen. Or if the balance were restored, there would not be any for JUA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.309" offset="11413169">But again, the simple answer to the question of the JUA is it is immaterial here because when this action was brought, there was no JUA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2854.306" offset="11497179">There are a number of states in the country if the Court pleases to my knowledge in which the St. Paul does not do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.787" offset="11519122">There are only four companies in the State of Rhode Island which sell Medical Malpractice Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.852" offset="11543364">Throughout the United States, again there is something that never has been gotten into, I think because of McCarran-Ferguson, there seems to be a territorial allocation in which certain companies deal in certain states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.404" offset="11597594">In my opinion and I am very familiar with the malpractice seen in the State of Rhode Island, I was on the Governor’s Commission which ended up enacting the new legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.153" offset="11652555">The claims experienced in State of Rhode Island to my knowledge has been an excellent one and I wonder why have there not been other companies beside these four petitioners but my answer to you on this question Sir, is that there are a number of jurisdictions in the United States where St. Paul does not sell Medical Malpractice Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.129" offset="11728415">By the same token, companies like Argonaut which deal heavily in Malpractice Insurance are not in the State of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.206" offset="11768748">Now, we say if the Court please that the definition of boycott even if you limit it is a conceited refusal to deal which has that as its effect a restrain on commerce or restrain on trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.282" offset="11849101">Purpose has been counted immaterial as I stated before in many cases by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.530" offset="11870103">And the effect of this boycott, the only boycott before this Court is where the companies refused absolutely to sell insurance of any kind to the doctors who were insured by St. Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.178" offset="11924647">A classic boycott and the only way that this could be remove from that definition is to say a consumer cannot be the victim of a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.701" offset="11962786">This leads us to the anomalous conclusion that a consumer who is protected under the Sherman Act, this is square one law and the petitioners concede this, maybe protected against an act which harms him by virtue of an indirect boycott but cannot be protected from the identical harm when it is aimed directly at him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.542" offset="12082113">Chief Justice, using the appellation case stated that the Sherman Act deals in substance and we are here dealing with substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.536" offset="12110116">And this is why I am urging to this Court that we have a very great issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.509" offset="12133940">Petitioners are asking that the Court examine boycott, the definition of boycott, and pronounce a definition which will exclude consumers from its protection either because they are not competitors of the boycotter or because they are not engaged in some competing business with the boycotter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.897" offset="12251491">Yes, Your Honor but the legislators in adapting the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we submit intended boycott to have the same meaning that it had in the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.462" offset="12309796">We answer the emasculation argument this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.412" offset="12329545">First of all to petitioner’s contention that almost anything could be defined in terms of a boycott, the Court many times has distinguished between the Act or Agreement for example, price fixing and the consorted activity to carry it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.390" offset="12409479">There are many proscribe actions on the Sherman which are not boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.091" offset="12432258">For example, a conspiracy to crash a competitor, this could be carried out without a boycott in any number of ways by stealing trade secrets, by stealing employees, by false advertising, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.571" offset="12490250">Tying agreements need not be enforced by a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.923" offset="12507595">The entire Section 2 on monopolies that is not boycott, so, even if you gave the fullest range to the meaning of boycott under McCarran-Ferguson and therefore insured the protection that Sherman guaranteed to the public, there is still a vast area of installation for the insurance companies reserved by McCarran-Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.498" offset="12601950">Beside this, McCarran-Ferguson insulated the insurance companies against any actions brought under the other Anti-Trust act, the Clayton Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.103" offset="12656389">This again is a vast area of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.146" offset="12668510">Finally, the insurance companies were insulated by McCarran-Ferguson against any action brought by any other federal under any other Federal legislation that did not relate directly to insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.212" offset="12720755">And so, with reference to the emasculation argument, I believe it is an artificial argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.187" offset="12744683">There is a great area of protection still reserved to the insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.526" offset="12818035">With reference to the definition of boycott, if we put that aside, there have been allegations of coercion and intimidation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.772" offset="12847083">And the legislators made a claim that boycott, coercion, and intimidation were not the same things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.523" offset="12874041">As a matter of fact Senator O’Mahoney said, “We are talking about six things here that the state does not have power to regulate, boycott, coercion, intimidation, or the agreement to do any of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.437" offset="12933705">So, that again is an issue that transcends the issue of the boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.683" offset="13006639">Now, petitioners have relied greatly and spent a great deal of their time in their briefs and in their arguments on the question of whether or not this is state regulation and whether or not we have an area of state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.661" offset="13074557">We do not deny this and never have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.578" offset="13090230">Respondents’ position is not that State of Rhode Island is not engaged in the regulation of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.517" offset="13118025">However, the fact that they are engaged and the regulation of insurance do not permit them to authorize acts of boycott, coercion, and intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.928" offset="13163687">This has been specifically carved out of that protection and this Court has not been reluctant to look at McCarran-Ferguson cases and for example in the SCC versus Variable Annuities, the Court determined what the scope of insurance was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.750" offset="13246965">There was no question there was regulation of insurance but in that case, the Court determined a variable annuity policy was not within the scope of the business of insurance in FTC versus Travelers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.872" offset="13291478">The Court determined the scope of state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.614" offset="13306420">And again, in that situation the question was whether or not the Travelers are selling these policies outside of state by mail although it had an act which purported to regulate these things, what was the extent and what was the limit of that regulation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.725" offset="13378831">In a most important case, the Frankfort Distillery Case was not a McCarran Case but it was a Miller-Tydings Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.366" offset="13433375">In the Frankfort Distillery Case, the State of Colorado had a Fair Trade Practices Act which allowed the fixing of prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.545" offset="13466080">And the Miller-Tydings Act gave them the right to do this so they were regulating in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.280" offset="13489068">There was a boycott involved in enforcing, fixing of prices and the state said that even though they are permitted by the provisions of Miller-Tydings to fix prices and even though they are permitted by the 21st Amendment to do this that still in all that did not permit them to engage in activities of boycott, coercion, or intimidation which would be beyond the scrutiny of the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.067" offset="13604216">Again, the third case, I wanted to cite with reference to McCarran-Ferguson was SEC v. National Securities in which the Court determined what was an insurance policy and this was a case in which there was a prosecution by the SEC against the defendant company for misstatements and misrepresentations made to stockholders of a company which it was going to merge with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.595" offset="13742351">And there was a law that the Director of Insurance in the state had to approve any merges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.315" offset="13793238">Now, the SEC first brought an action for injunction and this was denied because the insurance -- it was held to be insurance and regulated by the state and the merger went through and the SEC then brought an action to unwind the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.306" offset="13861156">And this Court said even though it was the Insurance Director’s obligation to approve the merger and even though he did approve the merger, he did not say to these people, you must merge, all he said was you can and I find it to be adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.777" offset="13943076">But the Court held also that this could be reviewed and that McCarran-Ferguson did not insulate the state from the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.946" offset="14003680">Now, this case is not even a strong on its fact as the Barry Case because in the SEC v. National Securities case, the state had passed legislation authorizing and directing the Director of Insurance to approve such a merger and he had acted and had done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.566" offset="14078181">In the Barry case, there has never been any action by the State of Rhode Island to authorize the Act here and as a matter of fact, I believe that petitioner’s will concede this, there could not be if the State of Rhode Island did say we authorize boycott, coercion, or intimidation to enforce this price fixing, this will be a nullity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3833.011" offset="15411994">The government’s position in this case is that a boycott under Section 3(b) of McCarran-Ferguson means a consorted refusal to deal when people get together and refuse to deal with someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.661" offset="15478554">A situation which means that the victim of the boycott finds himself excluded from the section of the market which is represented by the people who are combining in this endeavor to exclude him.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard Decof</label>
            <text syncTime="4769.255" offset="19157013">Just a brief marker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.633" offset="19170492">Your Honor, we have come along way from what Judge Coffin said was the plain meaning of boycott because one of the questions that Justice Stevens asked was whether a market allocation is a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.664" offset="19222632">Under the Solicitor General’s definition, a market allocation which this Court in Topco and Sealy(ph) and in other cases treated as a market allocation and a Per Se Violation, antitrust which becomes a boycott so much for the plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.985" offset="19275922">I also would like to add that we now have a situation where conduct which is economically indistinguishable is treated as a boycott and while I suggested that we have come to an artificial reading, in fact, I believe the government’s position and the respondent’s position is most artificial because the examples we have had of where you have four people, four companies, I think my correspondents here would like to get out because apparently, they are not part of the boycott, you have for companies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.697" offset="19394727">One of them is going to sell claims-made and three do not want to sell, occurrence is that they do not want to sell anything so they have to try claims-made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.750" offset="19426910">Now, if all four had agreed to sell only claims-made, according to the Solicitor General, that is not a boycott but the other is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.728" offset="19462854">I say that there is no logical distinction. I would like to just go back to our position as to why there is a sound and logical dividing line between what we say is a boycott and what we say is covered by 3 (b) exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.208" offset="19524817">Under our definition, a boycott is exactly what this Court has used it in the past situations where although the competitors or group of conspirators agree among themselves that they will not sell except at a fixed price or fixed terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.549" offset="19586152">They do more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.995" offset="19591899">They prevent the fellow who does want to sell at a different price from coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.028" offset="19612066">They decide in Senator O’Mahoney’s words, engaged in private regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.032" offset="19632023">They are going to punish that fellow in a variety of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.517" offset="19646025">In the South-Eastern-Underwriters Case, as Mr. Friedman correctly points out they punished that fellow by cutting off the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.868" offset="19671416">But it was not just the consorted refusal deal with the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.697" offset="19682701">It was a consorted refusal to deal with consumer who had to marry the deal with the price-cutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.973" offset="19707883">That is what South-Eastern Underwriters called a boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.121" offset="19724392">That is what this Legislative History is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.715" offset="19734841">That is where Congress drew the line.</text>

            <text syncTime="4937.725" offset="19830867">And that was this, my definition of a boycott in most cases would be very much like the Fifth and Ninth Circuit definitions which limited to insurance agents and insurance companies because in most cases, as in South-Eastern Underwriters, my description and this Court’s definition in the use of a boycott in past cases, in the insurance business, typically the fellow who is going to be boycotted or pressured not to compete is a competing agent or a competing insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.626" offset="19930446">I realize that reading Proctor, that that is not always the case that you can reach out into another business which is what happened in Proctor and do the same thing they did in South-Eastern Underwriters.</text>
