            <text syncTime="83.897" offset="415518">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.426" offset="429624">The United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina declared the limitation of liability provisions within the Price-Anderson Act to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.107" offset="480406">Duke appeals to this Court on two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.534" offset="498065">The first is, is the cause justiciable under Article 3 of the constitution and two, whether the limitation of liability provisions is unconstitutional under the due process clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="120.655" offset="562535">The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 was passed by Congress to encourage the wide bread application of a peaceful use of atomic energy in medicine, agriculture and industry, but particularly in the generation of electric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.891" offset="631498">By 1957, Congress had determined that economics was the foremost obstacle to the development of nuclear power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.657" offset="678623">I say this because of the “but for” argument which is so central both in the plaintiff’s brief and in the opinion of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.844" offset="723345">If there is a “but for” argument or cause in this matter, it is with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and not with the amendments that consist of the Price-Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.984" offset="791890">But Congress determined that there was a further problem to the development of the nuclear power plant and that was the potentially great liability exposure for a large accident, although the probabilities of such an accident occurring were exceedingly small.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.117" offset="856465">So small in fact that they were not being creditable although the possibility did exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.633" offset="882483">The Price-Anderson amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 was the Congressional solution to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.362" offset="921353">The Price-Anderson has two objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.119" offset="932429">The first is to protect the public against uncompensated loss resulting from the peaceful uses of atomic energy and second is to protect the industry against the risk of unlimited liability in the unlikely and remote event that a catastrophic accident might occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.674" offset="1018633">Limitation of liability provisions is not peculiar to the United States with respect to the nuclear power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.947" offset="1043710">Nineteen nations have similar legislation as shown in our exhibit 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.759" offset="1070982">The objective of protecting the public in Price-Anderson was accomplished in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.045" offset="1092089">First through mandatory insurance and second through governmental indemnity.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.835" offset="1679322">What it did in effect was to create a federal fund, if I might, out of which claimants from a possible accident might proceed against rather than the individual industries involved if the accident were unlimited liability.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="418.555" stopTime="420.782">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <text syncTime="420.782" offset="1763123">Yes, sir, I think it does, absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.406" offset="1781617">In 1966, Congress created absolute liability for any substantial nuclear accident by requiring mandatory waivers of defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.429" offset="1825712">Further amendments were made in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.736" offset="1838878">The statute of limitations waiver was extended further and a second self-insurance pool of liability insurance was established and this will phase out the governmental indemnity and will allow the limitation of liability currently $560 million to move upward.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.270" offset="1913065">By 1985, that limit could be $1 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.751" offset="1938979">The Congress also expressly stated in the Act in 1975 with respect to the possibility that an accident might exceed $500 million, that it will “take whatever action is deemed necessary and appropriate to protect the public from the consequences of a disaster of such magnitude.”</text>
            <text syncTime="486.984" offset="2027900">There are now 62 operating nuclear power reactors in the United States producing approximately 10% of the nation’s electricity and there are approximately 150 either planned or under construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.718" offset="2086832">No accident had a licensed nuclear power reactor involving radiation, injury, disease or death to a member of the public has ever occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.015" offset="2128001">A nuclear explosion at a power reactor is not possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.802" offset="2147123">The only way that a catastrophic accident could occur would be a core melt which breaches the containment building and releases a large amount of radioactive material.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.621" offset="2198427">Just like a coal-fired plant, a nuclear power reactor produces heat to turn water into steam to drive the turbines to produce electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.075" offset="2240223">A nuclear power reactor obtains this heat from its uranium fuel in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.036" offset="2264047">Approximately a 93% of the heat is obtained by way of the nuclear chain reaction and the balance about 7% comes from the decay of nuclear materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.145" offset="2320576">The nuclear chain reaction maybe stopped in a fraction of a second so that it produces no further heat, but the decay heat cannot be so quickly terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.554" offset="2370208">A core melt would take place if the fuel were deprived of its normal and emergency cooling waters so as to allow the heat to build up.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.721" offset="2414825">This could cause the fuel to melt.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.701" offset="2426737">The heat, thereby, created could be sufficient to melt through the bottom of the building or possibly lead to a breach of the containment building.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.425" offset="2465608">Because a breach of the containment building poses the threat of a large scale accident taking place in terms of damages to the outside public, the greatest care is taken in the design, construction and operation of the reactor in order to reduce to the absolute minimum, the attendant risk to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.878" offset="2551498">Congress passed Price-Anderson on the findings that the risk of a very large accident occurring was exceedingly small.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.763" offset="2582950">This finding has been substantiated by further and extensive studies and the operating experience of the nuclear power reactors.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.382" offset="2617431">In 1965, the joint committee of the Congress reported that the likelihood of a major reactor accident was exceedingly low and that no reactor would be licensed in this country if there was “a reasonable likelihood that its operation might result in an accident of the severity contemplated by the Price-Anderson legislation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="661.795" offset="2727145">The reactor safety study, under the direction of Professor Rasmussen of MIT and a professional staff of 60 persons was published in October 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.561" offset="2770195">The study confirmed previous findings by Congress of the very low risk of a catastrophic accident occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.289" offset="2797154">Plaintiffs and other critics differ with this study in terms of the extent to which the study estimates of an accident of such magnitude occurring might be an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.981" offset="2851906">Plaintiff’s own witness put the error at like a factor of 10 because he said, “for an error much in excess of 10, one would find a contradiction with the present operating experience.”</text>
            <text syncTime="710.644" offset="2922541">Now, that was more than a year-and-a half ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.509" offset="2938006">While the court below said “it is not a bookie,” the unblemished operating experience of 300 reactor years in this country and 1,000 years worldwide receive scant attention from the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.746" offset="3014910">As one witness put it, “if there were any high probability of an accident scenario, we would at least have seen some damage to the public or the environment in all of the years a reactor operating experience.”</text>
            <text syncTime="752.899" offset="3091501">Addressing the questions in this case, first, as to the justiciability issue, we have discussed the case or controversy issues in our main brief, at pages 27-52 in our Appendix A.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.192" offset="3160674">We stand on our arguments there and would not further argue them except to say, in our view, the mere possibility of an injury from a postulated accident is not enough to give standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.647" offset="3222532">Turning now to the arguments on the merits; Congress has legislated in a field in which it has undoubted power.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.914" offset="3255655">It relied primarily upon the commerce power, but there are others, the national defense, the general welfare and the bankruptcy powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.326" offset="3297242">In the field of economic regulation once Congress has acted within its power, the presumption of constitutionality attaches and in a case like this, the burden is on the complaining party to demonstrate that Congress has acted in an arbitrary or irrational way.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.800" offset="3387103">Plaintiffs have failed to carry this burden and by implication, we suggest, admit that they cannot meet the rationality standard when they suggest a higher standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.473" offset="3449797">They first suggest that the issue here is similar to that decided in the sterilization case of Skinner v. Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.238" offset="3492951">They then retreat from that position advocating an intermediate level of review, but that position is not held for very long, for in the very next breath, they revive the test of Skinner when they say that Price-Anderson is the “but for cause” of a nuclear catastrophe that is certain to occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.441" offset="3693676">The implication of this argument is crystal clear and that is, that the decision by Congress to encourage the peaceful applications of atomic energy in the private promotion of nuclear power plants to provide a diverse energy source for this country was a reprehensible decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.940" offset="3807674">Therefore, they argue, this court should agree with them and substitute its judgment on this question of national policy for that of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.044" offset="3864099">The decisions of this Court are clearly to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.195" offset="3884683">This Court has repeatedly said that it is only concerned with the power of Congress and not with its wisdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.344" offset="3929301">Only if the statute manifests a patently arbitrary classification, oddly lacking in rational justification, is it unconstitutional to test provided in Fleming v.

            <text syncTime="1050.062" offset="4280177">Yes, sir and we submit that the Act does meet that fine-tuning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.319" offset="4313196">The answer to the problems perceived by Congress to the development of the nuclear power industry was Price-Anderson and that was to require industry to guard against accidents of a conceivable, though not expected magnitude, by available insurance, to assure the public of protection above that amount up to a point, but refuse to commit in advance public moneys to pay the cost of an almost inconceivable catastrophe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.936" offset="4459691">That result is eminently rational and reasonable, but this Court has never applied either strict scrutiny or an intermediate standard of review to a statute which limits liability or otherwise modifies common law remedies for future torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.356" offset="4537327">It has, instead considered, whether the statute served a legitimate legislative purpose for dealing with a perceived problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.085" offset="4580272">This, we contend, is the rationality test, but if more than rationality is required such as the suggestions of this Court has required in the removal of common law remedies that a quid pro quo must be provided in its place, we do not subscribe to that view, but if that is assumed for argument’s sake, we suggest that the Act provides substantial quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.561" offset="4694166">It assures a fund to pay claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.845" offset="4711302">It imposes absolute liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.201" offset="4724781">It weighs short statutes of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.230" offset="4752889">It provides for fair treatment of latent injuries and it eliminates completely the rush to the courthouse door which would exist without the substitution of Price-Anderson for the common law state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.306" offset="4821225">It eliminates the rush to the courthouse door to establish a claim and to perfect the judgment lien and funds are available to pay claims without regard to who is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.969" offset="4879844">Turning now to plaintiff’s argument that the remedy provided by Price-Anderson is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.228" offset="4908892">This argument is based upon two fallacious assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.382" offset="4929477">The first assumption is that the catastrophic accident they describe is certain to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.823" offset="4963227">The second assumption is that following such a catastrophic accident, Congress will do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.532" offset="5002097">The first assumption is contrary to the conclusion Congress reached in light of all the information which was before the district court and much more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.113" offset="5048386">The second assumption is contrary to the pledge of Congress stated in the law, and also contrary to the history of Congressional appropriations with respect to national disasters, which it is interesting to note, plaintiffs acknowledge the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.615" offset="5122365">Plaintiffs also attempt to explain away the analogy of the limitation of liability in connection with ships and airlines by suggesting that in the case of ships, the injured bystander could have insured against the loss and with respect to airlines, the injured person may receive up to the limit of $75,000 per claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.713" offset="5230825">But in the case of Price-Anderson, the insurance is provided not by the innocent bystander, but by the industry and even with a limitation of liability of $560 million, an accident with 5,000 claims would yield up to $112,000 per claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.779" offset="6255034">My brother has discussed the grounds set forth in the decision of the district court for finding that this provision of Price-Anderson was unconstitutional, specifically the due process ground and the equal protection ground that is implied in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.417" offset="6357643">I would like to address myself to the issue that was not relied upon by the district court, but that appellees urge in their response at pages 22-26 in their brief that this limitation of liability constitutes a taking of private property for public use without just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.021" offset="6476030">First, we submit that there is no protectable property here within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.093" offset="6512288">There is perhaps an expectation of recovery in the event of an actionable wrong that has not yet occurred and may not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.330" offset="6561294">We submit that there is no vested right of recovery in something as supposititious as that and that this is not protectable property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.089" offset="6636318">Further, we submit that that there is no taking here by the enactment of the Price-Anderson legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.216" offset="6672785">This is a regulatory measure and it does not even regulate property owned by appellees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.793" offset="6879152">For example, the government initially had a monopoly if all fissionable material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.928" offset="6911648">Indeed, the statute provided that possession of facilities for the use of fissionable material and possession or transportation of fissionable fuel was a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.131" offset="6988448">I suppose if the government had kept its monopoly and had built these plants itself, it would not have had to provide for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.788" offset="7043097">I suppose, then the compensation would be obtained by anyone injured through the Federal Tort Claims Act and whether the Federal Tort Claims Act is mandated by the constitution, I am not quite sure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.842" offset="7371299">If the federal government had retained its monopoly of atomic power, that certainly could have resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.882" offset="7403482">But here, there is a regulation of property not owned by appellees in which appellees have no interest and so again, we say this is not a taking in addition to they are not being protectable property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.180" offset="7460638">Finally, although appellees do not make this argument fully, it might be urged that if their property was taken or they were deprived of substantial enjoinment of it by the action of a regulated utility that that might constitute a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.572" offset="7558231">This Court has suggested that the taking of private property by a state-regulated facility is not a taking by the state, and therefore, we think this argument that the district court did not make in support of its judgment, but that appellees make in their brief also must fail as their argument related to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.351" offset="7673379">My brother spoke about the matter of whether there was an adequate quid pro quo and he was asked to suppose that a quid pro quo is required by due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.846" offset="10987377">The fundamental flaw in appellees’ argument is that they view the Price-Anderson Act as simply another regulatory statute and argue that it is analogous to government regulation of such activities as mining or that it is analogous to government-imposed rent control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.236" offset="11064909">However, a careful examination of the Act shows that it is not simply another regulatory statute and that it has four features which distinguish it from other limitations on liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2771.607" offset="11166368">With your permission, I will discuss the statute and then address standing before I reach the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.592" offset="11190297">In fact, and this is the point that I would like to stress in my discussion of the statute, the Price-Anderson Act is a unique action by Congress which severely and arbitrarily limits recovery available to victims of a nuclear accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.318" offset="11257170">Rather than involving a regulation of a business such as Duke Power Company, the Price-Anderson Act creates a situation which could deprive persons of their homes and cause them serious health injuries while simultaneously precluding them from resorting to their state law remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.535" offset="11342120">The thrust of the Act is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.035" offset="11352047">First, it creates a pot of money, $560 million, to cover damages arising out of a nuclear accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.736" offset="11386842">Second, it limits all liability of all possibly responsible parties to that pot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.973" offset="11423831">To explain how the statute would operate and this is important to the ultimate fairness and adequacy of the remedy, I would like to use an example of a hypothetical victim and look at the statute and ask two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.852" offset="11495407">How much would that victim receive in the event of an accident and what are the chances that that hypothetical victim would be compensated?</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.593" offset="11534277">For the purposes of the example, I will assume that the victim sustains $1,000 in property damage or personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.311" offset="11569177">First, let us look at how much money the victim would recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.040" offset="11588089">If the accident causes $560 million in damage or less, then the victim would recover $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.920" offset="11619645">This is an example of an accident where the limitation on liability would not come into play and if all accidents were under $560 million, the limitation on liability would not be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.393" offset="11673562">In fact, this case would not be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.571" offset="11690280">However, for a major accident, when exceeding $560 million, the victim share becomes proportionately smaller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.273" offset="11725075">So that in the event of an accident causing $1 billion in damage, his share is half or $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.200" offset="11756736">If the accident causes $60 billion in damage, then his share would be $10 or less than a 1% recovery for the damages incurred.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Schultz</label>
            <text syncTime="3135.690" offset="12622747">On our taking argument, assuming that the government were building and operating nuclear power plants or looking at this case, we are not arguing that simply because the government is a factor in damage that it is a taking every time, but in a situation where the government passes the limitation on liability in the Price-Anderson Act which was a precondition to nuclear power, then there the government involvement is much more substantial and Mr. Chief Justice, I would submit it is not dissimilar from two cases which we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.344" offset="12781363">The first of those is Richards v. Washington Terminal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.231" offset="12796827">There the government passed a statute authorizing a railroad company to build a railroad through the City of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.511" offset="12834025">The statute also had the effect of nullifying the State or the District of Columbia Nuisance Laws of protecting the railroad from those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.612" offset="12890345">In that case, the railroad built the railroad, it built a tunnel, Mr. Richards was a nearby property owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.252" offset="12920961">He was unhappy because the soot and smoke from the railroad tunnel came onto his property and depreciated its value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.796" offset="12963175">The Court held that there was a taking there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.336" offset="12977281">In other words, even though Congress did not actually build a railroad just as Congress has not built nuclear power plants, what it did in authorizing the railroad and most important in immunizing the railroad company from nuisance actions is precisely analogous, I submit, to what has happened here where the government has immunized Duke Power Company from nuisance actions or from any actions by persons injured from a nuclear accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.846" offset="13091384">I would submit that Griggs v. Allegheny County is also similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.746" offset="13110923">There, the Court held there to be a taking when a private airplane caused damage from noise to private property and the Court held there to be a taking because the airport was owned by the county and the county’s involvement in building the airport and marketing the routes for the airline was sufficient government involvement for there to be a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.048" offset="13216145">If I may, I would like to return to my example of the hypothetical victim and I want to look at what the recovery would be to a victim in the event of an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.557" offset="13286153">I had just described the extremely minimal recovery in a case of a $60-billion accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.578" offset="13314261">While $60 billion may sound like an incredibly high figure, but it is not unrealistic in light of the most recent government study on this subject, that study which had been referred to previously, the reactor safety study.</text>

            <text syncTime="5135.117" offset="20620396">This is very clear from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.668" offset="20630636">For example, the Vice President of General Electric which was one of the two major manufacturers of nuclear reactors came to Congress in 1957 and testified that even though his company was in the middle of constructing the first reactor, that unless Congress acted to limit the liability, his company would simply walk away from its project and not make the investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.858" offset="20731364">But Mr. Chief Justice, the second part of the answer is that the victim could sue the manufacturer of the reactor which, here, is Westinghouse which is a company that would have suffered no loss and would have billions of dollars in assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.048" offset="20792177">The Price-Anderson Act takes away not only the victim’s right to sue Duke, but also the right to sue the manufacturer or any other responsible party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.139" offset="20836481">Moreover, I think it is important to point out that under the Price-Anderson Act it may be as much as 20 years before these victims would receive any recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.380" offset="20881516">This is because the Act requires that before any compensation beyond a small amount of emergency funds may be paid out, a district court judge must come up with a plan of distribution to provide for the late claimants, these are the health injuries that would not appear for 10-20 years after the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.254" offset="20976915">If you do not know what those injuries are going to be, it may be simply impossible to pay the early claimants until you know what the injuries of all the claimants are.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.764" offset="21038982">I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that the point you made earlier in the argument is critical and that is if Congress had the power to promote nuclear power by limiting the liability to $560 million, then that argument would lead to the proposition that it would have had the power to limit the liability to $0.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.116" offset="21132396">In fact, it would lead to the proposition that the federal Congress could eliminate all state law remedies for torts.</text>

            <text syncTime="5271.286" offset="21165101">Mr. Schultz, on that very question, the corporate device itself is a method of limiting liability that promotes capital investment and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.730" offset="21194881">Supposing we held the statute unconstitutional and Congress passed a new statute and said that the power company convey the plant assets into a separate corporation whose liability shall be limited to its own assets and there shall be no piercing of corporate veil or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.853" offset="21251410">Would that be unconstitutional?</text>

            <text syncTime="5485.639" offset="22022545">It simply boils down as the plaintiffs suggest in their argument that there were alternatives available to Congress, which Congress considered such as writing a blank check on the treasury of the United States, but Congress decided that that was not in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.833" offset="22091299">They did have the power to limit the amount available for a creditable accident, one that they thought might have a chance of occurring, but for the uncreditable accident, Congress did not feel that it had to go that far to cover that eventuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.861" offset="22179384">There is where Congress promised to act in the event, although extremely unlikely, that it would then consider the matter in an after-the-facts situation.</text>
