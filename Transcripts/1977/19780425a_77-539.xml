            <text syncTime="18.759" offset="155016">Mr. Ikenson, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fredrick L. Ikenson</label>
            <text syncTime="22.142" offset="168495">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.867" offset="183437">This case presents the question whether the forgiveness of a commodity tax on the exportation of certain consumer electronic products from Japan is a bounty or grant under our countervailing duty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.875" offset="239443">The petitioner is a domestic producer of such consumer electronic products as television sets, radios and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.356" offset="269328">In 1970, the petitioner filed a complaint with the Treasury Department, claiming that Japan conferred a bounty or grant upon the exportation of like products by reason of the remission of a commodity tax on exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.110" offset="340381">In January of 1976, the Secretary of the Treasury made a determination that no bounty or grant was paid or bestowed on exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.757" offset="383012">Under a then recently enacted statute, the petitioner sought and obtained judicial review over the secretary?s negative determination in the United States Customs Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.863" offset="435362">From the pleadings filed by the parties in the Court, it became clear that the essential facts were not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.275" offset="465037">Japan imposes a commodity tax on certain products when shipped from the manufacturer?s factory for domestic consumption, that is consumption in Japan, however, the same products when shipped for export from Japan are exempt from payment of the commodity tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.010" offset="544031">Each of the parties moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.500" offset="557928">Petitioner arguing that as a matter of law, the remission of the tax on exportation constituted a bounty or grant, the government arguing the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.278" offset="605053">A three-judge panel of the Customs Court agreed with the petitioner and awarded a summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.666" offset="626578">On appeal, the Court of Customs on Patent Appeals, reversed in a 3 to 2 decision and on February of this year, this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.510" offset="665971">We say, Your Honors, that the tax remission clearly is a bounty or grant on exportation and that off setting duties called countervailing duties, should be assessed on imported products from Japan which benefit from the tax remission.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.526" offset="730023">The Countervailing Duty Law as it now exists has remained essentially unchanged since the first general countervailing duty law was enacted as Section 5 of the Tariff Act of 1897.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.319" offset="785194">Since that time the law was re-enacted five times and it was twice construed by this Court in the Downs case and in the Nicholas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.999" offset="827930">Both decisions make clear that the statute?s coverage is extremely broad and particularly with respect to the remission of tax and exportation that that event is a bounty or grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.086" offset="892296">In Downs, the first of the two of countervailing duty cases considered by this Court, the Court had before it a very complex Russian program which sought to control the production, price and exportation of sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.920" offset="955616">The scheme was extremely complicated, but it included two facts which this Court considered most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.094" offset="996368">Fact number one, all sugar sold domestically was subject to an excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.705" offset="1022803">Fact number two, all sugar exported from Russia was exported free of such tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.631" offset="1058434">The Court proceeded to state that whenever a tax is imposed upon all sugar produced, but is remitted on all sugar exported then by whatever process or in whatever manner or under whatever name it is disguised, it is a bounty upon exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.984" offset="1143907">Now, it is true there was another aspect of the Russian plan which the Court considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.147" offset="1168567">Exporters of sugar received certificates which were marketable and valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.291" offset="1193122">The Court discussed whether or not these certificates also constituted a bounty or grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.240" offset="1224887">The Court said that it did, but that does not detract from the Court?s very forceful language that the principle and the key facts in the entire scheme were the two that I mentioned to Your Honors, that all sugar sold in the home market was taxed and that all sugar exported was sold free of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.237" offset="1300851">This language of this Court declaring that the remission of tax under such circumstances is a bounty or grant, requiring the imposition of countervailing duties is not or was not unguarded language as the government would characterize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.265" offset="1368978">That language is consistent with repeated statements of this Court, both in the Downs case and in cases subsequent to and prior to Downs.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.734" offset="1410879">In the Nicholas case, the only other countervailing duty case this Court cited as an example of a bounty or grant on exportation, the remission of the tax when that tax is levied on products sold in the home market.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.538" offset="1462079">In an earlier case, in Passevant, the Court expressed its recognition as to why governments remit taxes on exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.074" offset="1504188">The Court said, ?Doubtless, to encourage exportation, to encourage the introduction of domestic goods into export markets, taxes are remitted on exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.843" offset="1551313">There was no mystery about the benefits of tax remission on exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.743" offset="1574928">The Court perceived the benefit and the Court deemed such a benefit to be a countervailable bounty or grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.210" offset="1604812">Notwithstanding the teachings of this Court which are quite clear, the Secretary of the Treasury has developed a practice under the countervailing duty law of excusing from countervail remissions of indirect tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.971" offset="1687776">The practice unquestionably conflicts with decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.472" offset="1709824">Now, as I said earlier, the Congress re-enacted the statute five times since 1897 and it re-enacted it several times after this Court?s Downs decision and after this Court?s Nicholas decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.933" offset="1767711">Of course, the Congress re-enacted the statute after the administrative practice began to be put into place.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.174" offset="1800625">A fundamental question arises, by re-enactment of the statute after this Court?s decision and after the administrative practice of the Secretary, what did Congress have in mind?</text>
            <text syncTime="441.882" offset="1847437">Did Congress intend to ratify the practice or did Congress intend to ratify this Court?s decisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="447.866" offset="1871365">The question is so simple --</text>

            <text syncTime="452.119" offset="1888397">That is always a possibility, Your Honor, except that I think it is a rather well settled principle that when Congress re-enacts a statute after a judicial interpretation of the statute becomes known to it, it is deemed to have ratified that interpretation.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="480.806" offset="2003127">But your point is that this Court did decide it, in the Downs case, is it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Fredrick L. Ikenson</label>
            <text syncTime="484.851" offset="2019323">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.954" offset="2023711">Our point is this. Congress was aware of the Downs case and certainly by the time of the last re-enactment in the Trade Act of 1974, it was aware of the Nicholas case, it was aware of the administrative practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.558" offset="2074180">How did Congress respond in the Trade Act of 1974?</text>
            <text syncTime="503.175" offset="2092674">Firstly, it opened the courts to American manufacturers by providing especially for judiciary review over negative countervailing duty determinations by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.626" offset="2138441">This enabled the American manufacturers who were aggrieved by the non-assessment of countervailing duties on imports which were benefited by tax remission on export to come to the courts and to invoke this Court?s teachings of Downs and Nicholas.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.923" offset="2215659">The Congress went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.651" offset="2226526">The key committees of the Congress discussed the administrative practice in the legislative history of the Trade Act and said that ?We are neither approving nor disapproving of that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.016" offset="2276054">They rather invited resolution of the question of the courts, by making judicial review available to American manufacturers, by stating clearly that they were not expressing approval or disapproval of the administrative practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.065" offset="2388172">The Solicitor General says that the actual countervailing duty that was assessed there was measured by the value of the certificates rather than the certificates plus the Russian tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.793" offset="2431117">Do you agree with that analysis as a matter of fact?</text>
            <text syncTime="590.361" offset="2441357">I know you would draw a different inference, but can we accept that as a correct interpretation?</text>

            <text syncTime="594.879" offset="2459434">I must preface my response to Your Honor by saying that the value of the grant in the Downs case was not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.557" offset="2494124">It was the understanding of the parties at the time and of the courts below that the amount of countervail was not judicially reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.593" offset="2526307">The sole question was whether or not the entire Russian scheme constituted a conferral of a bounty or grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.764" offset="2555042">So whether or not the actual amount of countervailing duty was correct was never put before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.519" offset="2585971">Now, to respond more directly to Your Honor?s question, the amount of countervail put on by the Secretary of the Treasury was equal to what the Secretary determined to be the profit gained by the Russian exporter by reason of the export certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.869" offset="2675414">I would not say that the amount of countervail equaled the value of the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.588" offset="2694327">It was based upon the Secretary?s determination of profit that was earned.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.824" offset="2811251">The Court looked differently at the value of the certificate than the Secretary of the Treasury, but I hope I have not given Your Honor too long an answer to a short question.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.765" offset="3679039">The Secretary did not offer any explanation as to his reason for not countervailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.021" offset="3704012">However, we do not claim that that is an error in this case because we view the role of the Customs Court as being a court that accords trial de novo, and we are not reviewing it under the general terms of general standards of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.859" offset="3795336">We look to an administrative record or the standards of arbitrariness and propitiousness and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.312" offset="3821145">We had a trial de novo available to us in the Customs Court and under those circumstances we do not feel that it was error for the Secretary not to have elaborated on his reasons for his negative determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.527" offset="3870046">I would like to comment briefly on a point made by the Chief Justice regarding the Congress? awareness of the sensitivity of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.691" offset="3918738">There is no question that Congress appreciates that the application of countervailing duties is a very delicate issue, that the application of countervailing duties by the United States unilaterally, certainly can cause international friction.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.459" offset="3989791">Congress was aware of this when it enacted the Trade Act and it devised a master plan to deal with countervailing duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.241" offset="4020929">On the one hand, it was concerned about promoting international harmony and international trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.937" offset="4043708">On the other hand, it was concerned about permitting domestic industry to stand by and suffer because it had to compete with unfair competition with bounty fed or subsidized competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.173" offset="4104625">So Congress struck a very delicate balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.368" offset="4117373">It directed the executive branch to try to negotiate an agreement on the application of countervailing duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.922" offset="4147675">On the other hand, it directed the Secretary of the Treasury to enforce the countervailing duty law by putting time limits on him in handling countervailing duty petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.105" offset="4196368">It also provided for judicial review of negative determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.604" offset="4218310">Congress had to do more to prevent American manufacturers? suits from upsetting the international applecart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.890" offset="4255509">So what Congress did was to give limited discretion to the Secretary of the Treasury to postpone the assessment of countervailing duties in cases where bounties or grants were bestowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.853" offset="4311306">This is the way that international friction could be avoided under the congressional plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.072" offset="4336279">This is what Congress provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.307" offset="4345161">However, the government was not content with this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.673" offset="4362611">Rather the government has chosen to call to Your Honor?s attention the alarming consequences that could follow from a reversal by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.944" offset="4399705">We say that those consequences need not occur and, furthermore Congress was aware of the danger of such consequences, it provided for it and any consideration of them by this Court would be unnecessary, it would be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.679" offset="4474624">It is not part of the Congressional contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.313" offset="4489148">I would reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal, Your Honors.</text>
