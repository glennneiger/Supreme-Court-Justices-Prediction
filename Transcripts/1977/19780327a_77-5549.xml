            <text syncTime="82.621" offset="410377">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.907" offset="415601">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.822" offset="427200">This case arises out of a state criminal prosecution in which the petitioner Michael Taylor was convicted of the offense of second degree robbery in violation of the criminal code of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.471" offset="473802">The two constitutional issues presented in this case are first whether the trial judge denied petitioner his due process guarantee under the federal constitution when he refused to instruct on the presumption of the innocence when he was requested to do so by the defense attorney and secondly whether or not the trial judge denied petitioner due process under the Federal Constitution when he refused to give the requested instruction on the indictment’s lack of evidentiary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.591" offset="602324">This is a relatively simple criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.310" offset="617162">The state presented only one witness to prove its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.862" offset="631373">That was Mr. James Maddox, the victim of the alleged robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.431" offset="649658">The defense presented one witness the petitioner Michael Taylor testifying in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.948" offset="675676">No other corroborative evidence was presented by the state of any sort physical or testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.464" offset="701799">An analysis of the facts that this case reveals that the at the inception of the trial during the voir dire of the jury, the defense attorney attempted to talk to the jurors concerning the presumption of innocence and the indictment’s lack of evidentiary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.375" offset="761462">The prosecutor referred to the defense attorney’s comments about the presumption of innocence, but did not speak at all during voir dire about the indictment’s lack of evidentiary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.810" offset="803154">In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that he would but one witness, the alleged robbery victim and that the essence of the Commonwealth’s evidence would include the fact that a warrant was taken against Michael Taylor by the prosecuting witness and that the grand jury had returned an indictment against Michael Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.358" offset="881312">He then was instructed by the trial judge to read the indictment to the jury which he did.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.414" offset="925616">I do not believe that they necessarily would be, but I believe the facts of this case make it a prime vehicle for focusing on the impact of the presumption of the innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.215" offset="960829">In this case, it was clearly the word of one man against the word of another and if the status of the defendant as a person who has been arrested, indicted and arraigned is to be used as any indicia of guilt against him, this could be the crucial factor in this case to swing the jury to convict this man in a very, very close case and that is why I have focused on the facts in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.073" offset="1064169">Without belaboring the facts, I would also like to point to the fact that under the direct examination of this prosecution witness, the prosecutor elicited from him that he had indeed reported this crime immediately to the police that he had obtained a warrant against the petitioner and that he had testified before the grand jury seeking the indictment which of course was eventually returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.809" offset="1159151">Also the case boiled down to the fact that the defense admitted that Michael Taylor knew the robbery victim that he had been to his apartment on three or so occasions and he adamantly denied that he had participated in this robbery or that he was present on the night of alleged crime February 16, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.155" offset="1248594">At this point with the evidence in this posture the parties met with the trial judge on the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.114" offset="1272418">At that time the trial defense attorney requested and tendered instructions on the presumption of innocence and the indictment’s lack of evidentiary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.082" offset="1312228">The trial judge refused to give those instructions and gave no comparable version of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.214" offset="1332813">Instead he instructed on only three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.969" offset="1343784">One, the substantive elements of the offense of second degree robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.397" offset="1361547">Two, he told the jury about reasonable doubt and gave a general definition of reasonable doubt and third, he instructed them that their verdict must be unanimous In this configuration that the --</text>

            <text syncTime="342.410" offset="1449528">At that point, the defense attorney still trying to talk to the jury, talked to them about the presumption of innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.794" offset="1587141">Normally, the prosecutor gives a synopsis of the charge in his opening statement and I want to make it clear Your Honor that it is not an attack made on the procedure of the telling the jurors about the content of the indictment or reading it to them or even giving it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.771" offset="1647013">The problem seems to be in this context is that there is a conflict between being allowed to do this on the part of the prosecution in having some means of guaranteeing that the presumption of innocence is not overridden by a mistake on the part of the jury that the indictment is in some way evidence of the defendant’s guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.072" offset="1724231">In this posture what the defense attorney attempted to do was what is done in very many jurisdictions and that is to have the trial judge give a cautionary instruction that the indictment could not be considered as having any evidentiary value in the case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="426.003" offset="1783895">Would you think that that would be more important, more critical in the situation where as in some jurisdictions the indictment goes to the jury room with the jurors along with other pieces of paper that are evidence?</text>

            <text syncTime="440.415" offset="1841573">Your Honor, it might be in certain cases, but I will say in this case there was not one exhibit introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.811" offset="1859128">This jury did not have this slightest concept of what an exhibit was.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.744" offset="1870935">All the evidence they heard came from the witness stand or statements were made in the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.179" offset="1892669">So they would have no way really to differentiate a paper exhibit, a documentary exhibit from testimonial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.211" offset="1920777">So they were looking at what had they had heard in that courtroom and they had heard the prosecutor under instruction of the judge read them in complete verbatim form the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.784" offset="1959020">So I think that while your distinction is valid and certainly comes to the play in many situations such as some of the cases I have cited in the brief, it is not really crucial in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.620" offset="1998413">I think we have to look at the interplay that we have in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.459" offset="2013773">There are two things that occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.885" offset="2019520">Number one, the trial judge never tells in his instruction to jury that the defendant is presumed innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.581" offset="2050240">Number two, he does not give them an instruction that the indictment lacks evidentiary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.419" offset="2077616">Add to this, the fact that even his reasonable doubt instruction that he gives to jury does not deal with the burden of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.600" offset="2110321">Nowhere in any of those instructions that he gave does he ever say the burden of proof is on the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.967" offset="2135817">Indeed, his instruction begins on the substantive offense with a statement “You will find the defendant guilty under this instruction if and only if you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt all of the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.619" offset="2186390">When he goes into his instruction on a reasonable doubt he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.757" offset="2198929">If upon the whole case you have a reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt, you will find him not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.033" offset="2220036">Number one, no statement that there is a presumption of innocence accorded to this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.970" offset="2239784">Number two, no statement that the prosecution bears the burden of proof proving the man guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.877" offset="2263399">Number three, this prosecutor did two things that coalesce both of these arguments together.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.767" offset="2287013">Number one, he knew that the indictment had been read to the jury and he questioned this one witness that he had whether or not he had appeared before the grand jury and testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.742" offset="2330899">It looks to be on the face of it that what it was an attempt to bootstrap that one witness’ identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.832" offset="2355245">In other words, it is an indirect way of saying did you testify before the grand jury,</text>
            <text syncTime="573.221" offset="2372800">Yes I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.867" offset="2379382">Did they bring back an indictment?</text>
            <text syncTime="576.171" offset="2384607">Yes they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.908" offset="2387533">The grand jury believed you.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.645" offset="2394533">That was another reason why this cautionary instruction was so important as this Court pointed out in Estelle v. Williams to guarantee the presumption of innocence in the fundamental fair trial guarantee, you will look with close judicial scrutiny and practices and procedures they conflict with the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.595" offset="2462347">I submit that in this case, the refusal to give the instruction on the indictment’s lack of evidentiary value conflicted with the defendant’s constitutional guarantee of a presumption of innocence, but look also at what this particular prosecutor did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.655" offset="2518563">He had just heard prior to his closing argument, the trial judge refused to give an instruction on the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.850" offset="2615320">What did he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="617.358" offset="2549387">One of the very first things he said in his closing argument was the defendant like every other defendant who has ever tried, who is in the penitentiary or in the reformatory today has the presumption of innocence until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, that is just a presumption in his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.691" offset="2618664">Number one, he equated the presumption of innocence with the concept of the people who had been tried, convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.891" offset="2647503">Number two, he indicated that the presumption of innocence really does not have any validity in a criminal trial because it certainly did not protect to all those people who are presently confined in the penitentiaries of penal institutions of Kentucky at the time of their trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.021" offset="2700062">Number two, he misstated, clearly misstated the definition of reasonable doubt which was given by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.838" offset="2731304">He told the jurors that a reasonable doubt in this case was a big doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.971" offset="2747813">He also told them, here he is, this prosecutor is faced with absolutely no evidence, but the complaining witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.492" offset="2773936">What did he say?</text>
            <text syncTime="674.655" offset="2778533">He said the absence of evidence in this case clearly equates with the defendant’s guilt.</text>

Naugten and Kibbe vs. Henderson, this Court said that you must evaluate all of the instructions and I submit that this particular instruction while it may not be constitutionally bankrupt on the issue of reasonable doubt, it is deficient because it did not allot the jury to utilize the fact that reasonable doubt could be generated for the want of or lack of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.538" offset="3198060">That was their position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.752" offset="10702935">But it was concluded that the burden known as it is now is the bowman of Commonwealth to make its case and in this case we submit that that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.334" offset="10749224">A tendered instruction number three, tendered instruction number four, all speak for themselves, all have things in them that are evidence and this is not evidence in the very case that was cited by the defendant, proves that were in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.716" offset="10810769">For example number four there, the law presumes the defendant to be innocent of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.919" offset="10835637">That is all right it could stop there, thus, the defendant although accused against the crime was clean slate that is, he does not say if no proof or heard and be entitled in an acquittal or dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.832" offset="10895301">They have to put this all this other in there and he ends up saying so that presumption of innocence alone is sufficient to equip the defendant so lack of proof alone that is sufficient and as far as the indictment goes in take it in reading it is a common practice in Commonwealth for the defense to get up and take the paper and say this is a piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.025" offset="11000000">He has a piece of paper with a little indictment on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.559" offset="11022151">This piece of paper is worth just as much as that until they put proof on which might substantiate what is on that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.216" offset="11052767">Those arguments are all are used and as far as presumption of innocence goes, I want to say this to this Court, I have practiced law 41 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.796" offset="11099160">The great book of which was a defense attorney and I have yet in the Commonwealth to hear a crowd start out in which the thing they get first is the individual's name as was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.752" offset="11182961">The second thing they get are you acquainted with the fact that this man must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.957" offset="11243774">He has presumed to be innocent until that point is reached and then whenever they say yes, every single juror in this case, every one of them was asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.738" offset="11290899">They went back to have a discussion on it in chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.946" offset="11303751">It was argued all on that side and if you are good counsel is with getting that in front of the jury and one of the favorites that we would use down our way we would say, “Look this is a presumption of innocence and you talk you can mention and say this was brought up in voir dire and a man is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty as stated by the instructions in this Court and then they will turn to the judge and say now Your Honor if I have misstated it please inform me wherein I have erred and you have got it in front of the jury far more and if the judge will either confirm it or deny.</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.061" offset="11540212">And if some quotations that would appear is there and it shows that it went at great length into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.654" offset="11570514">The other thing that was brought out about this slate clean was that they were trying to make this man who worked on a liquor store probably knowing that some people were prejudiced against him for drives appear that he was not comparable with the man who had robbed him and who was in there using employing this vehicle for trying to gather an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.802" offset="11699141">The last thing he has here in his second question is that of having an instruction as to the lack of value of an indictment that it is not evidence where a clean slate was that it is not evidence</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.902" offset="11835500">The Court has those case are all Federal cases, we do not argue with them, but those are cases where they took Mr. Chief Justice, the indictment back into the jury room and where they could place embankment down and read it and reread it and these Federal Courts have held and very properly so that if you are going to do that then an instruction is going to cockney to let that jury know that is not evidence and that should be the law and no where in those cases is there any consideration given to the instruction that the indictment lacks evidentiary value in Kentucky or that it is a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.626" offset="12042390">Yet counsel for the petitioner continues to contend that because of decided cases the petitioner was entitled to an instruction on the indictment’s lack of evidentiary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.071" offset="12096202">The burden of proving that such an instruction is a Constitutional Right is not upon the Commonwealth, but it is upon the petitioner alleging and this burden the defendant has not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.831" offset="12187213">Some total of the evidence in this case can leave little doubt that there was nothing more imbued than the minds of those 12 jurors than the doctrine of the presumption that a man is presumed to be guilty until proven beyond a reasonable doubt and that instruction gave him, given by the judge and that judge has labored so hard to practice and record speak for it to be surely guided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.288" offset="12337051">Let him make a statement now, let him come back after the argument, after the court and put other statements on the record and I do not know what more he could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.201" offset="12388773">You could not expect him to abdicate his right to prepare instructions over to defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.149" offset="12424509">I never could get him to do it so that is the sum total of the entire picture as I see it and it looks like my time is about up and I do not want to run over my friend Mr. Aprile did, but I think this is a very important case to Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.582" offset="12514266">The ruling in Kentucky leaves more leeway, wider space, and a presumption of innocence is just one thread in the fabric and it is much better for when advocacy points of view you got more room to roam than you do in many of the other states.</text>
