            <text syncTime="490.673" offset="2042631">The older cases clearly pointed out that size and weight are elements of safety and may be taken into account by legislatures in regulating highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.221" offset="2084845">The leading case in 1938, South Carolina v. Barnwell said that regulation of the use of State highways is peculiarly of local concern and the Court has never reiterated from this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.335" offset="2149315">It also said such regulations are inseparable from a substantial effect in the interstate commerce, and there they announced the test, this rational basis test whether the legislature in adopting the regulations has acted within its province and whether the means shows are reasonably adopted to the insight.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.218" offset="2228832">They went onto point out that the State may impose nondiscriminatory restrictions as safety measures and said the Court does not sit as a legislature and that the reasonableness and wisdom are not for the Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Lederer</label>
            <text syncTime="1288.271" offset="5233018">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.854" offset="5243362">In answer to your question Mr. Justice Stewart on interchanging these vehicles, it is true that each of the vans of a twin trailer can be hauled separately by a twin trailer tractor, but a twin trailer tractor is a different piece of equipment than a semi trailer tractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.570" offset="5318177">A twin trailer cannot be interchanged with a semi trailer tractor and similarly a semi trailer van cannot be placed on a twin trailer tractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.759" offset="5354957">Thus Wisconsin by forcing use of semi trailers in the State of Wisconsin and through the State of Wisconsin interferes with interchanging of equipment, because the Wisconsin equipment is not compatible with the equipment used in the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.461" offset="5421831">The equipment which is the industry standard for general commodity carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.763" offset="5447013">I think it is pertinent in this case that the State Highway Commission where the authors of the administrative regulation which bans the twin trailers of any length or prevents permits for being issued for them, the Chairman of the Commission was asked whether he had any opinion as to the safety of these vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.646" offset="5526530">He stated that he was not prepared to comment on that and would choose not to comment on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.010" offset="5547950">No Wisconsin highway official has testified that twin trailers are unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.763" offset="5571042">Indeed the only Wisconsin highway official who had an opinion as to their safety, Mr. James Carn (ph) who was the Motor Vehicle Commissioner of the State, testified that he had reviewed the record, not the record in this case, but he had reviewed various reports and surveys in preparing to testify before a public hearing and he had concluded that twin trailers were safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.027" offset="5660068">No one in this entire record has stated that twin trailers are unsafe, no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.289" offset="5685145">The consistent opinion of the experts, the consistent opinion of State officials who had experience with these vehicles is that they are safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.367" offset="5717432">I think this factor removes this case from other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.356" offset="5733419">The Court is not called upon the second guess the State legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.810" offset="5751183">Here the State legislature or the Highway Commission more properly has made a decision apparently on no data, but it is done as it permitted in anachronism to exist in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.096" offset="5792352">They are unable to justify the burden that they have imposed on interstate commerce by anything other than the supposition that it might serve safety and that supposition has been destroyed by the evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.151" offset="5848567">Only if there is an irrebuttable presumption, a presumption where it does not matter what the facts are, an irrebuttable presumption that vehicle size is tied to safety to I think that the State of Wisconsin should prevail in this case because that is the sole thing that they have going for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.510" offset="5922023">The presumption and the assumption which seems a reasonable one the surface that larger vehicles are less safe vehicles, that is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.260" offset="5964969">I thank the Court.</text>
