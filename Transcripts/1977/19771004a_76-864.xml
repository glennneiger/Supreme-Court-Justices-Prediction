            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79997">We will hear arguments next in 76-864, City of Lafayette against Louisiana Power &amp; Light.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.978" offset="287827">Mr. Hochberg, I think you can proceed when you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="jerome_a_hochberg" startTime="56.063" stopTime="336.852">
            <label>Mr. Jerome A. Hochberg</label>
            <text syncTime="56.063" offset="304232">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.807" offset="319174">The question presented by this case is whether cities, political sub-divisions of states are subject to causes of action in trouble-damage liability under the Federal Antitrust Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.689" offset="366717">We are here on a writ of certiorari and the case arises out of a complaint filed by the petitioners, the City of Lafayette and Plaquemine charging the respondent, the Louisiana Power &amp; Light Company, two other investor owned utilities and a parent of LP&amp;L with violations of the Antitrust Laws in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power and energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.949" offset="463788">LP&amp;L in turn filed a counter claim charging the cities with antitrust violations in the conduct of the city electric utility systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.429" offset="509659">Cities moved to dismiss in the district court on the grounds of Parker v. Brown barred any action under the Federal Antitrust Laws against them and the district court relying on Parker dismissed the grant of the motion and entered judgment pursuant to Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure against LP&amp;L.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.336" offset="597326">LP&amp;L then appealed to the Fifth Circuit and during the dependency of that appeal this Court came down with the Goldfarb ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.465" offset="625852">The Fifth Circuit then reversed the district court relying on Goldfarb and said that the cities were not automatically outside the scope of antitrust laws and that in order to come within the state action doctrine, they would have to have had legislative approval for this specific conduct under challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.468" offset="709861">Certiorari was granted by this Court after a petition by the cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.812" offset="731177">The cities operate their electric utility systems, they own and operate and pursuant to broad statutory authority from the Louisiana legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.358" offset="773391">What is involved here is not whether cities are beyond the law, but simply whether cities as governmental bodies, wholly governmental bodies are subject to the antitrust laws and they travel down to the judgments that come with them for conduct engaged in by city officials in the official performance of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.913" offset="851550">In addition, we are not here just talking about electric utility service for the city, we are talking about the myriad of services in operation that the cities engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.533" offset="890106">In order to make this determination it seems to me, this Court has said in Parker v. Brown that because the statute itself does not answer the question in specific words that we must look to the statutory purpose to legislative history, the subject matter and the context of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.059" offset="972131">I think we should also look to the adverse effects, a weird adverse effects from enforcement of these laws against city officials and city governments and the impingement that it will create on a fundamental policy in this country, the policy of local choice in ordering social and economic needs, in providing local choice on matters, on governmental matters closest to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.947" offset="1075785">In Parker, this Court unequivocally stated in broad language that the statutory purpose in the passage of the Sherman Act was to curb concentrations of private economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.983" offset="1131896">The Court stated that it was clear through pages of legislative history that the Congress was aiming at private individuals and business corporations and of course at that time there were the Great Sugar Trust, the Oil Trust and the railroads running rampant and that was the basis for the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.375" offset="1205457">The Court further said that there was not a hint in the legislative history of the purpose or effect to apply these laws to state government, state officials or agents of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.991" offset="1263866">34 years have gone by since that decision and that clear message, and Congress has not seen fit to alter the decision or the principles that underlie.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.350" offset="1309319">I submit that cities as well as state agents and state officials come within the purview of that decision, for cities are but political subdivisions of states to whom the state delegates power, its power that it gets from the people as a state for the more convenient and effective governance of the people at a level closer to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.035" offset="1404092">In addition, cities like states only act for public purposes, not for private gang.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="336.852" stopTime="366.569">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="336.852" offset="1427393">Well, suppose a city or make it more comprehensive a state, the state of Louisiana organized an airline with 50 or 75 airplanes, the usual pattern of airline operations and then engaged in monopolistic or price fixing or other statutory violations, what would be your view of that?</text>

            <text syncTime="366.569" offset="1546198">I would say that that would not be subject to antitrust attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.902" offset="1559573">However, it might be subject to other remedies under the constitution and the commerce power and Congress of course to the commerce power could enact the legislation to perhaps deal with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.773" offset="1615057">If it effected intrastate commerce, I believe they could yes.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="387.129" offset="1628431">Let me change the question a little bit. Suppose a city conspired with a private entity, is not there a language Parker itself that suggests that a city is then liable under antitrust Laws?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_a_hochberg" startTime="401.453" stopTime="485.048">
            <label>Mr. Jerome A. Hochberg</label>
            <text syncTime="401.453" offset="1685796">I know the language you refer to Mr. Justice Blackmun and I think just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.383" offset="1701470">I think that that language appears in a list of three kinds of conduct in which the Court in Parker was saying the state could not immunize persons from -- they could not authorize illegal activity by individuals and corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.318" offset="1765208">They could not endorse it and a private person who conspires with a governmental body would not be immune from antitrust prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.924" offset="1803661">And I say that because those three items are mentioned in a discussion in the opinion dealing with the defendants who are private members, who are private individuals, the growers and the handlers who were operating the raising program under the supervision of the State Prorate Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.664" offset="1870639">The defendants who were the Prorate Committee, I suppose the commission were private persons and those comments by the Court were made in the context of what was being described that the private parties were engaging in under State supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.866" offset="1935422">So I think it is just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.576" offset="1942214">I might add that at that point the Court in Parker also seem to equate a state with a city in that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.452" offset="1977741">Now, there are severe consequences it seems to me from applying laws which were aimed at private enterprise to governments.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.908" offset="2091530">It is not a question of immunity, but the Congress never intended to apply to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.411" offset="4357600">For example, all of them seem to want to draw a line between proprietary and governmental functions, a line that has been discredited in the past and rejected by this Court in numerous cases, most recently in the Indian Towing case in 1950 I believe and a line which the lower court, the court below the Fifth Circuit equally rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.699" offset="4442759">The problem there is well described by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his opinion in the Indian Towing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.987" offset="4463866">In addition, the Justice Department proposes a regulatory non-regulatory line and that line seems to me just like proprietary and governmental (Inaudible) wash because to give you an example, if the city has franchised someone else to deliver a service and instructed it, the private entity to conduct itself anti competitively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.034" offset="4568043">The city would not be under the Justice Department test, the city would not be subject to prosecution under the antitrust laws, but if the citizens of the city decide they would rather deliver the service themselves because they feel it is more effective that way, more responsive to their needs and did the same thing they had told the private entity to do, the Justice Department would want to sue the city for that and I submit that makes no sense in the long run.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.456" offset="5269796">In Cantor the Public Service Commission was not going to be sued or was not sued and I doubt that this -- my feeling is that I do not think this Court would hold that Public Service Commission is subject to the antitrust laws for endorsing that tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.752" offset="5318906">All of these lines that the city and the respond -- the Justice Department and the respondent in the various amici proposed are it seems to me totally inconsistent with the Parker language, with the statutory purpose of the Sherman Act and with the legislative history of Congress in enacting that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.718" offset="5402812">The only line I submit that is consistent with that legislative history and statutory purpose is when wholly governmental bodies are excluded from the antitrust laws and private parties or private parties with self regulatory functions granted by the state would be subject to those antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.042" offset="5492150">And the reason I say that is that there is not a hint in the legislative history that Congress intended to apply the antitrust laws to some levels of government and not to other levels of government or to some conduct of government and not to other conduct of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.841" offset="5547321">In point of fact Congress said, we are passing these antitrust laws to aim them and curb private economic power and there was not a hint that they were aiming them at government at any level.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.368" offset="5593401">Is there as bright a line as you suggest between governmental bodies and non-governmental bodies?</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.752" offset="5619001">Let me go back to my example of a power district that is authorized to be formed by the land owners within a particular geographic area and to govern itself and to supply power itself by the state legislature and it is a non-profit type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.949" offset="5687755">Now, I would think of that as a governmental function in many senses and your answer was I think that, that would probably be subject to the antitrust laws?</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.136" offset="5748464">In that situation it seems to me this Court would have or any federal court would have to make a determination whether it was truly, a wholly governmental body just as this court did and in NLRB v. Natural Gas Utility District where it had to determine whether the district was a political sub-division of the state so that it came within the exemption of the labor laws and there the Court rejecting of course local law, state law as a means of governing whether a federal statute applies decided that, that district was indeed a political sub-division by looking through various factors like was it responsible to an elected official or to the legislature ultimately and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.742" offset="5906870">Again, I say that in order to hold city subject to the antitrust laws here and after all they are criminal statutes and I doubt that, it seems to me very doubtful that the Congress would have enacted the Sherman Law to apply the city governments in criminal as they were, without some indication in the legislative history that was what they were intending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.296" offset="5985133">In order to subject cities to antitrust laws, I think this Court would have to repudiate the message of Parker and impute the Congress and intention it never expressed and to then go about rationalizing the important public policy of local choice and local governance with the antitrust policy and throw into that nix in addition a weighing of the severe consequences that might occur from application of these laws and put them altogether and try and divine a line or several lines with caveats and sub caveats for holding antitrust -- city subject to antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.002" offset="7191990">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.107" offset="7204425">I am Andrew Carter from New Orleans, Louisiana here representing Louisiana Power &amp; Light Company, often referred to as LP&amp;L.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.764" offset="7246952">I have deeded five minutes of time to one of the amicus and hope I will not regret it with my slow talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.763" offset="7295017">I will try my best to make it through own time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.603" offset="7314348">If it pleases the court, the city's counsel here has glossed over the four allegations of antitrust conduct and I believe that taking up one of those examples might furnish the Court a little understanding with why LP&amp;L is bothered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.634" offset="7414449">LP&amp;L is primarily a rural electric utility company, engaged in furnishing service in 46 of the 64 county areas which we call parishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.230" offset="7476830">In those parish areas, there are some cities and towns and in some of those cities and towns they have electric, gas and water systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.528" offset="7514028">In recent years they have been going into the outlying areas with their water and gas and electric service and we run into the proposition now more often increasingly where the cities will tell customers or potential customers that in order for them to get water and gas, they will have to take their electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.320" offset="7653208">This is done sometimes with a new customer just moving into the area, sometimes with one that LP&amp;L is already serving or a rural electric co-op, like our friends here on our side of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.214" offset="7704826">So this is a practice it seems to us to be a classic tie and arrangement and it is one of the things we are after here to see if we can stop it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.260" offset="7752996">Now, I have read the city's briefs of course and I have listened the counsel today and it seems to me that counsel is in due deference to an adding a great deal to what he is advancing to call it a principle, what he is saying here is simply a superficial preposition that if the courts look at the actor involved and they find out that the actor is a state agency or political sub-division then the inquiry stops right there and you are through right at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.110" offset="7924359">Now, that makes it quite obvious why counsel did not talk about any of the full pertinent cases in this line of jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.105" offset="7956333">It started with Parker because every last one of them shoot down that preposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.498" offset="8229888">This Court looked right at what was going on as to the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.820" offset="8255174">It found out that the activity had been mandated, had been compelled by the state through its sovereign exercise of the legislature and so it held that there was a state exemption and I think one sentence is the key to the holding in Parker v. Brown and it reads this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.554" offset="8342110">The state in adopting and enforcing the Prorate program made no contract or agreement and ended into no conspiracy and restrain of trade or to establish monopoly, but as sovereign, as sovereign imposed the restraint as an act of government which the Sherman Act did not undertake to prohibit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.393" offset="13161493">For in that year, a line, an electric line, operating on alternating current was opened to carry 480 kilo watts of single phase power at 4000 volts and a 125 cycles per second, 14 miles from Klamath Falls, Oregon to the city of Portland and it was the first time when it was demonstrated that there would be economic feasibility for large unit central station power in this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.541" offset="13298061">It was over 50 years, however, before the rural segment of our society became accessible to that great technology and that came about in the years immediately after World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.013" offset="13355948">As a result of the fact, that the Congress in 1936 enacted the Rural Electrification Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.984" offset="13391893">Its purpose was to make feasible, electric power accessible to every rural American and for all practical purposes, that objective has been accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.880" offset="13439435">I bring you in the name of those co-operatives, what I think is a unique situation both legally and factually that has a bearing upon how this Court should rule in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.084" offset="13492307">In fact, I say to you and perhaps this is too strong to start with, that unless you resolve the issue in our favor, there will remain an untenable, legal dichotomy because of these particular facts and this particular law that I want to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.909" offset="13575586">Throughout this country in most states, the municipalities have the power to expropriate, going electric business properties in most cases co-operatives and in some states of electric power company's, in Louisiana they may do it with respect to both the co-operatives and the power companies and they have done so many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.952" offset="13671716">This of course affords a due process, just compensation proceeding whereby there is remuneration for resulting damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.610" offset="13718423">On the other hand, not even in states, where such powers maybe statutorily exercised by either a municipality or a public utility district, may that power be exercised lawfully is do so is to substantially impair the national objective of rural electrification because to do so would be to frustrate federal's premise of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.588" offset="13822286">Now, what I am praying for you here is this dichotomy, if Louisiana city is permitted to prevail in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.568" offset="13854260">On the one hand, even having the power to expropriate our properties through due process and pursuant to the Fifth Amendment, they cannot go so far as to destroy our properties if the result is to impair the remainder of what we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.817" offset="13915177">Under that theory in this case, they may piecemeal and in certain instances (Inaudible) and large spread for sub division purposes, come out and commit acts which we would be held not only civilly, but criminally accountable for piecemeal or large spread and accomplish precisely the same result without being redressable under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.995" offset="14019876">Now, we say just this to you in conclusion, that is dirty ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.613" offset="14046417">That is unfair and one tenant, I think all of us would agree is a fundamental attempt of construction is separate is that you do not construe a statute if the result is to be probably injust, absurd and unfair and that is what we say to you will be the case if you rule as the cities have asked you to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.392" offset="14153519">In part may I say whether we can agree that this is a statutory construction or not, if what the cities are doing in there tie in arrangements which is a per se violation of Sherman and Clayton for us is it is not Marilyn in say, surely if its not, it ought to be Marilyn prohibitin.</text>
