          <turn speaker="stephen_r_barnett" startTime="55.684" stopTime="517.400">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="55.684" offset="302673">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.139" offset="320541">As the Court will recall, we are dealing here with an oil and gas lease, Actually two of them but I think they can be reduced to one for purposes of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.638" offset="366516">A lease running for a term of 50 years to the Mineral estate underlying the Waddell Ranch in West Texas, where the lessee, Gulf was selling the gas from the reserves under the Waddell Ranch in interstate commerce pursuant to Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity granted by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.150" offset="460557">The question presented is whether when the 50 year lease expires, Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, requires the lessors, Southland Royalty and others, that is the holders of the reversionary interest in the mineral estate to obtain Abandonment Authority from the Commission before they may stop that service of interstate, may stop that service of supplying gas to interstate commerce and divert that flow of gas instead to the intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.035" offset="612067">Now, first I would like to explain why we take the position that what is dedicated to interstate commerce here and hence cannot be abandoned without the Commission’s approval under Section 7(b), is the service of supplying gas to the interstate market from these reserves underlying the Waddell Ranch, the reserves from which the gas was continuing to flow to the interstate market, at the moment that the lease expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.963" offset="739754">Now, respondents brief throughout their brief and my colleague Mr. Attwell spoke throughout his argument last time, as though what was involved here was two distinct bodies of gas, two physically distinct bodies of gas, Gulf’s gas and Southland’s gas, as they put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.699" offset="814777">Thus in respondent’s brief at page 13 it is stated, the Commission held that Southland Royalty’s gas was dedicated to interstate service because Gulf had made an interstate sale of Gulf’s leasehold gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.851" offset="871306">Whether Gulf thus dedicated Southland Royalty’s gas, is the issue before this Court; that is the respondent’s view of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.444" offset="901713">In pursuit of this theory, the respondents analogized the case to the situation of vertical or horizontal limitations on interstate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.540" offset="950092">The case where, where a producer limits vertically to a certain distance below the ground, the gas that is being sold interstate or where a producer limited horizontally, say to 500 acres of a thousand acre track, or respondents analogized the case to that of a split stream where certain producers owning shares in a producing property, make interstate sales of their gas while other producers make intrastate sales of their shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.007" offset="1095959">And respondents say that this case is in their terms, simply the case of a severance in time rather than a severance in space.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.400" offset="1137546">Quote, from their brief at page 12, “the severance between a fixed term lease hold interest and a mineral fee interest is a severance in time rather than a horizontal or a vertical severance in space”.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.835" offset="1195329">And to respondents, they are both the same and this case should be analogized to the others, as Mr. Attwell said last time, it is just as if Gulf owned Black Acre and Southland owned White Acre, the parcels are that separate and so the Court of Appeals held here, applying Texas Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.686" offset="1274741">Well, there are several reasons why we think this analogy is no good, why we think a severance in time, that is the severance created here between the leasehold and the reversionary estate is quite different for purposes of the Natural Gas Act from the spatial severances to which respondents would analogize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.995" offset="1351959">First of all, the argument ignores the certificates that were granted to Gulf here.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.024" offset="1368051">The certificates granted to Gulf here were not limited in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.691" offset="1382679">Now in this case, we know that it is clearly as we ever could because the very certificates that were granted to Gulf for this particular, for the reserves under the Waddell Ranch, were before this Court, in the Sun Oil case and were expressly held there not to be limited in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.303" offset="1453210">That is the first thing we find wrong with the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.550" offset="1466167">But more important, the attempt to analogize the severance, the so called severance in time here, with these limitations of space is quite inconsistent with the language and purposes of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.402" offset="1537533">There is first of all a physical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.034" offset="1548087">In the case of the vertical or horizontal limitation on the interstate sale, the stream never flows in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.110" offset="1596361">In the first place, there is simply a limitation on the amount of gas that flows in interstate commerce in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.178" offset="1620707">There is no stream flowing in interstate commerce that would be shut off and diverted to intrastate commerce as would happen here, if respondents prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.958" offset="1663757">That is the heart of this case, respondents here claim that by virtue of their state is there is a certain kind of property owner under Texas Law, they may cut off a stream of gas from given reserves, that is flowing to interstate commerce at the end of this lease and diverted physically to the intrastate market instead without having to get the Commissions Abandonment Authority under Section 7 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="421.672" offset="1766679">Now, the distinction here is crucial with respect to the purpose of Section B and indeed of the entire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.239" offset="1796877">That purpose as this Court emphasized in Sunray among other cases is to protect the continuity of service to the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.286" offset="1837105">The stability of natural gas prices and supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.947" offset="1855705">Well, in the case of the vertical or horizontal limitation on the sale, the interstate market never comes to rely on that sale because the gas is never flowing to the interstate market in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.556" offset="1914219">The interstate consumers cannot become dependent on the part of the gas reserve, on the part of the gas who would now be reserved for intrastate use because that part never entered interstate commerce in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.147" offset="1964583">Here in contrast, the stream of gas from the reserves underlying the Waddell Ranch has supplied El Paso’s interstate costumers since 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.760" offset="2007006">El Paso and its costumers have come to rely on that supply and indeed the amount of gas involved in this case represents more than 1% of El Paso’s total annual foreign supply of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.680" offset="2058624">That is in the record of Appendix page 375.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.474" offset="2073879">Further, if El Paso loses this case, and if the Commission loses this case, the amount of gas that El Paso would now have to return to Southland and the other reversionary owners under the Protective Agreement, now amounts to 37 million MCF, that is—</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_barnett" startTime="527.113" stopTime="528.151">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="527.113" offset="2188400">Well the point is—</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="528.151" offset="2192580">To the legal issues involved in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_barnett" startTime="529.896" stopTime="925.525">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="529.896" offset="2199581">Well, the point is that that gas would have to come out of the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.775" offset="2219016">It would have to come out of supplies that El Paso would otherwise to be able to provide to the interstate market and that illustrates the purpose of the Natural Gas Act which is involved in this case, which is to assure supply to the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.200" offset="2284740">Further, so as I was saying, the basic purpose of the Act it seems to us, distinguishes sharply between the flow that has began and would not be cut off by what respondents call a severance in time and a horizontal or vertical limitation or a split stream limitation where the gas never flows to the interstate market in the first place and thus there is no reliance on it and no continuity to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.660" offset="2398634">Further, we submit that the very language of Section 7(b), the very word abandonment, distinguishes between a severance in time and a spatial severance.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.811" offset="2455163">A Statutory requirement that a service may not be abandoned is precisely a command that a severance in time is not permitted, that is what abandonment means.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.481" offset="2501869">Now if the Statute also had a provision that prohibited any spatial segmentation, that prohibited any percentage segmentation of a gas reserve, then it might be appropriate to argue the severances in space, can be analogized to severances in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.837" offset="2571251">But there is no such provision; the very purpose and meaning of abandonment is that you cannot stop something that has been started, that a severance in time is to be distinguished from a severance in space.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.490" offset="2617958">Now, this is supported also by this Court’s decisions, for example, the Lo-Vaca case, California versus Lo-Vaca Gathering 379 US 366, cited in El Paso’s brief, holds that we submit that once gas flows in interstate commerce, it is subjected to the Commission’s Jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.168" offset="2704580">That even without a sale for resale in interstate commerce, Federal Jurisdiction follows the flow as the Court there said.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.716" offset="2738852">That too distinguishes the so called spatial severance which would cut off a flow that has began from the cases, I am sorry, the so called Temporal Severance that would cut off a flow that has begun, from the spatial cases, where the flow never starts in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.307" offset="2825161">Now, we submit here that what has been dedicated on the facts of this case by Gulf's sale in interstate commerce is a service in interstate commerce and service is a key concept under Section 7 as this Court held in Sunray of course, a service of supplying gas from the particular reserves underlying the Waddell Ranch.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.190" offset="2932681">And that that service, that stream of gas running from these particular reserves has been dedicated by Gulf’s sale and may not be abandoned without the Commission’s approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.148" offset="2984508">Now, Southland has in fact taken a rather similar position with which we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.301" offset="3013138">In Southland’s brief before the Commission, which appears in the record at page A 476, Southland said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.795" offset="3055143">I am reading from A 476, preliminarily, mineral interest owners that Southland and the other reversioners, agree with El Paso’s statement, that once dedicated to interstate commerce, gas reserves may not be removed from interstate commerce without abandonment authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.785" offset="3139048">Gas reserves may not be removed from interstate commerce without abandonment authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.050" offset="3160155">That of course is what would happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.490" offset="3169873">This gas at the end of the, at termination of the lease is flowing from the particular reserves under the Waddell Ranch.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.278" offset="3201115">Our position is that that flow may not be terminated until the reserves are exhausted without the Commission’s approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.363" offset="3233403">Southland appeared there to have taken the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.487" offset="3245941">We would cite other support for this notion that Section 7 applies to the flow until the reserves are exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.038" offset="3280109">In the Hunt case, in the 5th Circuit, 306 Fed 2nd 334, which the Commission relied on and which we quoted in our brief, the Court says that the obligation to continue serving is like the ancient covenant running with the land, I am sorry, like the ancient covenant running with the land, the duty to continue to deliver and sell flows with the gas from the moment of the first delivery down to the exhaustion of the reserve or until the Commission on appropriate terms permits the session of service under Section 7(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="836.547" offset="3426186">I might here and since this case talked about a covenant running with the land, say a word in response to the argument that our colleagues from Texas have made, they ague that this notion of a covenant running with the land would create also as the problems of clouds on title in Texas because one would never know whether some previous lessee of particular acreage had made an interstate sale and then seized it and thus if one discovers a completely new reserve on that land, one might subsequently find that gas from that reserve had been dedicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.455" offset="3565785">Well, as we pointed out in our reply brief, which our colleague from Texas apparently did not refer to last time, that is not an accurate representation of the position the Commission is taking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.924" offset="3623672">The Commission’s position here is that this gas is dedicated until the reserve is exhausted, that in the words of the Hunt case, the duty to continue to deliver and sell flows with the gas from the moment of the first delivery down to the exhaustion of the reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.562" offset="3698173">That is the covenant that the Court was talking about in the Hunt case and that is the covenant that we are talking about here,As further support for this notion of dedication of a particular reserve or a particular field, I would call the Court’s attention to the United Gas pipeline case 385 US 83—</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.605" offset="5082349">Well, in response to respondent’s argument about how one cannot supposedly encumber a property interest that one does not own, we do not see any such radical innovation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.203" offset="5136789">We point in our brief to the Interstate Commerce Act cases which support the proposition that once a lessee operates a railroad property, there can be no abandonment, either by the lessee, unless the Commission grants authority either to the lessee or the lessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.736" offset="5198856">But more basically, we would look at the basic purpose of Public Utility Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.318" offset="5221216">The purpose of Public Utility Regulation is based on the public’s interest in the service or the property being regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.139" offset="5256534">The purpose is to regulate for the public benefit, a business or a property that has become affected with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.320" offset="5285269">And in the Natural Gas Act, Section 1(a), Congress expressly finds that the business of transporting and selling natural gas for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with a public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.497" offset="5329990">Now that is the business that the lessee here has started under the authority of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.785" offset="5351097">The theory of Public Interest Regulation has never been based on any notion of estoppel or consent and thus respondents here, do not complain and cannot complain about the fact that when they granted their lease in 1925, they had no way of knowing that the, that the Natural Gas Act would come along, Natural Gas Act would come along later or that the Phillips decision would come along later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.770" offset="5439078">They realized that they are subjected, that the sales Gulf made at least were subjected to the Commission of Jurisdiction even though they never consented to that when they made the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.149" offset="5488501">And thus, since the Purpose of Public Utility Regulation is based on the public’s interest in what is being regulated and not on any notion of estoppel or waiver or consent by the owner, it should not matter that it is the lessor rather than the lessee who by virtue of Property Law has come into control of the property being regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.464" offset="5573765">Let me try a hypothetical case which may illustrate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.405" offset="5593618">Suppose an owner of a large track land leases it for 25 or 50 years to a developer, this is undeveloped real estate, the land is leased to a developer and the lessee proceeds to build residential housing, say garden apartments on the land, now at the time of the lease, the land is not zoned at all, it is undeveloped and un-zoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.368" offset="5697376">But as a result of the lessee’s construction of the residential housing, the local government authorities steps in and zones the land residential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.308" offset="5733216">Suppose even further that the lessee appears at the zoning hearing and then supports the residential zoning, now at the expiration of that lease, 25 or 50 years later, when the lessor comes into the reversion, if the lessor wants to build a factory on that land, the lessor may find that he cannot do so because the land is zoned residential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.659" offset="5814614">And that zoning has resulted from actions taken by the lessee under the lease.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.237" offset="7056893">I will check that on the rebuttal Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.581" offset="7078314">As I have said before, that is more than 1% of El Paso’s total annual requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.232" offset="7108929">The significance of this case is further illustrated by the interest of the States of Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana and that to them, it is not a minor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.312" offset="7149158">Further the, the effect of the case would not be limited to fixed term leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.868" offset="7179460">It would in fact very possibly extend to the kind of lease that is quite common and that was involved in the Pennzoil case in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.942" offset="7227734">That was simply a typical life of the reserves lease, cited in our brief at pages 30 to 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.817" offset="7251244">A life of the reserve’s lease providing for royalties to be based on the market value of the gas, the lessor insisted that this meant the intrastate market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.680" offset="7294712">The Court, the State Court upheld that and the lessees apply to the Commission for an exception from the Commission’s sealing price, arguing that they would have to pay that higher rate and they argue that if they could not pay that higher rate, the lease would be terminated for failure to pay the royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.320" offset="7381229">The Commission responded that if the lease is terminated, well the lessors will still have to carry on the service, citing the Commission’s decision in the Southland case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.366" offset="7417383">The Fifth Circuit however, in reversing the Commission in Pennzoil, said that is not the case, the Commission was operating on a wrong legal premise in Southland in assuming that that gas was trapped in the interstate market as the Fifth Circuit put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.997" offset="7491989">Thus it is quite possible that under such leases, that under such leases if the lessor terminates for failure to pay the higher rates, the lessor is then in control and under Texas Property Law as a respondents assert here, there is a separate state which is not subject to the interstate dedication.</text>

            <label>Mr. Randolph W. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="1881.336" offset="7605256">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.079" offset="7616227">We believe that when it is presented in a decision in the Court below, is an attack on one of the fundamental principles of the Natural Gas Act and that it raises a central issue of whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, possesses a jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act to protect the public, the public’s continuity of interstate service, at reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.906" offset="7715597">Now my colleague has already referenced the Congressional intents stated in Section 1(a) of the Act that the business of transporting and selling natural gas for ultimate distribution to the public is affected with the public interest, we believe that Section 7, and specifically Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act embodies the heart of that public protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.916" offset="7811623">The essential meaning of the Abandonment Requirement of Section 7(b) is to protect the public from a loss of gas in interstate service upon which it has come to rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.088" offset="7868256">California agrees with the statement of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in the original Sunray case at 239 Federal 2nd 101 which states, no single factor in the Commission’s duty to protect that public can be more important to the public than the continuity of service furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.706" offset="7950803">The Natural Gas Act does not deal expressly with the Commission’s Jurisdiction over the gas which is a subject of an expired lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.874" offset="7983404">We think that this particular circumstance, makes it entirely proper when deciding the Commission’s Jurisdiction in this particular instance to look at the reason why the Act was passed and the impact on the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.373" offset="8057487">My colleague has already mentioned the immediate impact as a loss of some 25 million cubic feet a day of gas from the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.174" offset="8100642">This is gas that El Paso has partially relied on in building gas facilities; this is gas that the consumers partially relied on in putting gas appliances in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.366" offset="8157380">We also agree with the statement that this decision of the court below can foster reliance upon forms of leasehold arrangements which under the protection of Local Law, will permit lessors to reenter into possession of gas reserves at their discretion, ignoring the public interest and divert supplies from the interstate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.306" offset="8253197">This is a very real threat today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.117" offset="8264377">It is a real threat because of the difference and diversions of gas prices in the interstate and intrastate market, there is a --, obviously the interstate market is regulated and the intrastate market is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.826" offset="8323309">There is also a great shortage of gas in the interstate market and there is not necessary that, that shortage in the intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.404" offset="8357582">It is in the interest of the producers to be able to lead the interstate market at their discretion, in order to make the best profit possible from this gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.217" offset="8420798">The question here is whether the Commission will be for close from exercising any authority over interstate service of gas supplies covered by the leases which terminate because of clauses in these leases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.816" offset="9435185">I think that would be State Law just, it would be State Law, but the point is, that at that time, it was in the reversionary mineral interest owner’s interest for that gas to be sold in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.979" offset="9487848">Today, it is in his interest to have that gas sold in intrastate commerce, but the question is, under the Natural Gas Act, is it in the consumers’ interest and under the theory of Southland, the consumer’s interest which the Natural Gas Act requires a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to look at, could not be looked at, at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.217" offset="9568828">The continuing stream of gas would simply be terminated, because the lease terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.147" offset="9596518">I think the theory of the case is, is that now, the reversionary mineral interest owners, received not the royalty interest but the entire sales price from this gas, that is sold in interstate commerce at a rate set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.335" offset="9681259">But I think that this Court from the Phillips Petroleum Company versus Wisconsin case through the CATCO and Sunray and Lo-Vaca cases, have always recognized that there was a Congressional intent to protect the consuming public’s continuity of natural gas service at reasonable prices and if determined or reached decisions on the Natural Gas Act with that in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2445.103" offset="9860354">To protect the consumer in passing a Natural Gas Act and I think, I think that is a very important point, I think the Southland would probably tell you that without the Natural Gas Act, without regulation, there might be more gas in the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.067" offset="9928273">And so -- there might very well be, but the point is, Congressional intent was to protect the consuming public because as Justice Brennan said in the Sunray case that if the producers and pipelines were left completely free to determine when to enter and when to leave the market and what prices to charge without the Federal Power Commission looking after their interests, there could be economic chaos at the local level.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.790" offset="10119071">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.328" offset="10141223">For a great deal today about many reasons why this Court should hold that Southlands, Waddell Gas has been somehow dedicated to El Paso in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.066" offset="10184168">Well, I have heard precious little about the Natural Gas Act and I agree with the Chief Justice that the basic decision be rendered by the Court is the power of a lessee through the Natural Gas Act to commit two interstate commerce, the gas from Southland royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.935" offset="10259714">As I understand the Commission’s position in this case, it is that it concedes one, that Southland has never dedicated any of its Waddell Ranch Gas to El Paso, and two, that under Universal Common Law, Gulf could not have dedicated the Southland’s gas because Gulf and Southland owned two separate and independent interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.575" offset="10346232">Instead, the Commission claims that the Waddell Ranch Gas was involuntarily dedicated when Gulf made an interstate sale of Gulf’s leasehold gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.893" offset="10391476">According to the Commission, this dedication occurred as a matter of law under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.462" offset="10417807">So we see the case is boiling down to the fundamental issue of as to whether Congress intended for the Natural Gas Act to abrogate established Common Law and empower Private Party such as Gulf Oil Corporation to dedicate gas it never owned , never had any interest in and never intended to dedicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.577" offset="10502235">We submit that there is nothing in the Natural Gas Act or its legislative history to suggest that Congress intended such a radical result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.120" offset="10532433">To the contrary, the plain language of the Act shows that Gulf could not dedicate Southland’s gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.173" offset="10560645">In considering this question of Statutory Construction, the commission would have you focus on 7(b) of the Act, the Abandonment section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.945" offset="10595754">That Section provides that if a Natural Gas Company undertakes dedicated service, it cannot abandon that service without Commission Authorization but the Commission is looking at the wrong Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.456" offset="10641729">The 7(b) merely begs the question because it applies to dedicated gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.945" offset="10663776">Here, the question is whether Southland’s gas has ever been dedicated, more particularly whether Southland’s gas was somehow dedicated when Gulf made an interstate sale of Gulf’s gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.466" offset="11133772">In determining whether Gulf could dedicate Southland’s gas, we submit that the proper Section of the Act to be looked at is section 7(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.286" offset="11169089">That section says that a certificate shall be issued any qualified applicant who is able and willing properly to do Acts and perform the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.554" offset="11210154">The 7(e) makes it clear that in order for a producer to dedicate gas to interstate service, he must be able to perform the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.814" offset="11247247">Gulf was never able or at anytime to perform the service of selling Southland’s gas because Gulf never owned any interest in or had any right or control over the disposition of Southland’s gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.313" offset="11301164">As the court below noted, Gulf in the present case at all times lacked the legal ability to deliver any gas from Southland’s property after the expiration of a limited 50 year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.585" offset="11354245">As to Gulf’s willingness to dedicate Southland’s gas, I want to make sure that the Court realizes that Gulf’s assertion that it attempted no dedication of gas beyond the interest it owned, is undisputed on the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.205" offset="11416730">Likewise, there has been no challenge to Gulf’s assertion, that it did not purport to dedicate the gas to El Paso which it would not own after the expiration of its lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.410" offset="11465631">According to the record, Gulf believed that any such dedication would have been ineffective as a matter of law to buying gas which it had no right to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.496" offset="11505964">I make this point because in the original argument, it appeared there might be a misconception that the record showed that Gulf intended or attempted in its contract with El Paso and in its certificate application could dedicate more gas than it owned under its 50 year fixed term lease, such is not the case.The f</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.676" offset="11602617">act that Gulf applied for and was issued a certificate of unlimited duration does not bear on whether Gulf was able or willing to dedicate Southland’s gas, that simply meant that Gulf was obligated to sell all the Waddell Ranch Gas it owned, it did mean that Southland either sought or was authorized to sell gas it did not own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.229" offset="11692896">Gulf sought a certificate unlimited in time because its contract with El Paso covered not only its limited interest in Waddell Gas but also gas from a number of other sources, where the leases were not for a fixed term but for the life of the reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.802" offset="11763114">As a result, Gulf has delivered and is today delivering very substantial quantities of gas from these other sources to El Paso under this very same contract, in fact, those volumes of gas are substantially in excess of the volumes of gas involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.217" offset="11824867">Nor was Southland’s gas dedicated because the certificate issued to Gulf pursuant to Section 7(e) imposed a service obligation, separate and apart from the sales obligation imposed by its contract with El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.178" offset="11880665">Under 7(e), the service obligation imposed by producer certificate, extends to what the producer is able to do but does not extend to what he is not able to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.805" offset="12107198">Correct Justice White because El Paso, I mean because Gulf's supply of available gas has depleted to the extent that continuance of service is unwarranted, those are the words of section 7(b) and that is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.206" offset="12168743">In this case, Gulf’s service obligation was limited to the Waddell Ranch Gas it found and produced during the defined 50 year term of its lease because that was the only gas Gulf had any right to sell and deliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.353" offset="12225376">Thus Gulf service obligation in no way was binding on Southland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.249" offset="12248991">Let me illustrate by saying that in most instances, gas reserves are owned by a number of different producers and if one owner of the gas reserve makes an interstate sale of his interest, his service obligation binds him to deliver all the gas he owns regardless of any limitation to this contract to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.116" offset="12328403">But this service obligation is no way binding on any of the other owners, they are free to sell their interest in the gas to the purchaser of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.320" offset="12365184">We say that is exactly the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.413" offset="12377618">Gulf made an interstate sale of its interest in the Waddell Ranch Gas, the service obligation it incurred under a certificate, obligated Gulf to deliver as it has done all over Waddell Ranch Gas it owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.686" offset="12434669">Gulf would have had this obligation even if it is contract with El Paso had expired before the termination of its fixed term lease but Gulf’s service obligation is no way binding on Southland’s entirely separate interest in the Waddell Ranch Gas because Gulf was never legally able to undertake any service from Southland’s gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.084" offset="12532263">I would like to now turn to several of the points that Mr. Barnett made during the course of his opening presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.742" offset="12570924">First, I want to turn to is the question of reliance which he mentioned I believe also Mr. Deutsch mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.697" offset="12606764">We reject that claim entirely as the Court below noted, this claim of public reliance is supported and I quote, by neither fact nor authority, none of the commissions orders under review here or based upon any such alleged reliance and moreover, there is absolutely no evidence in the record to support a claim of public reliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.295" offset="13125138">I want to point out that Southland did not ratify Gulf’s interstate dedication of Gulf’s gas to the interstate market by accepting royalties in a opinion, exhaustive opinion more than six years ago by Judge Leventhal of the DC Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.808" offset="13211133">He pointed out that a royalty owner is not a Natural Gas Company subject to Commission Jurisdiction because he is a land owner who simply enters into a lease for the expiration development of his land, if that transact is clearly not a jurisdictional one and that likewise the royalty owner does not make a sale of their gas in the interstate commerce because he has no control over the sale, one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.207" offset="13328789">The Commission also contends that Southland’s gas was somehow dedicated to interstate service in this case because of the continuing flow of Gulf’s gas could not be interrupted without 7(b) Abandonment Authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.100" offset="13384377">First, let me say that the record is unequivocal and clear that Southland has never made a sale of its gas in the interstate commerce except under compulsion of the orders that are under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.805" offset="13427218">So we do not have a situation where Southland’s gas has been flowing in interstate commerce and because of the flow, the Commission can assert a jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.870" offset="13471417">The basic policy though and the Commission’s argument, if that the only physical flow that Gulf could indeed dedicate to interstate service was Gulf’s leasehold gas, a 50 year flow and as this Court made clear in Sunray, once Gulf’s gas commenced the flow, that supply could not be withdrawn from continued interstate movement without Commission permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.023" offset="13563995">Of course, Gulf did not withdraw that supply; instead Gulf has delivered all of its leasehold gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.932" offset="13591685">Therefore, Gulf supplied the only supply which ever has flowed in the interstate commerce is gone and in the words of Section 7(b), it has been depleted to the extent that continuance of service is unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.548" offset="13646124">As to the basis for asserting jurisdiction because of what are essentially policy witnesses, I believe that Mr. Justice Rehnquist put his finger on the question about this proliferation of short term leases if Southland prevails in this case, when he said that clearly, the Commission has the power and can require all of the necessary information so to determine whether or not a proposed sale involved such a lease and if so to take appropriate action to protect the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.152" offset="14180589">This certificate yes, in this certificate, the service obligation that was imposed by this certificate as I spoke to a minute ago, Gulf’s service obligation is limited to Gulf’s ability to perform and Gulf’s ability to perform here was limited to its leasehold gas and under its lease, the only gas that Gulf was entitled to was the gas it actually produced during the specified 50 year term, so that the fact that Gulf got an unlimited term certificate really made no difference, it did not affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.362" offset="14337429">In other words Southland as far as we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.237" offset="14372851">As a second policy reason, the commission speculates that dedicated reserves may somehow be released from interstate commerce because of the reasoning or the theory of the Fifth Circuit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.488" offset="14425932">They say that such theory may be applied where a lease or grants are produces the right to dedicate gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.374" offset="14453412">He dedicates the gas and then his lease is prematurely terminated before all of a dedicated gas has been produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.633" offset="14482461">They particularly refer to the typical life of reserve lease which provides and it will remain in effect, so long as reserves are found in paying quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.152" offset="14520599">We do not believe that the reasoning of Fifth Circuit applies to such a situation and his opinion Judge Clark was very careful to emphasize that under its lease, Gulf at no time was possessed of rights in the Waddell Ranch Gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.956" offset="14575770">That could extend beyond a 50 year term of this lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.487" offset="14589876">Therefore, it is clear we believe that the decision below is based upon the fact that Gulf never, and I emphasize the word never, had any interest in or control over Southland’s gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.870" offset="14635434">In fact, that is the basis on which the Tenth Circuit subsequently distinguished this case when it affirmed orders of the Commission holding that gas of Phillips Petroleum Company was dedicated to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.870" offset="14691440">The Commission, in fact in the Pennzoil case mentioned by the Commission Counsel is going even further and taken the position that the reasoning in this case actually supports the position, that when a life of reserve lease preventively terminates the interstate dedication of reserves prior to such termination continues in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.327" offset="14777226">In any event, when this Court is faced with a case involving the premature termination of a typical life reserve’s lease, it may well conclude that because the producer under such a lease had the power to dedicate 100 percent of his gas reserves and did so dedicate them before his lease terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.584" offset="14866252">Any such gas remains dedicated despite the lease termination.Such a holding would be entirely consistent with holding for Southland based on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.759" offset="14910973">All that the Court need hold here and all that we believe that this Circuit held is that one who has never had any interest in or control over gas cannot dedicate that gas to interstate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.960" offset="14963845">Of course, if there is any question in the Court’s mind as to the extent of the decision below, it can and should limit it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3894.920" offset="15659643">I believe that this morning or this afternoon, the Government said that they are not relying on any type of agency concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.505" offset="15689945">I do want to mention two other points that Mr. Barnett brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.579" offset="15710320">First, he read from a part of the brief we filed with the Commission as to once gas are being dedicated, it remains dedicated but he quit there because the next sentence says, but this legal conclusion begs the question of whether gas attributable to the interest of the mineral estate or mineral interest owners has been dedicated to interstate commerce, and then we went on to answer another question that was asked this morning and that is the effect of this Court’s decision in California versus Lo-Vaca.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.681" offset="15842709">We said that the reliance on that decision is totally misplaced because there has been no physical movement of any gas attributable to our mineral estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.966" offset="15887848">The question was asked of Mr. Barnett, could Southland have come in and blocked tin effect Gulf's certificate application, of course Southland had no idea that it would ever be claimed that Gulf was attempting to dedicate Southland’s gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.215" offset="15964857">But in any event, in this case, the record shows that the Commission told the Fifth Circuit and I quote that Southland Royalty could not prevent Gulf’s total dedication of surplus residue gas to El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.640" offset="16058480">As to the Commission’s analogy to an ancient covenant running with the land, we find that unusual, that analogy does not benefit them under Common Law, a covenant is not binding on anyone who is not a successor to the covenanter and in this case the decision of the Texas Supreme Court in 1973, made it crystal clear that Southland had a separate independent State that was vested at all times and that Southland is in no way a successor to Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.441" offset="16245726">In conclusion, let me say that we think that this case is based on two basic principles still and that is one, that you cannot dedicate what you do not own and two, that Gulf Oil never owned any interest in Southland’s gas, never had any right in that gas, had never had any control over it and that therefore, Southland’s gas was not dedicated to intestate service when Gulf made an interstate service of Gulf’s gas, for these reasons, we ask that you affirm the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="4089.236" offset="16436942">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.283" offset="16453034">The state of Texas for reasons that we have outlined in our Amicus brief, joined in the most of the basic arguments that has been presented by Southland, I would not want us to be in agreement here, not that it is material to the decision in this case, we would not want to be in agreement that Congress could authorize a lessee to contract the gas that he did not own, nor would we want to be in agreement concerning any Congressional Authority to control intrastate gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.969" offset="16591796">But since neither one of those matters are in our opinion essential to the issue here let me turn to Section 7(b) which is the heart of this case and state why the State of Texas cares about this case and what our interest is that we conceive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.457" offset="16673821">And sustaining the Circuit Court’s decision and overturning the Federal Power Commission Order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.339" offset="16709347">Section 7(b) as we have been over and over, speaks of no Natural Gas Company shall abandon all or any portion of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.212" offset="16760756">Now, we say first that the Congressional intent as well as the clear reading of Section 7(b) would require you to hold in this case that Southland Royalty is not a natural gas company with then the meaning of 7(b) that Gulf is the only natural gas company that would come within that definition or meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.775" offset="16863052">Then when it says facilities, we ask that you hold that, facilities contemplated in this case are only the lease that Gulf took, its lease, that that is the facilities, the 50 year term lease or that that would be the facilities in any interpretation of 7(b) would be the lease taken by the lessee and that the service intended is the gas covered by that lease and not any other gas, not any reversionary interest of anyone else and then it is a misreading of the Federal Power Commission Act to say that the mere dedication of a lessee’s interest to interstate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.755" offset="17070986">In some way, not ever stated by Congress would then mean that as long as that gas were flowing it would also authorize the bringing in under that service or that facility, gas which the lessee did not even own in the first place or would extend the gas that was found after that particular lease were abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.218" offset="17176834">We say that is a total misreading and a stretching of the Federal Power Commission Authority and that the Congress intends that it should say so and then and only then would we be facing the issue that is being inquired about in some of the questions then we would certainly want to raise Constitutional objections to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.031" offset="17260113">But that is not here, that it is not intended and the reason that we are concerned with any rule that would emanate from this case, if brought at the Federal Power Commission Order and let me refer to it again, it said, the duty to continue to serve is like an ancient covenant running with the land.</text>

            <text syncTime="4342.517" offset="17449971">And that has to bother us because we own 16 million acres of land in our state, the State of Texas does, we are far and away are the largest land owner.</text>
