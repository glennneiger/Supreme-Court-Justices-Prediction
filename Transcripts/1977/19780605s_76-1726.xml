            <text syncTime="14.426" offset="137675">This is a wrongful death case arising out of a fatal accident on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.694" offset="158678">The question is whether damages may be recovered for loss of society as well as pecuniary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.010" offset="183964">Congress has enacted a statute which only authorizes the recovery of pecuniary damages when the death occurs more than three miles from shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.652" offset="218550">Inside the three-mile limit, where the statue does not apply, this Court has held, the damages for loss of society can also be recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.909" offset="251569">In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, held at the same rule should be applied on a high seas because we are persuaded that the courts must apply the standard selected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.451" offset="297754">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
