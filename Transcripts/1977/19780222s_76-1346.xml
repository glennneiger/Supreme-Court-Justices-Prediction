            <text syncTime="19.559" offset="158141">In number 76-1346 Lorillard is here from the Fourth Circuit, Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.403" offset="193563">In this case, the question is whether there is a right to jury trial in private civil actions for lost wages under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.174" offset="244659">Respondent brought this suit against petitioner former employer alleging that she had been discharged because of her age in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.152" offset="280499">She demanded a jury trial on a claim, but the trial court ruled that she had no right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.659" offset="306517">On appeal that Court of Appeals held that the respondent had both the statutory and the constitutional right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.473" offset="337864">We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict in the circuits on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.942" offset="359702">By an opinion filed today with the clerk, we hold that the respondent did have a statutory right to a jury trial on the claim for lost wages and we therefore do not reach the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.222" offset="412783">Although there is no provision in the Act to express the relating to jury trials, the structure of the Act demonstrates the congressional intent to grant a right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.878" offset="455415">First Congress incorporated the procedures of the Fair Labor Standards Act under which jury trials have been afforded as a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.582" offset="490210">Moreover, by expressly providing for legal relief in the Age Discrimination Act, we believe that Congress evidenced its intention that jury trial be made available on demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.778" offset="539007">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.061" offset="552172">Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration or discussion of this case.</text>
