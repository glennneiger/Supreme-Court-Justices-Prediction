            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79979">We will hear arguments first this morning in Michigan v. Tyler and Tompkins.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Butler</label>
            <text syncTime="24.054" offset="176110">This Arson case presents the questions of when and to what extend of warrant is to be required for post fire and by analogy other post disaster investigations and of which evidence is admissible against in particular arsonists who burn their own buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.571" offset="242252">The case arises as out of facts which were the most part are typical of any arson for profit case with two small exceptions which we plan to elaborate upon later in argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.249" offset="288959">In relating the facts and in attempting to justify, a warrant was post fire searches in general as well as the searches which occurred in particular in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.014" offset="327933">We have four principle themes.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.175" offset="336606">The first is that the public interest in a post disaster or post fire search is significantly greater than the public interest in any inspection of the type touched upon and dealt with in Camara, say and Secretary of State against Barlow.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.085" offset="400240">The second theme is that the privacy interests at issue as well as the potential for abuse are very minimal, primarily because of the extensive damage that has taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.411" offset="441618">The extent of the already lawful intrusion and because of the nature of the search for the cause or the origin of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.713" offset="470771">Third, we contend that a warrant in circumstances like these whether administrative or criminal will provide no protection in the great majority of cases, very little protection in a very limited class of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.221" offset="528763">Our fourth theme is that, a fire investigation, there are certain costs, in fire investigation and in public safety to require any kind of administrative search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.322" offset="577246">The general interest in a search, in conducting a search of this type are several.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.705" offset="594696">The cause itself must be determined first as some type of exigent circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.095" offset="620296">This is a theme which the Michigan Supreme Court seem not to acknowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.922" offset="639626">Now we grant that, it did say if there are exigent circumstances, the possibility of danger, of evidence burning, of danger to the fireman conducting the investigation, danger of water damage to the evidence that then they will excuse us a search that takes place at that time, but we think they should have concluded that until the clause is determined there should be a presumption if there is an exigent circumstance.</text>
