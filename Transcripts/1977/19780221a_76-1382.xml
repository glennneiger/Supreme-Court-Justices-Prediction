            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79984">We will hear first this morning 76-1382, United States against Scott.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="10.009" offset="120004">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.938" offset="131706">This case is here on writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit dismissing the government’s appeal in this case which was taken from an order of the district court which dismissed count one of the indictment against respondent on grounds of prejudicial pre-indictment delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.497" offset="209969">The relevant facts are simple and may be summarized briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.706" offset="226792">In March 1975, respondent was charged in a three-count indictment with distributing controlled substances on three separate occasions; cocaine on September 20, 1974, codeine on September 24, 1974, and heroin on January 22, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.478" offset="305891">He moved before trial to dismiss the first two counts on due process grounds, alleging prejudicial pre-indictment delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.424" offset="337656">The motion was denied with the proviso that it could be renewed after presentation of evidence at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.413" offset="361584">It was renewed and again denied at the close of the prosecution’s case, at which time, a motion for a judgment of acquittal was also denied, the court indicating that the prosecution had put on enough evidence to take the question of respondent’s guilt or innocence to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.860" offset="435354">The pre-indictment delay motion was again renewed after the defense had rested and this time it was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.066" offset="468164">The United States then sought an appeal and we are concerned here solely with the dismissal of count one.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.053" offset="496167">The court granted respondent’s motion to dismiss that count on the basis of delay, finding that there had been intentional delay by the government in bringing the charge for the improper purpose of accumulating evidence of other crimes by the respondent, and that the delay of five-and-half months had prejudiced the respondent because it had interfered with his ability to recollect the events of the date on which the offense allegedly occurred.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="131.560" offset="606195">Mr. Frey, count two is entirely out of the case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="134.258" stopTime="260.414">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="134.258" offset="616957">Yes, we are not asking this Court to reverse the dismissal of our appeal as to count two.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.471" offset="661783">In light of this Court’s subsequent decision in United States against Lovasco, the dismissal was indisputably erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.404" offset="697519">The question this Court must decide is whether the United States is entitled to correction of the error by an appeal and, of course, whether the United States can appeal depends on whether the double jeopardy clause would bar a second trial of respondent if the appeal were successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.315" offset="765228">Now, let me approach this question, first, by describing some of the legal terrain that this Court has traversed in the last several years and by positioning the present case on the double jeopardy landscape.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.450" offset="813711">The issue in the present case is akin to those recently decided by the Court in cases such as Wilson, Jenkins, Dinitz, Martin Linen, Lee and Finch, and which it has now before in Sanabria.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.498" offset="865956">As a result of these decisions, the court has authoritatively answered many questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.676" offset="890616">For instance, Wilson made clear that the government could appeal a dismissal or an acquittal that followed a jury verdict of guilty when success on appeal would not require a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.645" offset="950488">On the other hand, Jenkins, Martin Linen and Finch established that in most, if not all, other circumstances the Double Jeopardy Clause confers upon defendants in criminal cases an interest in retaining the benefits of a post-jeopardy acquittal by either judge or jury whether or not the acquittal is legally or factually correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.778" offset="1031050">This interest precludes a government appeal to review the propriety of such acquittals.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.472" offset="1053829">Dinitz and Lee, on the other hand, established that a mid-trial termination not amounting to an acquittal on the merits if requested by the defendant does not bar a second trial, at least as long as the termination is of a kind that allows or contemplates the possibility of further prosecution.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="260.414" offset="1121538">Mr. Frey, you are not suggesting that all of the authoritative answers, as you refer to them, that had been given by this Court to these questions are consistent with one another, are you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="270.371" stopTime="349.170">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="270.371" offset="1161453">No, I am not, but they have at least established a group of cubbyholes in which certain situations can be placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.975" offset="1191860">We know what the rules are unless this Court is prepared to reexamine any of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.660" offset="1218609">I think there is some inconsistency in rationales, but nevertheless, some clear strains of decision or lines of policy that I will attempt to elucidate that shed considerable light on the proper outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.589" offset="1298335">This case falls in, and as yet unexplored, middle ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.740" offset="1314844">On the one hand, it plainly does not involve an acquittal under any acceptable definition of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.938" offset="1339713">Unlike Jenkins, unlike Martin Linen, unlike Finch, there was here no determination that respondent did not commit the offense that he was charged with nor was there a resolution in respondent’s favor of any facts relating to the question of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.633" offset="1410453">There may be cases such as Sanabria in which it is difficult to tell whether there has been an acquittal, but this is not such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.574" offset="1438247">Instead, there was here simply a determination that regardless of respondent’s guilt or innocence, wholly independent factors preclude his conviction.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="367.212" stopTime="556.161">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="367.212" offset="1548797">It was a dismissal of the indictment which would be the proper remedy if the legal grounds were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.066" offset="1584219">Thus, the case is holding that an acquittal may not be reviewed on appeal where a second trial would result from a reversal are not controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.547" offset="1618074">On the other hand, this case is not necessarily controlled by the mistrial dismissal cases such as Dinitz and Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.953" offset="1643778">Those cases can be distinguished from this case on the ground that their determination of the first trial did not result from a ruling that, if correct, would bar further prosecution of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.393" offset="1693515">Unlike what the Court was able to say in Lee, the Court could not say here that the ruling of the district court was the functional equivalent of a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.191" offset="1732699">Nevertheless, we submit that the instant case is markedly closer in almost all material respects for the mistrial dismissal line of cases than to the acquittal line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.086" offset="1776271">Accordingly, the government’s appeal in the ensuing retrial if the appeal succeeds are not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.424" offset="1809604">I would like to turn to a consideration of the relevant double jeopardy policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.794" offset="1827158">In an attempt to demonstrate why those policies are served rather than offended by allowing the government’s appeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.990" offset="1859863">The history of the Court’s double jeopardy jurisprudence reflects a continuing effort to strike an appropriate balance between competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.857" offset="1891315">On the one hand, the interest of society in conducting fair trials ending in just judgments which subsumes the societal interest of the guilty should be punished for their crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.757" offset="1934991">On the other hand, the interest of the individual to be sheltered from the anxiety and expense of multiple trials, to avoid multiple punishments for a single offense and to preserve a determination at trial that he is not guilty of the offense charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.622" offset="1994446">None of these interests is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.315" offset="2005208">Thus, society’s interest in legally just and factually accurate trial outcomes is required to yield to the double jeopardy interest of an acquitted defendant even though the acquittal may, for instance, be the product of a palpably erroneous jury instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.086" offset="2064245">On the other hand, whatever interest the defendant has in preserving an acquittal must yield in situations like Wilson or like Serfass where he is not yet been placed in jeopardy when the acquittal occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.300" offset="2113146">As for the central double jeopardy interest of the defendant in avoiding multiple trials, it is well settled that that interest too must give way in at least three types of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.899" offset="2159540">The first is where the defendant has been convicted and the conviction is reversed or set aside subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.890" offset="2183468">The second is where, as a result of prosecutorial or judicial error, the defendant elects to move for a mistrial that terminates the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.487" offset="2221920">The third is where the trial is terminated even over the defendant’s objection because circumstances make such determination manifestly necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.957" offset="2263716">In all of the cases involving the permissibility of a second trial or of a government appeal, the interest of the defendant that could allow him to prevail has fit within two categories.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.185" offset="2376670">Yes, it is a balancing process and the point I was attempting to suggest is that the interest in avoiding multiple trials is not absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.921" offset="2407599">It requires a balance of the societal interest in public justice against the individual interest in avoiding repetitious litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.330" offset="2441244">The manifest necessity determination is an effort to strike that balance in a situation where the trial has had to terminate because of a hung jury or acts of wars and weighed against other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.668" offset="2498609">It is justifiable to override the defendant’s right in avoiding multiple trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.275" offset="2525045">I gather you have decided a case this morning that involves that very question.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.335" offset="2553257">In any event, if I could come back to the concept that there are two kinds of interests of the defendant which I think can be shown that neither of which is implicated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.849" offset="2611354">The first interest which was deemed controlling in Ball and Kepner, Jenkins, Martin Linen, Finch is the interest in preserving an acquittal if the defendant is able to obtain one.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.975" offset="2655866">Now, as I have indicated, that interest is not at all involved in this case since respondent most definitely was not exonerated of the charge of cocaine distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.386" offset="2697453">The second interest, which is central to the mistrial dismissal line of cases and which prevailed in such cases as Downum and Jorn, is the valued right of the defendant to obtain a verdict at the first trial if he wants one.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.723" offset="2754818">Cases implicating this interest both to such factors as whether the defendant has agreed to determination of the first trial and if he has resisted it to whether determination was nevertheless necessary to serve the ends of public justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.037" offset="2812079">If, as in Dinitz and Lee, he has sought the pre-verdict determination, it is difficult to conclude that a second trial should be barred on the grounds of an unjustified deprivation of the defendant’s right to obtain a verdict at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.273" offset="2869026">Now, respondent Scott, like Dinitz and Lee, did not have his right to settle his dispute with society once and for all at the first trial taken away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.243" offset="2908941">He could have had a verdict, but he preferred instead determination on a ground unrelated to his guilt or innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.311" offset="3821137">As to the interest in avoiding multiple trials, that is always an interest of a defendant and that is an interest in the mistrial situation, that is an interest in the Lee dismissal situation, that is an interest in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.741" offset="3870874">What I am suggesting is that it is not an interest of sufficient force to override the public interest in having one determination of the defendant’s guilt or innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.718" offset="4074838">I refer to the following statement which appears at page 30 of 432 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.714" offset="4094795">“Where a midtrial dismissal is granted on the ground, correct or not, that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged, Jenkins establishes that further prosecution is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.772" offset="4147040">This was such a dismissal, but we believe that the statement in Lee which was not necessary to the Court’s decision there was never intended to govern cases such as the present one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.671" offset="4906577">All dismissals that do not determine guilt or innocence ought to be analyzed in the same way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.638" offset="7014449">I would like to confine my discussion with the Court this morning to rebutting the brief submitted by the government in this case and as far as our positive position in this case, I would like to rely on my brief in this matter and I do not intend to reiterate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.161" offset="7100549">I think it is neat for the Court in launching a discussion in the consideration of this case to first consider what we do know about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.553" offset="7158123">There is a parent agreement between both the government and the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.630" offset="7190410">Now, it is clear that this case does not fall within the ambit of the Serfass decision which is part and parcel of the trilogy which this Court recently has decided that Wilson-Jenkins-Serfass trilogy, as the Court has referred to them in the Lee decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.592" offset="7274315">It is clear we do not have Serfass here because we have jeopardy attaching and I read the Serfass decision as making that determination the critical factor and the reason for the decision in Serfass to permit a retrial of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.998" offset="7363968">In this case, the defendant, Mr. Scott, was put to trial both with regard to the government’s proofs and to the defendant’s proofs and as to count three, which of course is not before the Court, it was sent to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.073" offset="7444216">So the jeopardy has attached under the Downum decision once that jury was empaneled, once they began to consider the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.520" offset="7482041">I think it is also clear that we do not have the situation that we had in Lee or the situation that the Court was concerned about in the Sisson decision where counsel merely sat back and waited until he knew jeopardy had attached and then attempted to use the Double Jeopardy clause as a sword, not as a shield, but as a sword, deliberately deferred his decision to file a motion on legal grounds until after jeopardy had attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.976" offset="7675870">I think the court was quite concerned about running into that situation and certainly in the Lee case, they came very close to that situation. Counsel in that case had deferred his motion until the very morning of trial and a motion that would require research and he very well knew that and that was noted by the trial judge in his opinion because he said “gentlemen, I am going to need time to consider this motion” and they then proceeded with the proofs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.427" offset="12113656">But certainly in this case, as was stated in the Wilson decision by Justice Douglas in his dissent, certainly in that case the Court in arriving at the conclusion that it did had to consider all of the facts in the case, facts which bore the elements of the offense as well as on the motion in that case which was the same as in this case, for pre-indictment delay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.986" offset="13419883">Well, I would think that the government should have some prior notice of the defendant having to present this motion or is going to present it at the conclusion of the case because they certainly want to bring these factors out in the testimony of their witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.832" offset="13483308">I urge the Court not to fashion a new rule of procedure for proceeding in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.348" offset="13501280">The government indicated we can call it an arrest of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.580" offset="13514237">I felt that in Justice Harlan’s decision in Sisson, that he clearly indicated that if you are going to get involved in deciding something that requires a decision on the facts that goes beyond the face of the indictment, that that is clearly not an arrest of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.095" offset="13572333">So I cannot buy the government’s argument in this case that we could make a motion for arrest of judgment because that decision of the judge would make that the conclusion of that case would necessarily be based upon the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.575" offset="13614234">I submit to the Court in conclusion that if this Court fashions this new form of procedure for proceeding in trial courts on pretrial motions and motions at trial, you are going to create chaos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.173" offset="13660627">You are going to have judges that were put in the position that the judge was in the Lee case for somebody running in on the day of trial and saying “here is my motion, decided it now.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.432" offset="13813705">The respondent misconstrues our argument on the timing of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.642" offset="13826453">Of course the motion should be made in the first in instance in advance of trial, but as we argued in Lovasco, this kind of motion is best determined only after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.832" offset="13867308">Our objection as to its determination in the middle of trial when our appeal rights are defeated contrary, by the way to the policies of Rule 12 (e) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.395" offset="13909522">In other words, the motion should be made before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.863" offset="13919344">Now, respondent wants you, of course, to look at this case from the perspective of where we stand now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.330" offset="13941287">He is going to have to be subjected to the second trial, but if you decide this case in the government’s favor, look at it from the proper perspective which is at the time, at the point in trial when the respondent could have a ruling on his motion and the judge says “I am ready to rule on your motion now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.802" offset="14011191">Now, respondent has a choice in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.045" offset="14024147">He can accept the ruling then and there terminating the trial if it is in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.714" offset="14042746">He simply does so at the risk that if he has introduced error into the trial, the government can get it corrected and there will be a second trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3723.027" offset="14972079">The second respect in which it is significant is if you have a manifest necessity case like the issue in Crest against Klein (Ph) that never got abandoned by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.418" offset="15013561">You may have had an unjustifiable mistrial declared by the court and if that was done before the attachment of jeopardy, there is no Double Jeopardy barred or a retrial there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3928.802" offset="15795145">The government appealed claiming that that was legally erroneous and that we said every fact necessary to support a conviction was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.755" offset="15834955">Now, this Court said in effect, well, let us suppose that the district court had not, let us suppose the government was right that if the district court had simply rested on Ehlert, we could review that and reverse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.274" offset="15888977">Let us suppose that, although subsequently I think it was held that that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.760" offset="15906949">Then it said “we still cannot tell whether the judge found all the facts that were necessary to support a conviction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.680" offset="15942684">We are not sure whether he found that there was knowing refusal to submit to induction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3979.671" offset="15998586">Yes, but the fact that in Jenkins the Court may have said whether or not this was an acquittal, the fact that further proceedings are necessary bars an appeal does not answer the question about Lee because, in Lee and in the mistrial cases, it is also true that you do not have an acquittal, but you still have to make the inquiry into whether an appeal on the second trial was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.736" offset="16090851">Now, I am suggesting that we have in this case, a category of ruling which when you look at the policies and what we are trying to protect is more likely than it is like Jenkins and the reason that is so is because in Jenkins, it is plain that the district court found the defendant had not committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.348" offset="16173293">The District Court and The Supreme Court was saying, well, “suppose he found out an illegally erroneous basis, suppose we could agree with the government,” and so on, but there was a finding that there was no crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.143" offset="16220523">Now, here there was no finding that there was no crime and we submit that that is and should be properly critical to the Double Jeopardy inquiry.</text>
