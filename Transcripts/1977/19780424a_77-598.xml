            <label>Mr. John R. Reese</label>
            <text syncTime="23.116" offset="172366">Mr. Chief Justice and May I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.493" offset="181875">I am John Reese, counsel for the petitioners, the Greyhound Corp and Greyhound Lines, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.216" offset="208833">This is a private anti-trust case brought by the respondent, Mt. Hood Stages against Greyhound.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.082" offset="232239">The issue as to which the Court granted certiorari is whether the four-year statute of limitations in anti-trust cases was tolled by an Interstate Commerce Commission proceeding brought by Mt. Hood in which the government later intervened, with the result the damage period in this case was multiplied five-fold to 20 years instead of the normal four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.977" offset="323876">The Court of Appeals held that the statute was tolled, upheld the $13 million-treble damage judgment against Greyhound.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.206" offset="356790">Without tolling, the judgment would still be approximately $8 million.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="75.452" offset="381764">Give me that last figure again.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_r_reese" startTime="77.225" stopTime="220.356">
            <label>Mr. John R. Reese</label>
            <text syncTime="77.225" offset="388869">Approximately $8 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.919" offset="411648">The jury found that Mt. Hood knew or should have known of its claims in this case on a specific date in December 14, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.173" offset="444666">Therefore, in order to recover damages for any period prior to that date, Mt. Hood was required to file its complaint within four years by December 14, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.115" offset="492418">Mt. Hood did not file its complaint within that four-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.808" offset="507151">Instead, it waited an additional 3.5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.014" offset="523974">The complaint in this case was not filed until July 5, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.170" offset="544663">On the face of it then, the statute of limitations barred recovery for all damages prior to July 5, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.023" offset="584056">The Court of Appeals, however, allowed recovery all the way back to 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.137" offset="604536">It did that on the theory that the statute was tolled by two different methods which can then be added together.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.067" offset="628255">First, it sustained the jury's finding that there was fraudulent concealment until December 14, 1960. Then, it held that the claims were saved from being barred on December 14, 1964 because, on that very day, the government filed a petition asking leave to intervene in an interstate commerce commission proceeding that Mt. Hood had brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.475" offset="721878">The Court held that the filing of that petition on that very last day before the claims were barred satisfied the requirements for tolling under Section 16(i) of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.418" offset="765659">Section 16(i) is obviously at the heart of the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.331" offset="785303">It is a carefully drawn statute and it provides that whenever the United States institutes a proceeding to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of the anti-trust laws then the statute of limitations is tolled as to any matter complained of in a prior government proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.942" offset="863670">Now, it is important to remember that while Section 16(i) is a tolling provision, it is and is part of a statute of repose that is designed to cut off stale claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.183" offset="908706">The panel of the Ninth Circuit that decided this case failed to recognize that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.211" offset="928768">As a result, its application of the statute does violence to the language and frustrates its purpose as a statute of repose.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.640" offset="986550">The purpose of the government's intervention in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, was to assure that the Interstate Commerce Commission took into account competitive policies as it is required to do under Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.767" offset="1075053">Would there be any consequences that would either punish violations or restrain violations or prevent violations?</text>

            <text syncTime="273.705" offset="1174737">Is it to help the Commission understand the case a little better?</text>

            <label>Mr. John R. Reese</label>
            <text syncTime="281.611" offset="1206397">Well, that is pretty accurate, I think, Mr. Chief Justice. One of the duties of the Anti-Trust Division of the Justice Department is to participate before administrative agencies that are required to take into consideration competitive policies in their regulatory decision making.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="298.295" stopTime="304.965">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="298.295" offset="1273166">Do you say an intervention by the United States could never toll the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_r_reese" startTime="304.965" stopTime="342.398">
            <label>Mr. John R. Reese</label>
            <text syncTime="304.965" offset="1299811">Mr. Chief Justice, we do not want to take such an extreme position as to say it could never toll the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.580" offset="1322276">We do maintain that it could never toll the statute in a Section 5 proceeding under the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.554" offset="1350175">That is a Section under which the ICC not only does not enforce the anti-trust laws, but indeed, it authorizes and immunizes conduct that would otherwise violate the anti-trust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.138" offset="1408480">I cannot see how a proceeding under that Section can fairly be read to be one to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of the anti-trust laws within the meaning of Section 16(i).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="342.398" stopTime="358.800">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="342.398" offset="1449545">Of course, the Department of Justice Anti-Trust Division itself does not punish or restrain, does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="351.433" offset="1485698">It can only persuade a court to do so is it not the essence of it or other tribunal?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_r_reese" startTime="358.800" stopTime="469.893">
            <label>Mr. John R. Reese</label>
            <text syncTime="358.800" offset="1515164">That is absolutely correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.135" offset="1528435">What I am saying is that it cannot even persuade the ICC to do so under Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act because that is not the function of the ICC under that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.767" offset="1566991">Indeed, as I understand McLean Trucking, the ICC is without power to do that under Section 5 and it certainly is not the purpose of Section 5 to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of the anti-trust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.124" offset="1640448">The Court of Appeals' decision finding that the statute was tolled by reason of Section 16(i) is both bad statutory interpretation and bad policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.522" offset="1686005">It is bad statutory interpretation because the terms and requirements of Section 16(i) are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.048" offset="1708157">The government's petition for leave to intervene does not satisfy those terms and requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.578" offset="1730309">That petition is simply not an anti-trust complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.663" offset="1742639">It is not the kind of document that should be required to bring Section 16(i) to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.934" offset="1767716">The government's petition actually goes out of its way to remain neutral and non-committal and to avoid making any charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.236" offset="1800839">In fact, that petition specifically denied knowledge of the facts and it did not ask for any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.033" offset="1828111">The petition said "we have no way of knowing whether those of Mt. Hood's charges which Greyhound denies are true or false."</text>
            <text syncTime="446.562" offset="1866146">In other words, that petition could hardly have been more innocuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.424" offset="1881610">It does not begin to satisfy the language or the purpose of Section 16(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="455.666" offset="1902613">To put its deficiencies in terms of the statutory language, the petition did not institute a civil or criminal proceeding as Section 16(i) requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.154" offset="1940542">The Court of Appeals apparently admits that this proceeding was not instituted by the government.</text>

            <label>Mr. John R. Reese</label>
            <text syncTime="539.725" offset="2238861">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.830" offset="2255266">The second deficiency of the petition in terms of the statutory language of Section 16(i) is that the petition did not complain of anything, as the statute clearly requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.395" offset="2309496">The Court of Appeals does not discuss this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.515" offset="2322035">Third, the government's petition did not seek to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of any of the anti-trust laws as Section 16(i) requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.800" offset="2363099">On this point, the best the Court of Appeals can say for us is that the petition showed that the government's interest lay in the possibility of anti-trust violations should Mt. Hood's allegations prove correct, purely hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.164" offset="2424644">It is plainly insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Section 16(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="593.888" offset="2455468">Now, it is important to remember also what kind of proceeding it was, touched on this and answer to the Chief Justice's question a moment ago, but it was an ICC proceeding brought by Mt. Hood under Section 5 to reopen some old acquisition cases for the purpose of obtaining a supplemental order in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.158" offset="2532581">It was not an anti-trust proceeding when Mr. Hood brought it.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.540" offset="2546061">No one has suggested that it would have satisfied the requirements of Section 16(i) at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.030" offset="2572079">The government's petition for leave to intervene only as interested party without requesting relief and without making any charges could not have changed the fundamental regulatory nature of that proceeding into an anti-trust case that satisfies the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.384" offset="2633519">Indeed, the Justice Department itself specifically distinguishes that kind of activity from its normal anti-trust enforcement activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.214" offset="2680853">I have been focusing on the petition for leave to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.160" offset="2692555">There are three basic reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.489" offset="2701855">First, even Mt. Hood agrees that Section 16(i) applies only to the extent that the private case is based upon a matter complained of in the prior government proceeding and this court, in Leh against General Petroleum, said that in general what the government complained of must be determined from the face of its complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.576" offset="2786283">Here, although the petition for leave to intervene did not complain of anything, that is the only document that is even remotely analogous to a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.051" offset="2828183">Second, since that petition was filed on the very last day before the statute ran on the claims, anything that the government did after that date would be too late to save the claims anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.318" offset="2877189">If the test should be to look beyond the face of the government's first pleading, then tolling should commence only when the government first does something that could fairly be called a complaint that institutes a proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.155" offset="4416533">Now, I have been focusing on the government's petition as I said and there is another reason still.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.105" offset="4440356">The only alternative to that is to review the entire administrative proceeding to try to determine whether the government eventually did complain of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.736" offset="4478913">We submit that that imposes a heavy burden on the parties and the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.423" offset="4497617">It is an inherently uncertain process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.499" offset="4509946">If the government's position is not clear enough at the outset of the proceeding to enable it to state it in a proper complaint, parties will have no notice that their conduct is being complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.934" offset="4559684">If the government is unable to state a complaint at the outset, how is a party to know from the way it conducts itself later during the course of the proceeding, whether it is complaining of something?</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.120" offset="4604405">Indeed, if the government is that uncertain at the outset, it is likely to change its position during the course of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.945" offset="4631677">What would one do in that case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.125" offset="4640454">Does tolling depend on the position the government ends up taking or does the statute start and stop with each change in the government's views?</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.364" offset="4673368">The result of that approach in general would be that the parties would not know where they stood on the anti-trust statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.532" offset="4702103">But, in any event, the result of that approach in this case is that Mt. Hood's claims would still be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.656" offset="4730524">Now, the decision below is bad policy for another reason as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.516" offset="4745989">It would take a very specific and limited tolling provision, an exception to the statute of limitations and broaden it to the point where there would be practically no statute of limitations in regulated industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.310" offset="4797189">One can hardly pick up a trade valuation report without reading of some Justice Department intervention or participation before one or another of the administrative agencies and that participation cannot fairly be distinguished from the government's neutral petition to intervene in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.812" offset="4863226">In other words, if the decision below is upheld, the anti-trust statute of limitations may well be found tolled by literally countless administrative proceedings that no one ever intended to prevent, restrain, or punish violations of the anti-trust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.186" offset="4928741">I would say a word about Mt. Hood's alternative theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.213" offset="4944833">Mt. Hood argues in the alternative that the statute should be tolled to prevent injustice because it, itself brought the ICC proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.765" offset="4979001">We submit that that makes even less sense than the 16(i) tolling theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.014" offset="5000004">In all of the good reasons for not suspending the statute under Section 16(i) are even better reasons for not suspending it by a theory of equitable tolling, first, it would be contrary to the policy of repose that Congress has sought to effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.768" offset="5059040">Second, it would create even greater uncertainty and unpredictability as to the circumstances and the period of tolling, but more fundamentally, equitable tolling simply does not fit the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.834" offset="5111285">In the first place, equitable tolling ought to depend on the plaintiffs having been diligent, but Mt. Hood was not diligent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.837" offset="5143259">It knew of its claims in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.347" offset="5153290">It did nothing at all about them until 1964 when it brought its ICC proceeding and it waited almost eight years before it finally filed the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.154" offset="5200519">We submit that that is not diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.237" offset="5208879">Mt. Hood's equitable tolling theory should fail for want of equity alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.258" offset="5228941">Contrary to the impression that Mt. Hood's brief seeks to leave, there is no forfeiture or threat of forfeiture in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.796" offset="5259138">Even if Mt. Hood looses on the issues before the Court, the judgment that would be remaining in its favor would be nearly double the total amount of its actual loss, as determined by the jury, for the entire period from 1953 to 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.937" offset="5335729">To recover double damages is not to suffer a forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.764" offset="5354955">Mt. Hood is not at all like the plaintiff on the Burnet case, on which it relies, who stood to lose all remedy whatever for his injury of the statute had not been tolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.020" offset="5396020">We find no excuse for Mt. Hood's failure to wait eight years to file this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.291" offset="5417127">The Court's decision in Johnson against the Railway Express Agency ought to be dispositive on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.227" offset="5440846">In any event, none of the excuses that Mt. Hood has offered has any merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.949" offset="5459759">It says that it delayed filing this case because it wanted to get an injunction, but it is hard to see how that could excuse the delay if Mt. Hood had really believed that it could not file this case sooner because it could not ask the Federal Court for injunctive relief, and it is even harder to understand why it asked the Federal Court for injunctive relief when it finally did file this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.154" offset="5560591">Now, the Doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction is no excuse either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.992" offset="5583893">Although Mt. Hood would have us believe that its failure to act was in reliance or rather respect for that doctrine, the theory is plainly an afterthought, was not even raised in this case until after the trial when the case had been pending for more than five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.830" offset="5655259">I think the Court's decision in the Johnson case makes it clear that Mt. Hood's resort to an administrative agency cannot excuse its failure to take the minimal steps necessary to preserve each claim independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.447" offset="5721715">In conclusion, Mt. Hood delayed filing the case for nearly twice as long as the statute of limitation permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.752" offset="5750972">It still stands to recover far more than it lost even if it cannot persuade this Court to extend the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.454" offset="5785767">There is no reason why Mt. Hood should not be held to the statutory period that Congress has prescribed for anti-trust plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.289" offset="5817114">Petitioner submits that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

Hood to recover damages proven for those years that Greyhound was found to have violated the anti-trust laws and to have fraudulently concealed those violations from Mt. Hood.</text>

Hood, charges be sustained in full and that respondent Greyhound also be found to be in continuing violation of Section 216 referring to the Interstate Commerce Act."</text>

Hood acted reasonably at that time and I believe that it should have done the same thing today, but what I am stressing here is that in 1964, the law of this country under primary jurisdiction indicated that his case would have been dismissed, not stayed and I would point out, Your Honors, the Carnation decision which was reversed by this Court in 1966 to substitute a stay for dismissal, but the Ninth Circuit, in 1964, had stated that such a case on similar facts to this case must be dismissed because the District Court lacked jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.317" offset="12681257">In addition to the requirement of primary jurisdiction as an element, I was stating that the second factor which was present here too is that the plaintiff is required to obtain its injunctive remedy in one forum and his damage remedy in another forum and is legally precluded from seeking both remedies in the same forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.922" offset="12759625">Thirdly, and this is one more factor which should be present and was present here, that despite this legal bifurcation of remedies between two forums, the plaintiff's claim is factually and legally identical so as to satisfy the requirement of notice stated in the Johnson case and thereby avoid the evils against which the statute of limitation is designed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.384" offset="12881460">With respect to that factor, I would point out that the claim here presented in both the ICC and the Court was factually the same and I submit that it was legally the same, and only the remedies were different and that is due to the bifurcation in the law confronting Mt.

            <text syncTime="3372.982" offset="13571824">Mt. Hood had no such option here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.173" offset="13580601">The Doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction also is a federal doctrine which directed plaintiff, Mt. Hood, to go to the ICC and it is particularly applicable here because of anti-trust exemptions claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.573" offset="13622188">Your honors, I would say this that the Doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction has always been invoked by defendants, never by plaintiffs, to protect defendants against premature lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.300" offset="13669104">I believe that the Primary Jurisdiction Doctrine should now be completed and that the statute of limitation should be tolled for those plaintiffs who lack in accordance with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.372" offset="13745381">On the point of equities, counsel for Greyhound stated that we do not have a shred of equity, that Mt. Hood was not diligent, and that our damages should be reduced from treble to double damages to avoid a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.623" offset="13794387">First, Congress said treble damages, it did not say double damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.173" offset="13824689">Secondly, Greyhound's claim regarding the equities requires that the equities be balanced and compared.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.695" offset="14082675">In 1964 prior to the time that it filed its ICC proceeding, Mt. Hood's president, Mr. Kennan, went to the Department of Justice and asked them to take anti-trust enforcement action against Greyhound.</text>
