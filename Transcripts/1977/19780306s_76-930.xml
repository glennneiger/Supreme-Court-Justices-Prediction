            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="12.148" offset="128578">This case concerns the Ports and Waterways Safety Act which was passed by Congress in 1972 and which regulates navigation on various inland waters of states including the waters of Puget Sound in the state of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.416" offset="193570">It also controls the design and operating characteristics of oil tankers.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.905" offset="215513">In 1975, the state of Washington adopted a statute which also regulates, in substantial respects, the operating characteristics of tankers.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.631" offset="258459">For one thing, it requires that any tanker of 50,000 tonnes or more take on a state licensed pilot, for another it requires tankers of over 40,000 tonnes to have certain design characteristics or are to be accompanied by tugs, and lastly it forbids tankers of over 125,000 tonnes from entering Puget Sound under any conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.329" offset="365247">Tanker owners and operators soon challenged the law on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.264" offset="384996">Their principal argument was that the Ports and Waterways Safety Act occupied this field and that the Washington statute was in conflict either with specific -- either specifically or in general with the scheme of the Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.648" offset="458557">A three-judge court agreed with the plaintiffs and held that the Washington statute was unconstitutional in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.399" offset="489486">We noted probable jurisdiction and we now reverse in part and affirm in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.973" offset="511846">In brief, we hold as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.709" offset="522818">First, the requirement that the tankers take on a state licensed pilot is valid as to ships in the foreign trade but invalid with respect to coast wise vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.794" offset="567121">Second, the state's design requirements cannot be enforced in face of the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.821" offset="587183">Third, tankers may nevertheless be required to be accompanied by tugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.712" offset="606828">Fourth, the exclusion of large tankers from the Sound is inconsistent with the federal scheme and cannot be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.733" offset="634831">I have filed an opinion with the clerk, an opinion for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.228" offset="656878">The opinion is joined in its entirety by the Chief Justice and Justices Stewart and Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.599" offset="682374">Justices Brennan, Marshall and Rehnquist join on the Parts IV and VI of the opinion and Justices Stevens and Powell join on the Parts V and VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.848" offset="723334">Justice Marshall with Justices Brennan and Rehnquist agree with him, dissents in part and concurs in part in accordance with an opinion he has filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.185" offset="760637">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part and he's joined by Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
