            <label>Mr. H. Warren Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="47.412" offset="269535">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.320" offset="285209">The facts of this case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.547" offset="298166">They arise out of the Sears Chula Vista store which is located somewhat South of San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.565" offset="326169">The store is a free standing store, not a part of the shopping center, surrounded on three sides by a parking lot and public streets and side walks on the fourth side by block wall separating the commercial property from private residences.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.427" offset="397640">In October of 1973, representatives of the Carpenters Union appeared at the store and demanded of the store manager Mr. Ochoa (ph) that Sears remove its employees from doing work which the union considered to be within the carpenter's jurisdiction and either obtain carpenters from a licensed contractor who would obtain those carpenters from union hiring hall or in the alternative that the store manager should sign what was called a short form contract with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.233" offset="536820">Mr Ochoa indicated that he would get back to the union, apparently for some reason he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.543" offset="558136">The union then placed pickets on the private property of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. signs indicating simply that they were sanctioned by the FFL-CIO and that they were from the Carpenters Union.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="135.877" offset="623442">Mr. Siegel, does the record show whether Sears was a member of the Building Trades Council?</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Warren Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="143.048" offset="652177">The record does not show that Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="145.123" stopTime="147.879">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="145.123" offset="660432">Or has it signed the master agreement?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_warren_siegel" startTime="147.879" stopTime="313.171">
            <label>Mr. H. Warren Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="147.879" offset="671403">No. Sears is however -- is not but I do not believe that is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.100" offset="688331">If it had been so the union, I think would have had other alternatives such as arbitration provisions and so on, Sears would have had also.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.319" offset="725215">In any case, the pickets were requested to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.343" offset="741307">They refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.513" offset="753950">They did leave after a while for a very short time, apparently some phone calls were made and they then re-appeared on the property and indicated they would not leave unless compelled to do so by legal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.362" offset="801389">Sears did not challenge the objective of the picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.405" offset="817584">It decides themselves we are not precise as to what the objective were but the conversations had before hand indicated several alternative objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.495" offset="853947">Sears did protest the location of the picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.773" offset="867008">Sears then apply to the San Diego County Superior Court for temporary restraining order which in California is a notice type hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.435" offset="901699">The court issued a temporary restraining order subsequently held a hearing which was on written record in California affidavits and in November 1973 issued a preliminary injunction the sole effect of which was to confine the picketing to the public streets and side walks surrounding the store and not the private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.819" offset="983201">In doing so the Superior Court considered not only issues that arose under California State Law such as whether this was commercial property or industrial property.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.503" offset="1021967">It considered also the necessity for maintaining the peace, the potential for violence in a trespass type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.738" offset="1050910">It applied a balancing standard, not unlike the Babcock &amp; Wilcox standard of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.509" offset="1086019">After the temporary restraining order was issued, the unions did picket on the public sidewalks surrounding the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.685" offset="1122695">At this point, we come to perhaps the only issue that was really in dispute in the record before Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.048" offset="1152161">Sears had affidavits which indicated that there had been effective picketing, people did decline to enter Sears property including some who were making commercial deliveries to the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.942" offset="1195733">The union said that the picketing on the public sidewalks was not effective, pointed to no specific instance of its lack of effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.964" offset="1227811">The Superior Court weighing that conflicting affidavits believe that Sears testimony which had pointed to several specific instances of effectiveness and did issue the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.995" offset="1275877">At no time, during the entire process of this proceeding which began in October finally resulting in the preliminary injunction on November 21st, 1973 or any time thereafter, as the union filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="313.171" offset="1332615">Is it fairly common in the California Superior Court, injunctive procedures for a temporary injunction to be issued on the basis of the written record with the consideration affidavits?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_warren_siegel" startTime="324.132" stopTime="657.634">
            <label>Mr. H. Warren Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="324.132" offset="1376500">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.408" offset="1377545">Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.732" offset="1378904">It would be unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.630" offset="1382456">The court has discretion to take oral testimony but it is highly unusual to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.038" offset="1404086">The issue therefore in this case has basically one of the procedure by which the rights of private parties have to be resolved in a peaceful picketing situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.866" offset="1447449">While this arises in a picketing context, the same problems would of course, be existing and whether its hand building or organizational activity such as Central Hardware solicitation activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.750" offset="1494887">The same basic problem arises in any kind of activity occurring on private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.205" offset="1516726">It is the position of the petitioner that the state court should have concurrent jurisdiction with the National Labor Relations Board to resolve these kinds of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.041" offset="1564060">In many respects the type of resolution that occurred in this case on a motion for an injunction is not unlike the situation where these issues are presented to a state court, for example, if an arrest have been effected.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.601" offset="1614319">If Sears had called the Sheriff and had the pickets arrested for trespass or for some other act, the state court would ultimately and I don't think there would be an issue that it would have jurisdiction to do so, resolve the criminal case and in so doing would have to consider not only the elements of state law that were involved in the particular crime but would also become involved in -- but undoubtedly be a defense and that is that the activity on the property was not some way privileged or protected by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.969" offset="1731766">Same thing would be true for example, if in the process of ejecting a union representative from the property, there was a lawsuit against the ejector for assault of battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.221" offset="1772830">Again the state court would be called upon not only to resolve the state elements of those torts but undoubtedly have to resolve the factual issues that would be raised in defense that the activity of the person being ejected was not some way protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.366" offset="1833434">Viewed in that context, the type of issues that the state court would resolve on an injunction motion are no different than those issues which very clearly and as to which there is no argument, the state court already has jurisdiction, even though the matter may have originated out of a labor dispute at some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.349" offset="1905323">Under Garmon, if we view this in the context the backdrop of state law, these are the kinds of issues that state courts have been resolving, since before there were states in effect, going back to the very earliest common law actions involving trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.783" offset="1979093">The advantage of allowing the state court to resolve this type of dispute is of course that it channels the dispute into a neutral form avoiding the necessity of self help.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.666" offset="2034577">The court would be very concerned that should self-help be exercised that that could very quickly lead to an active violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.112" offset="2076373">There is no issue under the current state of the law that the ejector could use (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="505.239" offset="2100928">That has been suggested by many of the commentators, and it has been mentioned in decisions of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.542" offset="2118064">If in fact one could use self-help to affect the removal of pickets from the premises and thereby channel the dispute at least as to the criminal aspects or the tort aspects of the case in to the state court, it seems illogical not to allow Sears in this particular circumstance, property owner to go into state court initially to have that dispute resolved without the necessity of exercising self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.128" offset="2240422">The significance or the benefit of state court in this particular circumstance, I think is very obvious under the act for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.334" offset="2277307">First, under the particular factual circumstances under which this case arose, there was no availability of any NLRB relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.427" offset="2321611">Since Sears was not challenging the objective of the picketing, merely its location, there was no way that Sears initially obtain a forum before the board to resolve this dispute but even if there were some procedure for doing that, at best, the board might at sometime find that in fact the union activity on Sears premises was not protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.593" offset="2410322">Sears, at that point would simply have to go into court to enforce the board orders since the board order is not self executing and would be right back where we were fighting it out in a court at some later time rather than at some earlier that at least would have the advantage of placing the issues at peace between the parties without exercising self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.285" offset="2493078">If this proceeding for example, had gotten back into the California State Courts or to a Federal District Court to enforce a board order, the board -- rather the court would not of course necessarily be bound by the NLRB decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.740" offset="2550861">There might be other issues that would have to be raised either under state law or federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.319" offset="2573222">One would hope that the court would give due deference to the board decision but the fact of the matter is that a determination of the board on and on for a labor practice charge is not res judicata or collateral estoppel in a subsequent precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.091" offset="2632259">So neither from terms of an access to a forum nor if they were a forum is a proceeding before the board and a remedy, an effective remedy where the circumstances involved location of the picketing rather than its objective.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Warren Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="699.629" offset="2878437">Because in the interim of time, between 30 days Sears could have exercised self-help and removed the pickets from the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.463" offset="2913754">Now granted that may have engendered the quicker filing of an unfair labor practice charge by the union although it did not do so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.646" offset="2942489">But if that had happened, if an unfair labor practice charge had been filed, the issues as to the exercise of self-help which still have had to been resolved in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.887" offset="2979478">If Sears for example had affected --</text>

            <text syncTime="725.757" offset="2982927">I suppose, nothing had started, Sears just did not get around to doing anything until after 30 days and then it decided that it was tired of this recognition picketing and went to state court for an injunction, claiming that they were trespassing and the union answered, well this is arguably prohibited by -- if these have not --</text>

            <text syncTime="754.179" offset="3096611">So, you would say, you are just urging us then to go even that far and saying that even if it is arguably prohibited or is prohibited on anybody's prediction that the state court should be free to go ahead or even though the general council in that circumstance can go right to court and get an injunction.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Warren Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="775.408" offset="3181562">All the more reason, Your Honor why access to state court should be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.645" offset="3202564">I think it is unreasonable to assume that a state court will ignore the implications of the act or any other principle that would be brought to its attention either by the union or the board in an appropriate case, if the state court should err in the balancing of the effectiveness of the location of the picketing or in any other issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.363" offset="3281349">Ultimately, the remedy of the board would be to go in and get an injunction against the further effectiveness of the state court injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.505" offset="3313950">There is a remedy for the board and the union under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.000" offset="3327952">There really is no remedy for the employer, if one must to wait any ultimate determination of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.796" offset="3351149">But Your Honor's question, I think points out the necessity of the position that we have taken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.425" offset="3377689">In effect, when these issues reach state court on the self-help or a tort claim and the courts are considering the defense, the activity is protected under the act, there is in effect, a determination whether the activity is actually protected rather than merely arguable.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.306" offset="3445189">So in this particular circumstance that decision as to whether the activity is truly protected would be made at an earlier stage which is to everybody's advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.542" offset="3482074">Again, if the state court errs a petition could be made to modify the injunction under state law and ultimately if the board or the union felt that the state court was not properly deferring to some federal principle, there are remedies available right now under the presence to that law for going in, getting injunction and on the principles of supremacy of the state court injunction would dissipate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.034" offset="4424050">The fact that they did not do so is discussed in the trial court record and may have been one of the factors that the court considered in determining whether in fact the location to which the court ultimately limited the picketing would be an effective one or whether the union really believed that it was engaging in protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.235" offset="4496879">We do not know that but it is discussed in the Superior Court record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.556" offset="4574202">In effect, we are condoning what may be in proper conduct by the union and leaving the property owner without a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.423" offset="4613594">It seems that it would be more effective to channel it into the forum of the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.092" offset="4644314">Now, it is interesting to note that all of the briefs in this case including the brief of the board do concede, I believe that trespass, the regulation of trespass is a valid state interest, a very one deeply routed state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.986" offset="4703873">So I submit that under Garmon, under one of the exceptions that the court announced that the fact that trespass has historically been a matter of deep state interest, every state has laws concerning trespass is a valid ground for invoking the jurisdiction of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.677" offset="5050675">There is nothing in the record, for example, to show that the Superior Court believed that the Sears affidavits were correct and that the union affidavits were incorrect, that kind of determination was not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.619" offset="5094456">As a matter of fact, I was unaware until after the ruling had been made that any affidavits have been filed to effect that anyone had interrupted deliveries assuming that that was a union objective in the course of the picketing at the relocated areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.487" offset="5265924">And we had two different Superior Court judges involved in those proceedings which were unduly progressed and rather prolonged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.134" offset="5304481">The union sue sponte discontinued the picketing as being totally un-factual, after the court had ordered that the pickets to be relocated to the outlying areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.847" offset="5343351">I think the briefs in the appendix show that there is a great distance from the sidewalks around Sears store to the actual so called public sidewalk, if that is an appropriate term in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.592" offset="5398313">So that the cars where they were shooting in out from the public street to the public areas which were in all respects identical to any other area of Chula Vista which was in fact public.</text>

            <text syncTime="2638.010" offset="10631998">Yes this court has consistently recognized in effect that even though conduct is arguably protected it may nevertheless not be preempted absent the determination that it has actually protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.204" offset="10676719">Well, that with all due respect Your Honor for the concurring opinion in the Ariadne case, such has not been the Garmon doctrine rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.364" offset="10717366">The two cases which were cited are in opposite at page 11, one deals with the public employees strike, the other deals with violence and mass picketing, neither deal with the interpretation of 527.3 appropriate here.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Warren Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="2682.215" offset="10808794">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.424" offset="10821647">In response to the question I believe as asked by Mr .Justice White, the problem with the proposal of the board that Sears file a charge under 8(b) is of course I believe, I mentioned earlier that that goes only to the objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.439" offset="10885699">It does not deal at all with the location, so even in this case, if the board had found some impermissible objective, the union could simply have changed that objective to a valid one and we would be right back where we started now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.066" offset="10944213">It is interesting to note that both the board and the union have conceded in the briefs that there are some trespass situations which are already subject to injunction under state law, They give the example, of the Marshall Field case where you actually have people coming in to physical confines of the store, having made that concession that the state would have jurisdiction there, I assume that must be on the basis that there is already a board decision that that activity is actually not protected, therefore it is not very far adjunct to allowing the court to determine that same thing in the context of a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.618" offset="11086424">For the very reasons, I mentioned earlier, that whenever a court either a state or federal, ultimately resolves these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.613" offset="11118398">In effect, they are deciding whether there is actual protection, not merely arguable protection and many times of course they do disagree with the board, as to that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.055" offset="11164164">I do not want to burden this argument too lengthy by arguably state law because, I do believe that that The California Supreme Court had an opportunity to resolve the issues of state law raised by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.391" offset="11209513">As a matter of fact the statute to which they refer became effective January 1, '76.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.201" offset="11232709">So this case was argued, if my memory serves me correct that before the California Supreme court April of '76, the California Supreme court decision was in September of '76.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.643" offset="11274505">If the court had felt compelled by any of the arguments under state law, that were raised now by the union, it is to be assumed they would have resolved them not having done so, apparently there was agreement with the Court of Appeal in this case the California state law did not preclude the issue of the injunction and in fact we have cited two Court of Appeal decisions in California interpreting the new statute, while although they deal with somewhat factually different situations in construing the intent of the law, the new law, say was not intended to change preexisting law, there still must be a determination for example whether the pickets have a right to lawfully be at the location of which they---</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.037" offset="11492053">In any case both of those California Court of Appeal decisions which indicate that the new law does not change the preexisting law were denied hearings by the California Supreme court which in California is equivalent to a decision on the merits, not necessarily agreeing with the reasoning of the court but with the decision, and citable as precedent.</text>
