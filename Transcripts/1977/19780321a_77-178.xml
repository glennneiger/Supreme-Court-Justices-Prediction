            <text syncTime="30.019" offset="200036">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.463" offset="225740">Pertinent facts of this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.667" offset="242563">The original plaintiff, Clay Shaw filled the suit under Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act against Jim Garrison, then District Attorney of Orleans Parish in the state of Louisiana and certain alleged co-conspirators, including petitioner, a prominent New Orleans businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.862" offset="319363">Plaintiff claimed violations of his Constitutional Rights in connection with the district attorney’s prosecution of him for a New Orleans based conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy and the district attorney’s subsequent attempt to prosecute Shaw for perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.659" offset="386550">During the pendency of his civil rights action, Shaw died.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.711" offset="406821">He was a bachelor, leaving no spouse, child, parent or sibling, but only a will naming a friend as residuary legatee of his estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.682" offset="458648">The executor of Shaw’s estate, the respondent here today, was permitted over objections of defendants to substitute himself as plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.782" offset="499086">Defendants moved to dismiss the action because it did not survive Shaw’s death under the law of Louisiana, under which law, there is provision for survival of actions in favor of the stated familial beneficiaries only.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="120.011" offset="560003">Is that because of the nature of the action or does that apply across the board to any?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="malcolm_w_monroe" startTime="125.356" stopTime="295.631">
            <label>Mr. Malcolm W. Monroe</label>
            <text syncTime="125.356" offset="581319">There is a distinction in the Louisiana law of survivorship between actions for damage to property as opposed to personal actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.245" offset="616950">As to all personal actions, Mr. Justice Rehnquist the limitation as to the rights of the familial beneficiaries are enforced and the further basis of course of that motion to dismiss was that under Section 1988 of the Civil Rights Act, the law of Louisiana providing for the limited survivorship must be applied to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.339" offset="729277">The District Court denied defendants’ motions and on interlocutory appeal, the 5th Circuit affirmed the District Court’s holding at a Federal Common Law of absolute survivorship of Section 1983 actions should be formulated since estate law to which the Federal Courts must look under Section 1988 does not permit this action to survive and is therefore inconsistent with the purposes of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.062" offset="856127">Despite both Courts’ acknowledgement that the Civil Rights Act is entirely silent as to survivorship in 1983 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.101" offset="900326">This is a case which has been charged with considerable emotion, arising as it does from the assassination of a President of the United States and the subsequent prosecution by the district attorney of Orleans Parish of a well known New Orleans businessman for his alleged role in the alleged conspiracy to perpetrate that assassination.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.626" offset="1014429">The extent of that emotion is perhaps reflected by the referral by the Court of Appeals and respondent to Shaw’s injunction suit against a district attorney as constituting established facts in this case, although neither petitioner Robertson or Garrison’s other co-defendants in the civil rights action, who are defendants in that injunction suit and obviously any findings there could not be binding on them in this proceeding and also by respondents’ repeated references to the District Court’s characterization of the matter as one of the most bizarre episodes in American political and legal history and the Court of Appeals’ designation of the facts of this case as Kafkaesque, although this matter has been before both of those Courts simply on defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.786" offset="1395086">That is correct sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.085" offset="1408251">Especially in light of this emotional background of the case, the holding of the two lower Courts, refusing to apply the state law of survivorship to this case pursuant to Section 1988, since that law would not permit this action to continue and instead fabricating out of new cloth, a federal common law of absolute survivorship brings to our mind the dissenting opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Burger in the Nixon case when he said Mr. Justice Holmes speaking of a tendency of great cases like hard cases to make bad law went on to observe the dangers inherent when some accident of immediate overwhelming interest appeals to the feelings and distorts the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.939" offset="1615664">These immediate interests exercise a hydraulic pressure which makes what previously seems clear and seem doubtful and before which even well settled principles of law will bend.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.481" offset="1673864">Petitioner is here today before this Court seeking to neutralize the past hydraulic pressures in this case and to restore the subtle principles of law which had been bent by the Courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.740" offset="1734886">We may start then with the basic principle that there has never been any Common Law Rule, federal or state of survivorship of personal actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.487" offset="1785877">Thus we submit survivorship of an action is quite different from the matter of recoverable damages which was the question we believe sought to be presented to this Court in Jones vs. Hildebrandt and as to which they have been established federal rules which the Federal Courts have chosen to follow rather than state rules as was the case when the 3rd Circuit in Basista vs. Weir.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.530" offset="1897995">As to survivorship of actions however, we reiterate there has never been any such federal rule to be utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.760" offset="1926939">A further basic principle recognized by the 5th Circuit in its earlier Brazier vs. Cherry is that any amelioration of the harshness of the principle of abatement of actions upon death of the injured person must come from legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.791" offset="1999141">That is certainly as much an American rule as is the need for legislative authority for the award of attorney’s fees which was acknowledged by this Court in Alyeska Pipeline Service Company vs. Wilderness Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.635" offset="2070508">Turning then to the Civil Rights Act, it also spans beyond question that Congress made no provision for survival of civil rights actions under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.658" offset="2122544">Both Courts below readily conceded that point as have all Courts for as we are aware, which have considered this question and certainly this Court in Moor vs. County of Alameda also recognized the silence of Congress as to survivorship of 1983 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.683" offset="2198612">On the other hand, Congress did speak explicitly when it enacted 1988 to provide that when there is such a gap in the provisions of the Civil Rights Act, a common law, as modified and changed by the Constitution and the statutes of the state of the forum so far as the same as not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of United States, shall be extended to and govern the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.218" offset="2328806">Thus as the Appellate Courts in the 4th Circuit in Dean vs. Shirer, the 5th in the Brazier case, the 6th in Hall vs. Wooten in opinion written by the present Solicitor General and the 7th in Spence vs. Sterris have all recognized that Congress in enacting Section 1988 of the Civil Rights Act had adopted the state law of the forum as the Federal Law or Federal Common Law of survivorship of civil rights action.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.133" offset="2468509">Amicus in its brief filed with the Court, simply clouds the issue we submit by referring to choice of law rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.443" offset="2505708">Since they only apply when there is no such congressional mandate as Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.196" offset="2536741">This Court so recognized in the Moor case, when in considering Section 1988, it said that this meaning Moor, is a wholly different case from those in which lacking any clear expression of congressional will, we have been called upon to decide whether it is appropriate to look to State Law or to fashion a single federal rule in order to fill the interstices of Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.172" offset="2668607">In the instant case we submit, accordingly involved statutory interpretation and not choice of law rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.966" offset="2703820">This Court should cast aside these false issues which have been injected and follow we submit, the submitted clear language of 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.568" offset="2738197">The only qualification which Congress stated in that section was that the state law not be inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1182.842" offset="4811275">I think that rightly or wrongly, I think that the Courts have gone that way is my point sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.621" offset="4854429">We submit there is nothing in the legislative history of the Civil Rights Acts to support the proposition that when Congress enacted Section 1986, in 1866, Section 1983 in 1871 that it intended that there should be an absolute survival of actions under the Civil Rights Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.108" offset="4952336">To the contrary, the survivorship law of Louisiana is not inconsistent with the Civil Rights Acts, we feel is demonstrated by the action of Congress itself in 1871 in enacting Section 1986 when it rejected a Senate amendment and a subsequent committee version, both of which included a very broad absolute survivorship of actions provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.552" offset="5070096">Instead 1986, as adopted by Congress provided as explained by representative Shelabaga, the floor manager for the Bill for a limited survivorship actions under both Sections 1986 and Section 1985 which are the sections of the Ku Klux Act specifically aimed at the Acts of invidious discrimination of the Ku Klux Klan which so often resulted ultimately in death and which was certainly the prime motivation behind the enactment of the so called Ku Klux Act in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.396" offset="5241459">If the purpose and policy of Congress were in fact that regardless of the provisions of State Law to be applied under 1988, there should be absolute survivorship of actions under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.619" offset="5306452">It seems obvious to petition at least that Congress would have required the same result as to actions under Sections 1985 and 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.373" offset="5349397">However, again representative Shelabaga recognizing that under Common Law, there is no survivorship of actions for a wrong to the deceased person, praised the limited survivorship clause of the amendment which became Section 1986 and advised his colleagues in the house that it operates as to actions under Section 1985 which was Section 2 of the Bill as well as those under Section 1986 which was Section 3 of the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.506" offset="5497982">He went on to explain that that clause was in his words “intended to secure it,” that is the right of action, “to the family of the deceased, to the exclusion, for example of the creditors just as all statutes do in the case where death occurs from railroad negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.818" offset="5591187">If Congress had intended that there be all encompassing unlimited survivorship Section 1983 actions as the Courts below have held, Congress would simply have so provided expressly.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.694" offset="5654717">It has been asserted that the deterrence objective of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 requires rejection of the Louisiana law of limited survivorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.444" offset="5701737">Here again it is inconceivable to petitioner that any such objective of Congress was so strong as to permit the Federal Courts to refuse to comply with the dictates of 1988 to follow and apply this state law of survivorship when Congress itself adopted 1986 as in that section, a very similar, limited survivorship of 1985 and 1986 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.090" offset="5824304">Certainly any objective of deterrence which Congress had in mind would have been even stronger we submit with respect to the types of invidious class action embraced in those latter sections of the Act than would be so as to merely a state action type of violation prescribed by Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.928" offset="5915628">The same analysis it seems to us is also appropriate with the argument of Amicus that Louisiana’s survival statute must be rejected as being inconsistent with the complete justice theme of the Civil Rights Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.114" offset="5992428">In fact, not only does Section 1986 restrict the survival to certain designated beneficiaries, but unlike the Louisiana statute, it goes further and the federal act also limits those beneficiaries to a recovery of only $5,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.009" offset="6071944">Thus, we submit the Louisiana statute cannot be said to be out of tune with the federal complete justice theme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.942" offset="6107680">Moreover, Louisiana statute is entirely consistent with every other Federal statute which has provided for survivorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.693" offset="6142684">Thus, whether the injured party is a railroad worker, the seaman, the lord of the admiralty, a longshoreman harbor worker, or one killed on the high seas, his action upon death survives only in favor of certain designated familial beneficiaries, not a friend remembered in decedent’s will as residuary legatee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.693" offset="6254697">Congress has accordingly directed, we submit, a course of action to be followed by the Federal Courts in this action and that is fill the interstices of the Federal statute with the State Law of survivorship, adopt as Federal Law or Federal Common Law if one will, the Louisiana law of survivorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.917" offset="6351559">Congress having spoken as it did in Section 1988 with respect to adoption of State Law, and having been otherwise entirely silent as to survivorship of Section 1983 actions, the view of this Court in Alyeska as to award of attorney’s fees in a civil rights action is appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.484" offset="6433897">That is the Civil Rights Acts do not contain the necessary congressional authorization for the Courts to formulate a federal common law of absolute survivorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.560" offset="6478201">As this Court said in Chevron Oil vs. Usan, interpreting a provision in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act very similar to Section 1988, Congress made clear provision for filling in the gaps in Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.558" offset="6538178">It did not intend that Federal Courts fill in those gaps by creating new Federal Common Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.420" offset="6573600">The several arguments advanced by respondent in Amicas as well as by the Courts below as to the need for uniform and absolute survivorship of civil rights actions are policy matters, we submit, which are properly addressed to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.257" offset="6648937">It is respectfully submitted that the law of Louisiana as to survivorship of actions should have been followed and applied by the Courts below to this action pursuant to Section 1988 of the Civil Rights Act and that since plaintiff left none of the designated familial beneficiaries in whom this action could survive, this action should be dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.613" offset="6922387">All concerned agree that if you are going to interpret 1988 to mean that the State Law must be applied, the statute that would applied would be Article 2315 of the Civil Code and the action of the plaintiff would abate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.356" offset="7009322">We very briefly stated our position with respect to the application of the State Law is that the State Law applies solely and only if through the application of the State Law, the action will be allowed to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.410" offset="7081525">That any inhospitable statute or state survival statute is not to be applied because of the very simple fact that the trend and the theory of the Civil Rights Laws is for the actions to continue despite the fact of the death of the plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.573" offset="11278253">I was faced with Danbrowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.035" offset="11292046">Danbrowski this Court said applied only to the protection of my First Amendment Rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.280" offset="11413045">We went to trial, but then when this malicious District Attorney came along subsequent to the trial of the case, we had a 40 day trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.538" offset="11506041">On the very next working day Garrison himself goes in and files a Bill of Information against Shaw charging that he committed perjury when he took the witness stand to defend himself and testified that he did not know and had never seen or was he ever acquainted with Oswald.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.883" offset="11607500">The State Court refused to suppress, refused to dismiss.</text>

            <text syncTime="2891.959" offset="11647729">Fortunately by this time, we had Younger versus and Harris and Perez versus Ladesma and I was able to convince the Trial Court that I had those special circumstances which would enable that Court to enjoin that Second State Court Criminal Proceeding and the verdict and the judgment of that Trial Court in that second injunction suit was maintained again by the Fifth Circuit and this Court refused writs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.161" offset="11796522">This is not the first time the Shaw Case has been before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.427" offset="11829646">I filed a very substantial jurisdictional statement seeking relief from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.903" offset="11855559">I have been fighting this thing since March 1, 1967 and I say to this Court that despite counsel’s statements to the contrary sure there is emotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.525" offset="11902057">This man’s federally guaranteed rights were maliciously violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.453" offset="11925776">This man was used as nothing more than a conduit to an adversary preceding for the trial the Warren Commission Report.</text>

            <text syncTime="3045.278" offset="12261084">Counsel for the petitioner made mention of the fact that the findings of fact in the injunction suit where the Court specifically found that Shaw’s constitutional rights had been violated were not binding upon the defendants in this civil proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.891" offset="12371530">I am here telling the Court that in addition to the fact that you must take my complaint for the purposes of this appeal as being factually accurate in every respect, you have another basis for taking it as factually accurate and taking as a statement of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.942" offset="12447703">The fact that Shaw’s federally guaranteed rights were violated because it has been judicially adjudicated that such is the fact and I submit to you that it is a simple procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.772" offset="12499007">We can analyze.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.397" offset="12513531">If the State Statue allows the action to survive, the State Statute is applied and this is what the Civil Circuits which have considered the question have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.100" offset="12560343">The Seventh Circuit did it recently in Byrd versus Johnson decided in December of 1977.</text>
