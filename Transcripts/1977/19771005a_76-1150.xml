            <text syncTime="14.934" offset="139820">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, my name is James H. Goetz.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.070" offset="164375">I am from Bozeman, Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.465" offset="173988">I represent the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.795" offset="183287">This case presents a challenge on constitutional grounds to the statutory system of the State of Montana by which big game licenses are made available to hunters who are not residents of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.741" offset="247026">The Montana statutory scheme is challenged on the basis of two provisions of the United States constitution, Art.IV, ยง 2, the Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause and Amendment Fourteen, the Equal Protection Clause of that Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.721" offset="319020">The statutory system is challenged in two parts, the first is challenge goes to the severe license fee differential, implicit in the Montana statutory scheme that is the differential between resident and non-resident big game hunters.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.621" offset="398536">The second challenge goes to the requirement that the non-resident in order to hunt in Montana must buy what is called a Combination License and that Combination License, I believe is described adequately in the appellant's opening brief.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="110.051" offset="520267">But it is just a -- you can get it if you just pay some money, quite a bit of more money.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_h_goetz" startTime="116.297" stopTime="146.585">
            <label>Mr. James H. Goetz</label>
            <text syncTime="116.297" offset="545240">Yes, that is true, in that sense, it is the same and in that sense, our position, appellant's position is that it is a means of indirectly gouging, if you will of a non-resident hunter to increase the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.580" offset="602396">However, in the constitutional sense it is different, because the state shows to defend the Combination License, four reasons unrelated to the monitory or a cost justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.722" offset="654954">So I think it presents a different issue in that regard.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="146.585" stopTime="151.809">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="146.585" offset="666448">Do you analogize this to your legal tie-in sale?</text>

            <label>Mr. James H. Goetz</label>
            <text syncTime="151.809" offset="687346">Yes, I think I would, I have not thought about it in that context right away, but I think it would be something like an illegal tie-in and in the sense that it entails an indirect imposition which must be undertaken by a person in order to avail themselves of the right to hunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.966" offset="771983">I think in that sense it is much like an Anti-Trust Tie-In, if I understand your question correctly.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="178.547" stopTime="182.022">
            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="178.547" offset="794344">Did the District Court address the Combination License issue?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_h_goetz" startTime="182.022" stopTime="206.189">
            <label>Mr. James H. Goetz</label>
            <text syncTime="182.022" offset="808241">In my judgment the District Court did not, there is one Footnote in the District Court's opinion which suggests that the District Court addressed that issue simply as another aspect of the increase in fees, somewhat along the lines of Justice White's question here today, I believe it is clear the District Court did not address it directly.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="206.189" stopTime="209.037">
            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="206.189" offset="904894">Do you think it is before us?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_h_goetz" startTime="209.037" stopTime="320.975">
            <label>Mr. James H. Goetz</label>
            <text syncTime="209.037" offset="916283">Well, yes I do because it was presented in the District Court and the District Court rejected the plaintiffs and the appellant's challenge to the Combination License and there is absolutely no doubt from the record that that issue was presented squarely and specifically and as I say, it was referenced in the Footnote, the District Court did not address it at least as I thought they should have as a separate issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.718" offset="1031013">Now, the position of the appellants on the constitutional issue is that the Combination License is simply unconstitutional under both provisions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.928" offset="1083780">With respect to the fee differential as a severe fee differential, it is position of appellants that that as supplied in Montana is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.485" offset="1130069">But that the case Toomer v. Witsell and the companion case from Alaska, Mullaney v. Anderson, leave room on the fee differential for some additional assessment for non-residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.324" offset="1193390">If that assessment is reasonably related to one of two factors or both, those factors are if the state residents can contribute taxes which go to the resource or to conservation, which the nonresident does not then to that extent the non-resident can be assessed a higher fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.213" offset="1284923">The second aspect of the Toomer and Mullaney standard is that if the non-resident imposes some additional enforcement burden, then to that extent the non-resident can be assessed an additional fee by the state.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="325.697" offset="1382935">Both Toomer and Mullaney involved commercial enterprises, that kind of calling or making a living thing that I think Bush at Washington first referred to in Coryell v. Corfield, do you think those automatically carry over to big game money which certainly is not a way of making a living at least for the people who come in and hunt?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_h_goetz" startTime="350.040" stopTime="422.163">
            <label>Mr. James H. Goetz</label>
            <text syncTime="350.040" offset="1480215">Your Honor, I do not think that they automatically carry over, that is I do appreciate a difference between recreation and the pursuit of a common calling.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.091" offset="1524518">However, it is appellant's position here that when logically analyzed and with due regard to the precedent in the area that indeed Toomer and Mullaney do apply to the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.086" offset="1584496">If I may expand on that, I would say that that there is some question about how far the privileges and immunities as far it goes to what it applies, and I have looked at the two most recent or two of the most recent announcements by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.012" offset="1660146">The most recent being Austin v. New Hampshire and there the case did not not my in my guessing, address very specifically the question of what is the nature of the right, rather the opinion of the court went to the purposes of the privilege, the interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause namely to promote comity among the states and that issue was certainly and that purpose is certainly brought to bear in present case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.041" offset="5128267">Appellees submit that this analysis without any support in the judicial history of the P&amp;I Clause and indeed from the earliest interpretation in Corfield v.

            <text syncTime="2195.826" offset="8863359">Another appellant's witnesses testified that the license fee should be determined on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles and that no one should become bogged down in any measurement of value.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.424" offset="10769776">Based with this increase in the number of nonresidents, the legislature simply increased fee for the nonresident license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.838" offset="10795480">The state shows an economic means to limit the number of hunter days and the method plainly is not arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.611" offset="10818572">With respect to the combination license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.539" offset="10830275">The record below indicates that nonresidents hunt in larger groups than the residents, they usually come in groups of four or more and that license swapping is a problem and it is likely to recur more among nonresidents whereas residents tend to hunt in smaller groups, one or two and in tempting to force its conservation laws, the State of Montana has adapted the equal responsibility law, they have a state of about 145,000 square miles and they have 70 game wardens at this time, which means that each game warden is supposed to cover an area of about 2,000 square miles, it is very difficult to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.943" offset="10987846">But the state does have over 400 licensed out fitters and guide and so the legislature in its wisdom said that if a violation occurs in hunting party, which is guided by a lot of license outfitter and guide then unless that guide or outfitters reports a violation, he himself is equally responsible with the person committing the violation, because of the fact that there is license swapping, because of the practice, people going out and one buys a license for deer, one buys a license for elk and then if they come upon the one and he is not licensed for it, they still make feel that they can take the deer or the elk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.663" offset="11154716">Because of that problem the legislature decided to establish the Combination License so that whatever you tended to come across, in so far as bear, deer and elk are concerned, you would be licensed for that and the record below indicates that nonresidents utilize outfitters more than residents, perhaps the size of 50% in some areas of Western Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.869" offset="11463588">The attack on that, the Equal Protection in fact, they said, on the basis of wealth because some districts had less valuable properties than others that the school districts were being deprived of their Equal Protection Right, but the court referring to local control, the school districts which was fostered by the Texas plan concluded that the plan was not irrational because people of Texas maybe justified in believing that other systems are financing would lessen desired local autonomy and in Salyer Land Company v. Tulare Water District which involved boarding in water districts that was limited only to land owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.756" offset="11619173">The court said that that there was no violation of the Equal Protection Clause, because the state of California could conceivably take into account that land owners as opposed to residents would not be willing to join in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.613" offset="11974543">I might say in that connection that one of the nonresident plaintiffs, however is a property owner in Montana and I think one of the problems with Mr. Lenzini's argument on depredation is that he is equating non-residency with property ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.026" offset="12052179">There may be nonresidents who own property, who contribute likewise to the elk resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.792" offset="12075271">Obviously the incident to that is lower than resident property owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.344" offset="12125531">In response to the Appellee's position, first I would like to say with regard to the ownership question that I think that this court has settled that issue in the recent decision in Douglas v. Seacoast Products where the opinion indicated that rather than viewing wildlife and some kind of ownership context, the proper way to look at the wildlife resources to the traditional police power's concept and that is the position that appellants have taken throughout this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.442" offset="12265860">I believe the language in Douglas Seacoast is very strong in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.250" offset="12285087">Now, with respect to the Equal Protection issue, Mr. Lenzini has argued that the both the license fee differential and I understand also the Combination License requirement, both of those are very important management tools and the thrust of the District Court decision is that this is a valid conservation measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.291" offset="12385292">I think the record throws substantial doubt on that for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.129" offset="12408594">First of all, the State of Montana did not attempt to justify this in the District Court as a conservation measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.216" offset="12444956">Secondly, Montana in 1975 charged residents only $4 to hunt an elk.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.690" offset="13882840">Well, isn't as Mr. Justice White suggested in very early in your argument, is this not really one problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.976" offset="13920038">Let us say that Montana had said that in order to hunk elk, you also had to be licensed to tigers and elephants and zebras.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.241" offset="13965074">In other words, wholly unrealistic, but that is what you have to do to get an elk license, and you have to pay $225 for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.241" offset="14009064">Is this not realistically the same as though they set it to $225 fee?</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.403" offset="14033723">Well, in one sense it is and in the sense that if you look at the Combination License as simply a way to assess more fees to the nonresident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.006" offset="14068100">However, in constitutional sense what that Combination License is, is excess baggage that is conceivably although I do not believe it should be the case, this court could hold up a reasonable or an unreasonable differentiation and still find the Combination License so arbitrary and capricious which it seems to me it is, of that it would strike that down, and that would be the argument I would be making here, if I thought this differential was reasonable under the Toomer standard, not withstanding the Combination License.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.882" offset="14219611">That is we would just attack the Combination License.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.650" offset="14230687">However, we think that the differentiation cannot make the Toomer and Mullaney standards in any event, so to that extent, I think they are two separate issues and as Mr. Lenzini pointed out, he tried to justify them of the Combination License on a separate basis.</text>
