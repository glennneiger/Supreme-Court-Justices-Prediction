            <text syncTime="7.457" offset="109758">The first of this trio is number 76-1607, Securities and Exchange Commission against Sloan.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.268" offset="144971">The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 empowers the Commission to summarily suspend trading in any security for a period not exceeding 10 days if in it's opinion the public interest and the protection of investors so require.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.244" offset="216860">Acting under this authority, the Commission twice issued a series of consecutive 10-day order, suspending trading in the common stock of a corporation for over a year each time.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.493" offset="265865">Respondent, Sloan who owns stock in that corporation challenged in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Commission's statutory authority to issue these consecutive summary suspension orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.394" offset="317483">The Court of Appeals agreed with respondent Sloan and held that the Commission was not empowered by Congress to issue successive orders to curtail trading in the security for a period beyond the initial 10-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.025" offset="375998">We granted certiorari at the request of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.509" offset="389999">In an opinion filed today with the clerk of the Court, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.833" offset="411211">Under the Act, the Commission does not have the authority based upon a single set of circumstances to issue a series of summary orders that would suspend trading and the security beyond the initial 10-day period, even though the commission periodically redetermines that such action is required by the public interest and for protection of investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.006" offset="495952">Mr. Justice Brennan joined by Mr. Justice Marshall has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.561" offset="518208">Mr. Justice Blackmun has also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
