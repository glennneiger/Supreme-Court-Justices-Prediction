            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="14.657" offset="138600">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.807" offset="151139">This case comes before this court on the Government’s petition for review of a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, holding that although respondent’s conduct in this case falls within the language of the Hobbs Act, 18 U. S. C. Section 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.468" offset="213832">It was nonetheless not within the reach of that Act because it did not also constitute racketeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.626" offset="238388">Accordingly the Court of Appeals concluded that respondent’s conduct fell within the exclusive criminal jurisdiction of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.940" offset="271720">Let me reiterate at the outset that there is no dispute that respondent’s conduct fell within the express terms of the Act which reaches the conduct of whoever in any way or in any degree obstructs delays or affects commerce by either robbery or extortion or who attempts or conspires to do so.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="67.795" stopTime="71.361">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="67.795" offset="351132">You say there is no dispute except that the Court did not seem to follow that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sara_sun_beale" startTime="71.361" stopTime="317.395">
            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="71.361" offset="365343">Well, there is no dispute that it falls within that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.840" offset="375269">The question is whether the Act should be construed to have an additional limitation to racketeering, but it falls within the express terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.526" offset="405989">The evidence showed that in April of 1975, respondent and his accomplice attempted to extort a $100,000 from the federally insured bank that was doing business in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.354" offset="457294">Respondent’s accomplice telephoned the bank’s president and threatened to detonate remote-controlled bombs at both the bank and the home of the bank president unless certain instructions were followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.088" offset="508285">The bank president then took a package of false currency that has been supplied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and left it at the spot that has been designated by respondent’s accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.559" offset="554156">The respondent and his accomplice never picked up this package because it was found almost immediately by two small children who opened it and tore apart the packages of false currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.450" offset="605774">Following a Jury trial in the Northern District of California, respondent was convicted of both the violation of the Hobbs Act and also of attempted bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.297" offset="649137">Although the Court of Appeals reversed both of these two convictions, the government seeks review in this court only of its ruling regarding respondent’s conviction under the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.038" offset="692082">The Court of Appeals concluded relying upon an earlier decision of the Sixth Circuit that conduct such as respondent’s, which was prescribed by the express terms of the Hobbs Act must also be proven to constitute racketeering in order to be within the reach of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.959" offset="763762">The Court rested this construction on the Act on two distinct grounds; first on its reading of Congressional Intent and second on its view of the considerations of Federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.350" offset="817365">The Court did not in its opinion defined the term “racketeering” and that is the point to which I will return later in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.920" offset="843592">It did however conclude that there was no evidence of “racketeering” in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.086" offset="864281">Judge Carter dissented from the reversal of the conviction under the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.026" offset="884030">I want to stress that the Court of Appeals did not suggest and respondent does not contend that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to prohibit all of the conducts which does fall within the express terms of the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.231" offset="936902">The breadth of Congress’ power under the Interstate Commerce Clause is firmly established and it is in no way a questioned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.548" offset="966159">The Court of Appeals simply concluded that considerations of Federalism militated against any conclusion that Congress had intended, what that Court viewed as a major incursion into areas of State concern and as a result that Court adopted the limiting construction of the Act which is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.460" offset="1045780">The language of the Act itself, which is of course the primary guide to its meaning, contains no support for this construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.703" offset="1078694">The Act does not define nor does it even mention the term “racketeering” nor does it contain any qualifying words that might be thought to exempt conduct which may not amount to racketeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.587" offset="1130312">Instead, the Act is broadly drafted to reach anyone, who in anyway or degree obstructs or effects commerce by either robbery or extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.122" offset="1172422">Accordingly, the high of this Case is respondent’s contention that the sweeping language which Congress employed requires the limiting construction of the Act in order to prevent a wholesale invasion of the criminal jurisdiction of the States, a result which respondent contends was not within the intention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.474" offset="1253819">I would like to turn first to the question of the legislative history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.870" offset="1271374">I will not attempt here to review in great detail the various Congressional Committee reports that were issued in connection with both the Hobbs Act and its immediate predecessor the Act of June 18, 1934, nor will I try and review in detail the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.935" offset="1327694">These matters are discussed at length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.382" offset="1341486">I do want to make two principal points in connection —</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="317.395" stopTime="322.720">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="317.395" offset="1349532">I take it the theory your case is you do not need to look at the legislative history at all?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sara_sun_beale" startTime="322.720" stopTime="357.856">
            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="322.720" offset="1370848">Well, I think that the language of the Act is very plain, but when one looks at the legislative history one finds nothing that supports the conclusion that is really at variance with that plain and very broad language.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.517" offset="1429989">My first point in connection with the legislative history of the Act is that although it was an outgrowth of Congressional concern with so called “racketeering” that in no way indicates that Congress intended some unstated limitation which appears neither in the Act itself nor in the committee reports to some concept of racketeering whatever that maybe.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="357.856" offset="1511387">Mrs. Beale, has the Government utilized the Act to in cases such as this only recently?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sara_sun_beale" startTime="367.105" stopTime="381.205">
            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="367.105" offset="1548376">I think there has been no substantial change in the enforcement of the Hobbs Act in some 30 years since it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.104" offset="1580350">It has received no new construction and I am not aware of any substantial change.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.205" offset="1604801">Has they believe it has been restricted to the way across the state line?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sara_sun_beale" startTime="386.499" stopTime="459.140">
            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="386.499" offset="1625908">Well, there are simple policies that are currently used by the Department to determine what are appropriate areas or appropriate kinds of cases in which Hobbs Act should be enforced and they differ according to whether robbery or extortion is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.526" offset="1702081">The Department at present and I am not certain when this policy was first promulgated, it is not of particularly recent origin, but in robbery cases, the Department as a matter of policy restricts prosecution in most instances to cases where there is either a showing of organized crime involvement or an extensive scheme of some sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.580" offset="1786299">Now, in practice there is also an attempt to limit other kinds of cases to areas where there is what is thought to be a substantial federal concern and a point that I want to discuss shortly is that concerns really the reality of the concern with the invasion of State interests and a point that I was going to mention is that there were only 166 nationwide indictments under the Hobbs Act in 1976 and that perhaps will give some kind of an idea of what the enforcement pattern currently is.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.890" offset="1939481">You have cited the States Act Case in your brief if you remember, what was the substantial federal concern there?</text>

            <text syncTime="482.446" offset="2009699">Right, I think one of that considerations is of course and a theme that recurs in legislative history of the Act is a real concern for offenses which (A) affects commerce and (B) where the States have not acted on those prosecuting offences.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="498.882" offset="2075423">In other words, the substantial federal concern is that the State is not doing a good job of enforcing its own laws?</text>

            <text syncTime="503.681" offset="2094649">Well, I think that where interstate commerce has interfered by means of extortion where color of official right is involved, that is an area, particularly were the concern that Congress expressed whether that the States were not acting is being initiative.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.983" offset="2179912">I would not disagree that States Act maybe a case that is on the fringes and that there may not among a 166 prosecutions in a year be some which are not on the edge of the commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.726" offset="2218783">Such as the present case accruing in the main —</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="536.862" offset="2227351">Is it not true that the statutes frequently have been used, at least in the Seventh Circuit, to prosecute political-type crimes where the local law enforcement authorities were not enforcing the local law?</text>

            <text syncTime="547.958" offset="2271759">Well, I guess I am not prepared to discuss particularly the Seventh Circuit enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.340" offset="2289313">I do think that it is clear that the Act itself contains this specific provision dealing with extortion under color of official right and that that fits quite comfortably with the concern in the legislative history and that where there are crimes affecting interstate commerce, and particularly where the States do not act, and that is very likely to happen in cases of official corruption, that that would be appropriate area of federal concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.428" offset="2381682">So I would not be surprised to see a pattern such as that in the Seventh Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.353" offset="4137320">In anyway, I do want to make a few additional points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.437" offset="4149650">One is that the legislative history clearly indicates that there was no settled meaning for the term “racketeering” although Congress was concerned in 1934 and in 1946 with a variety of problems that were described as “racketeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.076" offset="4212239">That term had no distinct meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.335" offset="4221225">The committee which was investigating the problem of racketeering found it necessary to adopt a working definition to guide its investigation and it stated that it was necessary to adopt such a definition because the term “racketeering” was being used to refer to activities that were not even criminal, to activities that were immoral, to activities that were fraudulent, to wide varieties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.669" offset="4314639">Another point that it seems inconceivable in that regard that a committee that was so aware of the vagueness of the definition of the term “racketeering”, would nevertheless have intended to make that a part of a federal criminal statute without mentioning it in the Act, without defining it, without making it as clear in the committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.818" offset="4391230">Another point regarding the legislative history of the Act, is that there is a suggestion both in respondent’s brief and by the Court below that because the originating committee was concerned with racketeering and because there are various expressions of support for the bill as an anti-racketeering measure, the bill should be construed as limited to this one kind of problem only to racketeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.989" offset="4495929">If that were true, it seems to me that all the ninety some bills that were proposed by the same committee at the close of its investigation on racketeering, which range from kidnapping to munity in Federal Prisons, to interstate transportation of stolen property, that all of those would likewise have to be limited to racketeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.927" offset="4567609">And it seems to be that it is simply not reasonable to construe all the committee’s work as limited to racketeering, when it never expressed the desire that that should be done and when this was not made an element of that particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.321" offset="4629258">I have already mentioned the fact that the debates on the Hobbs Act make very clear the fact that Congress was well aware of the fact that the crimes being defined in the Hobbs Act were crimes which are already punishable under State law and in deed it was recognized that the definitions which appear in the Hobbs Act were derived and were taken directly from the New York penal code.</text>

            <text syncTime="1182.207" offset="4808771">I think it is time to turn from the legislative history to the considerations of Federalism, which really underlay the Court’s reading on the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.440" offset="4853702">The first point that I would like to make is one which I touch on somewhat earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.105" offset="4872301">The Court of Appeals suggested that the limiting construction, which it applied to the Act was essential in order to prevent a really wide scale invasion and incursion on to the criminal jurisdiction of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.743" offset="4922874">Just mentioning response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question that the Act has never been interpreted nor was in intended to preempt the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.685" offset="4958714">In addition as I noted earlier, there has been no wide scale incursion into areas causing a general problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.862" offset="4995390">There were 166 prosecutions nationwide in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.555" offset="5014198">Again, turning to this particular prosecution, we think it is a good example of one where there is a strong federal interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.534" offset="5046068">The Federal Government (Inaudible) has a compelling interest in prosecuting under its own laws an attempted extortion from a bank that it ensures that serves businesses in many states and that is part of an industry that perhaps more than any other facilitates the flow of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.327" offset="5117225">In any event, even assuming that there are factual situations that fall within the literal language of the Hobbs Act, but in which there is no substantial federal interest, requiring proof of “racketeering” would in no way serve to screen out those cases in which there is a minimal federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.727" offset="5186815">Although the Court of Appeals provided no definition of “racketeering.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.658" offset="5202593">It seems clear that there is nothing inherent in their concept which suggests that racketeers prey only on businesses, on persons who are heavily involved in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.325" offset="5249196">Indeed the respondent’s brief indicates and cites a good portion of the legislative history to show that many rackets are of essentially local character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.502" offset="5289947">Therefore, limiting the Act to “racketeering” seems to have very little to do with a legitimate concern for state sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.874" offset="5319413">Indeed the fact that the prosecution we have at issue here falls out five scope of the Act, as it was defined by the Court of Appeals, despite the vital federal interest, demonstrates the fallacy of assuming that limiting the Act to “racketeering” will somehow serves the purpose of screening out these cases which are less directly related to the federal interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.172" offset="5520660">And it seems clear that Congress took the working definition of the committee in 1934 and adopted that definition in the 1934 Act to make it suitable for use in a federal criminal statute and changed the definition in two primary ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.636" offset="5590459">The working definition was as an organized conspiracy to commit either robbery or coercion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.286" offset="6005075">There is simply is other than the fact that they are just expressions of concern regarding racketeering, there is no showing that any limitation that was unstated in the Act to some definition of “racketeering” was intended so it is even a clearer case than that, which you make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.846" offset="6083338">So we believe that since neither the legislative history nor any concerns for Federalism justify importing a vague concept into the Act, which will simply make more difficult its enforcement, without in any way screening out cases in which there is a lesser federal interest shows that there is no grounds for the construction of the Act chosen by the Court of Appeals and we therefore respectfully submit that its judgment should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.073" offset="6252193">I suppose if (Inaudible) were to give a title to this Case he could title it, “The Lamentable Loophole” because I think that is what the Government is faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.030" offset="6292004">When the Bank Robbery Act which came as the result of the anti-gangster program from the mid-30s, it was considered in conjunction with the “Racketeering Act” the title given to the predecessor of the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.177" offset="6364624">The ultimate statute that came out of the 1937 Amendments, involved a crime of bank robbery which included as an element, intimidation, the essence of extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.580" offset="6426273">It required that this intimidation or the obtaining of the money to be from the person or presence of the bank officer and with the structure at that time with the bank laws in this statute, there was this gaping hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.846" offset="6495341">Unless the property was taken from the person or presence of a bank officer, it was not a federal bank robbery, nor would it be a loss in the FB taking or not trespassory in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.953" offset="6551765">So we were left with one novel class of offence that was uncovered, Extortion not from the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.400" offset="6589486">The Government’s luck, there were three alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.759" offset="6598995">They could have gone to Congress and have that loophole filled, corrected by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.243" offset="6620938">They could find another statute that fits or they could leave the enforcement to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.479" offset="6653852">Well, the Government has chose to take the second alternative and stretched commerce statute that was aimed at racketeering to fill the loophole and by doing so the inevitable consequence is a blanket intrusion into an area traditionally enforced by the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.421" offset="11413571">Well in 40 years, I suppose Congress realized that they may have to define terms more specifically then they did in the mid-30s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.151" offset="11460487">At that time they thought that probably there be no encouragement upon state police powers since at that time a direct effect to put into interstate commerce was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.281" offset="11493088">They were speaking in terms of the Poultry Racket and the shake downs that gave rise to Court’s decision of local 807.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.129" offset="11524435">They were not thinking that interstate commerce would mean upon a grocery store or a small business with just a de minimis affect on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.577" offset="11554214">And I do not think that there is any suggestion in the legislative history that Congress dreamed that this Extortion Act aimed at labor racketeering would ever be use to fill the loophole in the bank robbery statute and I think that is precisely what has been done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.625" offset="11614401">I do not think that relying upon the Justice Department to limit itself will solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.332" offset="11645225">I think that the Court has to find whether or not if this statute being broadly applied would be an intrusion into state sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.293" offset="11681065">I think the Court should give it a restrictive blast and prevent any upsetting of that delicate balance.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="2916.851" offset="11747312">Just a few brief points, the first is that, despite respondent’s arguments there is not one shred of legislative history that indicates intent to place an unstated limitation on this broad language to limit it only to some activities called “racketeering.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.690" offset="11822649">The 1934 Act was officially titled and I quote, “An Act to protect trade and commerce against interference by violence, threats, coercion or intimidation".</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.252" offset="11868938">That word racketeering is not mentioned in either of the two Acts, it is not mentioned in the titles and we do not believe that fair reading of the legislative history indicates that it was intended to have some unstated limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.524" offset="11925989">We think the fact that there is no definite definition of “racketeering” fully supports that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.296" offset="11961098">There is a definition of “racketeering” in Section 1961 of Title XVIII, that definition was adopted in I believe in 1970 and certainly it cannot be suggested that that definition was intended to apply in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.796" offset="12019090">The committee definition is clearly not what Congress intended to reach in either of the two Acts, the committee’s working definition, in view of the fact that the committee reports clearly reflect the fact that no limitations to conspiracy or to some kind of organized activity was intended to be required by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.859" offset="12095367">They purposely omitted that particular element and indeed I should note that the committee’s working definition was first publicly published in a report that appeared in 1937, detailing three years of its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.703" offset="12154717">That working definition does not appear in the committee reports which were put out to define the scope of the 1934 Act that we have in question here and they do not appear directly in connection with the legislative history of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.317" offset="12209157">It is simply a working definition of all of the work of a committee that introduced ninety some bills in 1934, bills relating to kidnapping, to mutiny in federal penal institutions, to interstate transportation of stolen property, as well as to the Act we had under consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.871" offset="12287419">Respondent seems to be arguing that what Congress ought to have done, is to have defined “racketeering” as it did in Section 1961 and then to have made that kind of activity punishable either generally because it found that all racketeering affects interstate commerce or only in so far that it affects interstate commerce, but Congress simply did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.224" offset="12368817">The legislative history does not reflect intent to do that and certainly language of the Acts does not reflect any such intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.083" offset="12404239">Furthermore the purpose, which respondent is suggesting a limitation of an Act is required; the purpose of keeping the Federal Government from intruding into the areas of state concern is in no way served by limiting this Act to racketeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.559" offset="12466201">It simply will not have the purpose of screening out cases where there is no very strong or very great federal interest, as it might be defined by individual Judges or Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.764" offset="12506952">Indeed, we think as the questions indicated by the Court today, that this is a case of a very strong federal interest, but at least as the Ninth Circuit construes the Act with the racketeering requirement, this case falls outside of the scope of the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.803" offset="12575184">So we think it is not a sensible limitation to limit the incursion on state jurisdiction and there is no support for it in the language or in the legislative history, which is detailed fully in our brief, thank you.</text>
