            <text syncTime="86.065" offset="424188">This is a Commerce Clause case.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.394" offset="433488">Appellants, Raymond Motor Transportation Company and Consolidated Freightways are interstate general commodity carriers who utilize twin trailer type vehicles in their operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.133" offset="488450">A twin trailer vehicle is a type of truck that consist of a truck tractor to the rear which is attached to 27 foot van riding on the rear of the truck tractor on a arrangement called a Fifth wheel, a turntable type arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.661" offset="546546">To the rear of this 27 foot van, there is attached a dolly which has a second turntable type arrangement on it and a second 27 foot van.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.944" offset="583744">Twin trailer offer significant operating advantages to general commodity carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.895" offset="603493">Because of the ability to separate the individual vans that make up a twin trailer and make them into new combinations, general commodity carriers are able to substitute the interchanging of vans for the unloading, sorting and reloading of cargo which is necessary when conventional 55 foot semi trailers are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.800" offset="687189">Because a twin trailer can be operated as a single unit, that is a single van with a single tractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.403" offset="713521">Twin trailers can be used for downtown delivery and pickups, where normally if a general commodity carrier we are using semi-trailer in this operation, you would have to unload the semi-trailer, reload the cargo into a straight truck, a short normal truck without a semi-trailer to operate in a downtown area.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.705" offset="2334784">The principle reason for that is the splash and spray which you see coming at your vehicle, a large part of it originates from the tandem drive axles of a semi, there are two axles that are located quite close to each other, the wheels are rotating and spraying water at each other where they hit, break up and spread out in mist that is common with trucks, that is located both at the tractor and at the rear of the semi-trailer, with the twin trailer there are no tandem axles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.677" offset="6530677">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.873" offset="6547395">Very briefly I am going to get back to the subject of safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.696" offset="6562755">But, the safety aspect, is I think obviously the one that has chiefly concerned Wisconsin's residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.920" offset="6607581">And it is not a scientific concern based upon lots and lots of scientific tests such as we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.560" offset="6646138">The reaction of the general public, the general driver who writes to his legislature and says, I am afraid of these, do not let them into our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.708" offset="6682814">Now, we have the testimony of the Chairman of our State Highway Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.959" offset="6699741">His testimony is set forth in the Appendix at the end of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.316" offset="6721161">He explained, that he had been in the legislature and he had seen these letters and he was aware of the public's reaction and fright over them and then as Chairman of the Highway Commission, he said, that out here we do as the legislature directs and we know that the legislature has failed to pass several laws allowing these longer trailers, trucks, vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.191" offset="6820740">And consequently, we know what we are expected to do out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.924" offset="6839653">And I asked him from his own experience and his statement was, as I reflect upon the kinds of letters, I am not reading all the words, in the days when I was still in the legislature, there concern meaning the constituents, seem to center around a commingling of vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.703" offset="6910810">That is -- well, I am sorry, I will not interpret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.113" offset="6920423">In this case 10 feet longer in the case of trucks and the ability to be able to pass to such a vehicle, caused a great deal of concern among the people at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.072" offset="6964205">Now, that is the reason that the law has not been changed in our state, the people have told the legislatures, they do not want it to change and they are afraid of these vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.133" offset="7012479">I say, no one claims that this is based on any scientific studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.097" offset="7028361">This is people driving on the highway, worried about what they see and afraid of big trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.198" offset="7052708">That is, as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.440" offset="7065664">That is the basis for, for the fact that our law has not been changed.</text>
