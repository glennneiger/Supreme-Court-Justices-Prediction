            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Urbanczyk</label>
            <text syncTime="17.183" offset="148624">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.401" offset="161476">This case is here on appeal by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.885" offset="179448">The judgment of United States District Court and Western District of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.515" offset="197943">The case generally involves entitlement provisions of Section 202(d) of the Social Security Act under Section 202(d) as the Court may recall from its consideration of the same statute two term ago in Mathews against Lucas, insurance benefits are provided to the children of a wage earner who himself is receiving old age or disability insurance benefits or who has died fully or currently insured under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.459" offset="313718">This is the second time this case has come to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.230" offset="324794">As I will explain in a minute the insurance provisions that are at issue in this case, cause the termination in appellee's Child’s Insurance Benefits in 1970 when he married.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.580" offset="370247">Appellee instituted this lawsuit to challenge the discontinuance of his benefits on the grounds that the provisions created classifications that violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.136" offset="416431">Originally the District Court agreed with appellee and declared the statute, the classification unconstitutional as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.429" offset="449659">At the time of that initial judgment in early 1974 the record did not reflect that although appellee's social insurance benefits were terminated, he and his wife nevertheless were receiving benefits under another title of Social Security Program Title XVI the new Supplemental Security Income program and that those benefits were only marginally less than the amount of benefits that he and his wife would have received had his Child’s Insurance Benefits not been discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.402" offset="569509">Because of the deficiency in the record when the secretary first appealed to this Court, the Court vacated and remanded for reconsideration of the case in light of these new circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.807" offset="607125">On remand record was supplemented by stipulation, but the District Court reinstated its original judgment, holding that the supplemental security income program was irrelevant to appellee’s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.226" offset="656862">The Secretary appealed the second time and that is the present posture of this case as the Court considers it.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.257" offset="688941">Let me describe briefly the provision of Section 202(d) that are at issue in this case and their effect on appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.956" offset="719765">Among other entitlement provisions of Section 202(d), the applicant or Child’s Insurance Benefits, that is the son or daughter of a wage earner must be unmarried, appellee was unmarried in 1957 when he originally applied for benefits up on the death of his father.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.517" offset="798028">Now the other eligible requirements of Section 202(d) include the requirement that the child be, at the time of his application, dependent upon the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.739" offset="834913">That was the requirement that the Court considered in Lucas and also that at the time of the application the child be either under 18 or a full time student under age 22 or that the child be disabled, the disability having begun before the child became age 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.658" offset="914534">Regarding the benefits of the disabled child, so long as the disability began before age 22, the benefits were continued without regard to age.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.432" offset="949643">Appellee Jobst for example is a child, is a person who has been disabled since birth and he was there for eligible to receive insurance benefits even though he was 25 when his father died.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.605" offset="1002305">In contrast the benefits to non disable children are terminated when the child attains the age of 18 or 22 depending on whether or not he is a student.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="241.234" offset="1044833">Counsel, do you know whether there are many marriages each year between insured disabled persons and uninsured disabled persons?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_l_urbanczyk" startTime="252.325" stopTime="291.382">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Urbanczyk</label>
            <text syncTime="252.325" offset="1089241">Mr. Justice Blackmun the record does not show the numbers that are involved in this case and I am not aware of the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.279" offset="1117035">I suspect, and this is confirmed by the Social Security Administration that the numbers are very, very low but I do not have exact figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.985" offset="1147860">The statute does provide that there are certain events terminate child insurance benefits, when the non disabled child reaches a certain age, is one, we just mentioned death is another.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.109" offset="1184327">Event we are concerned with here is marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.963" offset="1195821">Statute provide with one narrow exception, that all child's insurance beneficiaries whether they are disabled or non disabled, student or non student lose there entitlement to benefits when they marry that is what happened here.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_l_urbanczyk" startTime="294.944" stopTime="391.764">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Urbanczyk</label>
            <text syncTime="294.944" offset="1259664">Yes Mr. Justice Blackmun, as I will go on to argue the general termination rule is itself rational and because Congress amended the Statute in 1958 to provide a limited exception for certain disabled children does not change that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.006" offset="1327896">Simply introduces a new element in to the inquiry and as we have explained in our brief, the classification created by that narrow exception is rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.453" offset="1369692">There was a reason for Congress to treat that special class of beneficiaries under Title II of the Act and not appellee's situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.721" offset="1414831">Now when Child’s Insurance Benefits were first provided there was no narrow exception to the general termination rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.692" offset="1442730">In 1958 Congress amended the statute to provide that benefits would not be discontinued when a disabled child’s insurance beneficiary married an individual who also was entitled to insurance benefits under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.650" offset="1510544">In those cases the Amendment provided that marriage would not terminate benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.635" offset="1530501">I will explain the Congress's reason for enacting that narrow exception later but it is relevant here to know only that the rationale or the Amendment does not cover appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.998" offset="1567909">Appellee is a disabled child’s insurance beneficiary or was a disabled child’s insurance beneficiary but his wife was not an insurance beneficiary under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.871" offset="1603435">His marriage therefore like the marriage of most other child’s insurance beneficiaries, was terminated because of his marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.488" offset="1633842">Now central to the District Court’s reason in this case --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <text syncTime="394.177" offset="1656621">That’s correct and that was central to the District Court's analysis in this case is that his wife is disabled.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="399.269" stopTime="402.899">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="399.269" offset="1676996">And the reason she is not a beneficiary is simply that her parent was not covered.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_l_urbanczyk" startTime="402.899" stopTime="458.681">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Urbanczyk</label>
            <text syncTime="402.899" offset="1691520">That’s right, her parent was not an insured wage earner and therefore she was not entitled to benefits under Title II of the Act by the virtue of her mother or father.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.111" offset="1732376">That was central to the District Court's analysis in this case that is that his wife was disabled and unable to provide support for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.216" offset="1764767">Court suggested that termination is rational where the beneficiary marries someone who is able to support him.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.237" offset="1796846">But where the beneficiary marries someone who can not support him, the Court reasoned the need for support continues and so as a constitutional matter once benefits continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.610" offset="1834358">The record does reflect that Sandra Jobst, appellee's wife, is disabled and unable to provide support.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.449" offset="1861734">I hasten to point out that it is because of that disability and because of their need for assistance, that Sandra and John Jobst now receive a monthly benefit under the Supplemental Security Income Program and as I mentioned--</text>

            <text syncTime="515.900" offset="2143543">That is when they were married they were receiving a couple rate which per person was less, now that they are separated, the per-person Supplemental Security Income is increased.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.137" offset="2408425">Only a very narrow re-entitlement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.394" offset="2425456">I will discuss the significance of the SSI in a moment but for now I would like argue that even if SSI were not in existence, the statutory insurance provisions at issue in this case are constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.631" offset="2482403">In holding to the contrary, the District Court reasoned or drew significance from the fact that appellee remained needy after his marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.456" offset="2521796">But in so reasoning the Court fell victim to misunderstandings concerning open nature of Title II of the act and of the requirements of the due process cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.393" offset="2565473">Under Title II of the act, an individual’s actual need in a welfare sense has no part in the allocation of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.725" offset="2598805">Benefits are not paid on the basis of an individual’s need.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.314" offset="2613225">Rather Title II is a program of social insurance designed to protect the wage earner and his family from a loss of income occasioned by the wage earner's disability, retirement or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.831" offset="2663275">Benefits are paid to members of the wage earner’s family because they are presumed to be dependent on the wage earner and they are the ones who are most likely to suffer from a loss of the wage earner's income.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.064" offset="2708206">Plus it is this relationship of dependency with the wage earner that is the critical factor in determining an individual's entitlement to what we call secondary insurance benefits, that is benefits payable to the individual member of the wage earner's family on the basis the wage earner's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.954" offset="2783752">Now these propositions are hardly new to this Court, indeed in stating them I have been paraphrasing from many of the Court's recent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.744" offset="2810919">Decisions in cases such as Weinberger against Salfi, Mathews against Lucas, Califano against Goldfarb, Mathews against De Castro.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.697" offset="2846759">These cases all stress that Title II benefits are not paid on the basis of individual need, but instead are paid on the basis of the family's presumed need.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.032" offset="2888033">An individual's membership in that family and his presumed dependency on the wage earner's income.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.379" offset="2913424">That is why in De Castro where the Court considered claims of the divorced wife for benefits under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.144" offset="2940487">The Court said that arguments concerning the divorced wife's economic situation were “hardly in point”.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.722" offset="3586861">And that is what Title II is really all about, wherein so far as secondary insurance benefits are concerned that is the likelihood of dependency upon the wage earner, person's membership in the wage earner's family.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.107" offset="4088307">Now as we explained in our brief the narrow exception to the general termination rule is part of a broad set of amendments in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.537" offset="4122057">Several other provisions of the Social Security Act providing benefits to members of the wage earner's family require that that beneficiary be unmarried or unremarried, the widow or widower for example of the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.799" offset="4179109">The 1958 amendments added a savings clause to each of these provisions requiring or providing generally that insurance beneficiary’s benefits are not discontinued when they marry another insurance beneficiary under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.411" offset="4237518">The principle reason for these amendments is explained in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.542" offset="4254132">Congress understood that a marriage between two insurance beneficiaries caused a simultaneous termination of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.492" offset="4285897">If for example an aged widow married a disabled child's insurance beneficiary who remember is paid benefits without regard to age, both of their benefits would be terminated under the act as it stood prior to 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.558" offset="4342113">Congress recognize that this was a special form of hardship and I say special because it was uniquely caused by the internal workings of the Social Security Act and so Congress determined to the remediate the problem or the perceived hardship by amending the Act rather than establishing a new program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.334" offset="4409300">And it was easy to remediate this problem within the existing benefit structure without added administrative cost or without alteration of the method of allocating benefits under Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.293" offset="4449110">Marriages between insurance beneficiaries was a readily identifiable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.428" offset="4469590">Both of these person's status and situation was known to the Social Security Administration because they were already receiving benefits under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.258" offset="4500937">Moreover, the problem presented by these marriages could be readily resolved by simply amending the statute to provide that benefits not to be discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.933" offset="4539703">Sure these amendments were viewed as an easy cure to what was perceived as a flaw in internal workings of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.269" offset="4577006">Appellee did not marry another child's insurance beneficiary; therefore to the extent that he remained needy, his continued need was not occasioned by the circumstances that Congress sought to remedy in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.449" offset="4629669">Yes of course they accord no principle of constitutional adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.406" offset="4645551">The Congress may constitutionally spend money to solve one problem and not another, so long as this spending decision is not arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.478" offset="4677838">Here there was a good reason worked for resolving the problem of marriage between two insurance beneficiaries under Title II of the Act but not resolving the problem created by appellee's situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.654" offset="4730501">As I mentioned it was easy to identify the marriage of insurance beneficiaries but appellee's need which arises from his marriage to someone who is unknown to the Social Security Administration could not be identified without substantial alteration in the method of allocating benefits that is presently employed in Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.294" offset="4809078">Title II uses broad presumptions as to dependency as we said and that method would not identify appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.756" offset="4838962">I suppose it would also not be a sufficient indicator of need that appellee's wife is disabled since presumably disabled people may have resources or be able to otherwise, in some other way to provide support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.328" offset="4885251">So what would really be needed is a very close analysis of the marriages of all insurance beneficiaries to determine who is needy and who is not and presumably that inquiry would call for that determination, would call for a close detail month by month inquiry into eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.044" offset="4960065">Moreover, this Title II would have to be further altered to pay these persons on the basis of these individualized determinations of need and as I have explained today and as we have explained at length in our brief, Title II is simply not setup for that purpose and the constitution does not require that it be altered to accommodate that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.591" offset="5038328">Instead, without working such a drastic change in Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.597" offset="5054315">Congress instead has designed general assistance programs to work in-tandem with the insurance provisions of the Act, by providing that further relief of need that is not covered by insurance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.561" offset="5110217">Here in particular under the supplemental security income program provided for in sections of the Title XVI of the Act, benefits are allocated on a basis of an individual's need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.108" offset="5156402">Appellee's case rest, ultimately on the fact that he is a needy person but the Supplemental Security Income Program has taken up where Title II has left off in providing the appellee with the form of federal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.657" offset="5214498">I think when seen in this context, there can be a little doubt that appellee has been treated rationally by the social security program and that the Title II provisions at issue in this case are constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.972" offset="6579762">I represent John Jobst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.912" offset="6587598">Mr. Jobst maintains that the decision of the District Court on remand should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.824" offset="6627200">I think that at the beginning there are certain things we want to emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.679" offset="6650606">Number one the holding of the District Court is a very narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.253" offset="6684983">It is to the effect that 202(d) puts child's insurance beneficiaries who are disabled into two classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.287" offset="6737019">One class of totally disabled recipients who marry other totally recipients and continue to receive social security benefits, and a second class which marries totally disabled non-recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.412" offset="6829597">In this case, a recipient of welfare benefits and for this reason alone, perpetually, loses his right to lifetime social security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.249" offset="6888947">As was admitted by appellant, this termination is perpetual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.413" offset="6917577">Mr. Jobst therefore by the statute is relegated to a lifetime of receipt of welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.396" offset="6957492">This is a case regardless of whether you call it a supplemental security income or whether it is federally assisted, welfare disability benefits under Statute's of the State of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.931" offset="7019664">It is still welfare, its still need based.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.489" offset="7025829">Mr. Riffel could I interrupt you, is it really quite correct to say that the statute makes the classification you describe, there is nothing in the statute that places people who marry totally disabled non-recipients in a special category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.547" offset="7086119">It’s a broader category of which they are a part.</text>

            <text syncTime="1754.183" offset="7096673">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.737" offset="7098867">I think, that the statute can be read to do specifically that as was read by Judge Oliver in section 202(d)(5)(B), capital B I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.190" offset="7156650">It specifically speaks of disabled child recipients who do marry other disabled child recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.701" offset="7198759">So under that specific provision, I think the holding of the Court could be very narrowly limited to that Section B and perhaps the constitutionality of Section A which refers to general marriages to, like someone receiving old age benefits could be left alone, that would be one possibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.258" offset="7360927">It’s these people who marry anyone who is not receiving benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.919" offset="7427592">The statutory scheme as I hold generally provides that anyone who marries another recipient who is eligible under that statute continues to receive benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.162" offset="7468552">All I am saying is there a narrow provision which I think is what District Court was looking at in this specific case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.218" offset="7636781">Now another point, we want to emphasize is that there is a substantial difference in benefits at the time of the remand of this case, there was considerable disagreement between the Government's position and our position, as to just what affect SSI and self security benefits had, as compared to one another on level of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.719" offset="7750779">The Government chose to compare that as to the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.972" offset="7767811">Mr. Jobst, the dependent of an insured wage earner, however, admittedly was receiving far less than he would have, had he been a Social security recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.015" offset="7815981">The reason for this is that SSI is based on need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.699" offset="7838759">That is for every $2 earned above $80, the benefits are reduced by a total of $1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.369" offset="7877421">Under a Social security, Mr. Jobst's assets are unlimited; he could become a millionaire by a windfall and still receive benefits under SSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.447" offset="7933741">At the most Mr. Jobst can have an assets is $2,250 and remain eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.948" offset="7967700">Another important point is that Congress has in fact discriminated as to level of benefits between social security and supplemental security income from a historical perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.229" offset="8024856">This is clearly shown by the fact that at the time of remand, and the entry of the stipulation which was the record on remand in this case, there was a difference of some $9,000 in the level of benefits received by Mr. Jobst as compared to what he would have received, had he continued receiving social security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.475" offset="8117852">I also want to emphasize that even had Mr. Jobst remained married which he did not, his marriage is now been dissolved, he has no further relationship to Sandra Jobst, he is now living alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.189" offset="8176679">Even had he remained married then an amount of $20 which it was at that time for a month for a person or family with an income so low, can be a huge amount of money to that family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.398" offset="8249509">Now just what did the District Court do, I do not think it was a very strange holding, I do not think the Court deviated in any way from any current standard established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.599" offset="8314292">Rather I think that Court was looking to the central question under the Social Security Act, that question being, was that person dependent?</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.376" offset="8369463">Did he remain dependent on the insured wage earner?</text>

            <text syncTime="2884.418" offset="11617633">In that event, it obviously could be applied under other situation, but I do think that the situation is such that it could be a narrow holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.250" offset="11672908">I think someone else is going to come along and say it applies to my situation, I do not think there is any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.798" offset="11727138">The child insurance provisions then are a mere restatement of the general purposes of social security benefits and that is to provide a continuing income to the insured worker and his dependence in the event of disability, retirement, or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.031" offset="11828075">In this case, the secretary has placed great reliance on the premise that to promote administrative ease, administration of social security benefit, this Court should not look at this provision, should not question its constitutionality because this provision is necessary to ease the administration of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.784" offset="11955030">Under our view, when compared with recent decisions of this case, this is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.731" offset="11986795">There are, I am sure, certain presumptions which could be established properly under this act to determine whether Mr. Jobst in fact, does still need social security benefits as a dependent of an insured worker, but this is not a proper classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.176" offset="12068611">For example, in the case of Weinberger vs. Salfi, this Court examined a nine-month duration of limitation statute which, in fact, an affect provided that a survivor and the children of that person of an insured worker must wait nine months following the date of the marriage in order to be eligible for secondary benefits as the survivors of the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.149" offset="12208523">The Court looked at that duration requirement and compared it to the purposes of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.699" offset="12254707">What the Court stated was that those purposes were related to the dependency of the insured wage earner that the classifications established must be measured against the dependency of the insured wage earner established which was reflected by the classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.276" offset="12365048">Now in that case, in the Salfi case, it was clear one that Congress had stated a real concerned over false claims for benefits where individuals would marry sick insured workers, simply because they knew that person soon would be disabled, die, or retire and therefore enabled themselves to lifetime social security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.694" offset="12498691">This is not the case with child's insurance benefits. Congress has specifically examined this question, it is stated in the legislative history that one, they need not be concerned with determinations of disability as they were in the case of the other disability provisions for insured workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.256" offset="12600986">The reason being one, this is a small class of people, it is not very many disabled children entitled to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.529" offset="12638080">Secondly, because of congenital problems and so forth, in most cases, the disability will be very apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.479" offset="12681861">Now when we compare this with the Salfi case, this is a quite different situation which the Court is faced with than in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.099" offset="12728359">There is also the further consideration that the standards of disability must have been very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.768" offset="12758975">Disability benefits under welfare statutes have been controlled by federal regulations under the Social Security Act for a long time, a long time before the enactment of Supplemental Security Income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.781" offset="12811011">Under the Supplemental Security Income program now, again the Social Security administration has access to information on those disability benefits and there is a further reason that under the narrow holding of this Court as to other disabled children under Section B, in most cases that disability is going to be readily apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.447" offset="12917695">For example, in this case, she was a victim of cerebral palsy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.593" offset="12934309">She has been disabled from birth as the record reflects and as the Social Security administration admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.711" offset="12974746">Under an old line of reasoning going to back to Dandridge, this classification simply is not rationally based on examination of more recent cases of this Court, Jimenez vs. Weinberger and Mathews vs. Lucas, this discrimination becomes apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.698" offset="13062727">This discrimination under Jimenez vs. Weinberger is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.974" offset="13091775">In the Jimenez case, this Court examined a presumption in the Social Security legislation which required some illegitimate -- which denied illegitimate children, some illegitimate children benefits under the Social Security Act, while other Illegitimate children and legitimate children under that act were entitled to a presumption of eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.946" offset="13199713">I think this case was the origin of the over-inclusive, under-inclusive language which has sometimes been referred to by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.443" offset="13237643">At any rate under the Jimenez opinion, this Court reversed a lower court decision which had stated that this presumption was alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.626" offset="13294381">Since it was intended to avoid various claims and this Court clearly said, it is not as described by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.306" offset="13321130">Why, because it is irrational, because it is invidious, because the Fifth Amendment has teeth, because sometimes the government, maybe not intentionally, I am sure not with an intent, no one sat down and said, we are going to nail John Jobst, this guy ought to receive welfare, but nevertheless by affect that discrimination is invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.033" offset="13428023">It is not rationally related.</text>

            <text syncTime="3420.659" offset="13762599">If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, two very short points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.144" offset="13776496">First, I would like to confirm that Mr. Justice Stevens, your understanding of the act with regard to other secondary insurance beneficiaries is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.682" offset="13810665">For example, take a widower, those provisions provide with section 202 (f) that if the widower marries, the secondary insurance benefits are terminated but then there is savings provision in 202(f)(4) for when the insurance beneficiary marries someone else who is entitled to insurance benefits under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.992" offset="13887883">So contrary to appellee's protestations about how narrow this case is, I think a principle of broad application is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.233" offset="13924872">Indeed I think it is broader than that because the Court's rational -- the District Court's rational carry to its logical extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.973" offset="13951830">As I mentioned in my argument, I think would require Congress to attack a needs test under all terminating events.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.374" offset="13973460">Events such as non-disabled children reaching age 18, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.345" offset="13997283">It is true that there is not a congruence between the District Court's judgment and its rational.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.290" offset="14017032">Let me just be sure I understand what you are saying because it is of some importance to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.881" offset="14031452">You are saying that the prior to 1958, there was flat termination when there was marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.534" offset="14050051">After 1958, there is a broad classification in the two -- two broad categories rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.416" offset="14077636">One is persons who marry other persons who are covered, and the other classification is persons that is secondary beneficiaries, who marry persons who are not covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.176" offset="14132598">I notice in that event, actually when you have a marriage between two covered persons if you did not have the 1958 Amendment, two people would be affected by the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.668" offset="14166557">As I said, it would cause a simultaneous termination of both of their benefits and that was the hardship the Congress was concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.538" offset="14190067">Also to clarify appellee mentioned that there was a $9000 difference in the payments, that is covered in the stipulation of that page 15 of our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.313" offset="14229146">The $9000 reflects the amount of secondary child insurance benefits that would have been paid, have these benefits not been discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.888" offset="14267494">The secretary maintains if that money had been paid, he would be entitled to recoup as overpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.649" offset="14290482">The amount of SSI benefits that has been paid, that is approximately $3000 and the reason it is so low is that from 1971, appellee married, till 1974 there were no SSI benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.840" offset="14339278">Appellee was receiving state welfare insurance but not SSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.962" offset="14355788">For the reason stated in an our brief then and we respectfully urge that the judgment of the District Court be reserved.</text>
