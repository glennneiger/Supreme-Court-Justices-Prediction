            <text syncTime="21.585" offset="166283">I wish to bring the attention of the Court to a small factual matter which came to my attention yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.349" offset="193345">You mentioned 36 trading suspension orders and the source of this is because on Page 122 of the Appendix, there is a list of orders and there was a typographical error and that the SEC when they copied my original petition left out, the December 25, 1975 order.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="48.758" offset="274952">The question I think Mr. Sloan was a purely hypothetical right, asking whether if 36 consecutive 10-day orders were entered.</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_h_sloan" startTime="56.713" stopTime="64.096">
            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="56.713" offset="306821">Yes, but I did discover that there are 36 listed here and in fact they were 37, because there is a typographical error in their Appendix.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="64.096" offset="336287">But my hypothetical was deliberate in one last order to make it hypothetical.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="69.795" offset="359066">Okay, for whatever reason I did notice that -- in the original record, I do have the December 25 date in my petition I were to file to the Court of Appeals which has been transmitted to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.129" offset="420402">However, on the subject of the record I also wish to bring to the attention of this Court the fact that the SEC has refused to permit the record as it was, in the State it was, before the Court of Appeals to be transmitted to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.120" offset="492395">I mentioned this in my brief, and it is now a matter which is pending before the Court of Appeals because I filed a motion in the Court of Appeals to require that the SEC to certify the full record to the Court of Appeals and that matter is now pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.275" offset="565016">I have also explained what happened in some detail in a letter which I wrote to this Court, but he has advised me that he will not distribute it at this late date.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.413" offset="609528">What essentially happened was that after the Court of Appeals made its decision, the Court of Appeals sent the record back to the SEC which is its normal practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.739" offset="646831">When this Court granted certiorari, the SEC was directed or requested to send the record back to the Court of Appeals, so it could be transmitted to this Court, but what it did, was it switched the record, so that the record that was sent back to the Court of Appeals was not the record, which the Court of Appeals had returned to the SEC and the Court of Appeals does not appraise to this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.784" offset="731050">So that the record which this Court has consist of memorandums dealing with trading suspension orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.023" offset="759994">I have no objection to this Court reading these memorandums, but the fact remains that they were not filed in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.302" offset="793117">All that was filed in the Court of Appeals was a certified list.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.257" offset="804924">The record which has not been transmitted to this Court, concerns the record of the administrative proceedings against me which was a part of the record in the consolidated case when these two cases were before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.827" offset="859259">The SEC says that that record is not pertinent to the issues involved in this appeal and therefore they will not transmit that record to the Court of Appeals for certification to this Court, even though they have been requested by the Court to the Court of Appeals to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.061" offset="916206">So right now we have a situation because I happen to feel that that record is pertinent to the question of mootness which the SEC has raised particularly with regard to certain points which were discussed yesterday.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.836" offset="971272">Well, the SEC has always said that this case was moot right from the very beginning.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.373" offset="1001365">Oh! Yes, they did, but the SEC was briefing the question of mootness already.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.905" offset="1015576">Now this Court to the case of Weinstein versus Bradford, for example, which was discussed yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.388" offset="1045460">It is true that the trading suspension orders have expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.826" offset="1063223">However, at the present time there is an order currently outstanding which is a lifetime bar against me from being associated with the securities dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.518" offset="1093943">I believe that I can show through the record which the SEC has refused to transmit that this lifetime bar was based in part on successive trading suspension orders which the Court of Appeals declared to be illegal.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.014" offset="1207941">The decision in the Court of Appeals discussed two different cases, but they were consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.132" offset="1228421">This Court when it granted certiorari only agreed to review the issues pertaining to one of the cases, but nevertheless I claimed that the record of both cases, since it was a consolidated case, it should be here, and I should be allowed to cite documents in the record of the other case which I think demonstrate that this case is not moot in my presentation.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="303.895" offset="1295504">Is it your contention then Mr. Sloan that the SEC relied on a number of factors in issuing its lifetime bar order against you and one of them was this 10-day order and therefore it is at least conceivable that if this 10-day order were found to be invalid they might not have entered the same lifetime bar order against you?</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="328.044" offset="1392052">Yes, what my contention is precisely is that the SEC when they issued successive 10-day suspension orders, deducted from my net capital certain securities which were it failed to deliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.712" offset="1434789">Then they found me retroactively in violation to the Net Capital Rule, and on the basis of these findings that was in violation in Net Capital Rule, they then barred me from the securities business.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.951" offset="1475749">If these 10-day suspension orders were illegal on the first place, I would say that they cannot rely on them to make net capital deductions and therefore the order which barred me for life in the securities business, is invalid.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="362.520" offset="1529979">What is the tie in between the 10-day suspension and the net capital deduction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_h_sloan" startTime="368.546" stopTime="422.728">
            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="368.546" offset="1554116">Yes, because the SEC has released Securities Exchange Act release 10209, which states that if a broker is short a security which is suspended from trading by the SEC, he is required to deduct from his net capital the fails to deliver in suspended securities, and I in fact was short at the time in the successive suspension order at a number of occasions, and they deducted the fails to deliver in suspended securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.796" offset="1663099">Therefore it seems to me reasonable that if those orders were illegal they cannot rely on them to bar me from the securities business.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.823" offset="1699252">I have not reached that point in this case, I do not know if this Court affirms the decision it may be that there would be further proceedings and I lose on that particular point, but it seems to me that I have the right to make this showing that they did in fact rely on successive trading suspension orders to bar me from the securities business.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.276" offset="2204983">Now, I will point it out that because of the continuing policy of the SEC, this case has been going on for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.170" offset="2240614">The specific orders which the Court of Appeals vacated were not themselves used by the SEC as a basis because by the time, this case got in the Court -- this is a third suit I brought -- by the time this case got before the Court of Appeals, it was too late to challenge those suspension orders because there is a 60-day limitation in Section 25 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.110" offset="2324310">Nevertheless the decision of the Court of Appeals makes it clear, I now believe, that if you will affirm that decision it will be cleared that all these were illegal that they have been issuing over the past 33 years, and this would give me a basis for going back to the Securities and Exchange Commission and asking them to reopen the procedure.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="680.484" offset="2801829">Now, in the -- yesterday the SEC gave three reasons for the trading suspension and they said that this suspension was of this length because there were three different things going on and this is the reason why they had let it for so long, and one was - market manipulation, two was - a change in management, three was - a late 10 (k) filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.933" offset="2883644">I want to address the facts which are in the record with regard to these three merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.652" offset="2906527">The change in management took place at a meeting of the Board of Directors of Canadian Javelin Ltd on March 06, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.286" offset="2933068">At that time a group headed by William Wismer throughout the Doyle Group, throughout the management of Canadian Javelin Ltd., fired Mr. Doyle personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.245" offset="2968908">This is reflected in the March 26 memo which is on Page 104-105 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.857" offset="2995344">The 10 (k) delinquency which is another reason cited by the SEC occurred on March 31, 1976 and this can be seen from Page 110 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.875" offset="3031393">So prior to March 6, there were 32 suspension orders, prior to March 31, there were 34 suspension orders, this means that the SEC suspended trading for 31 times because of the market manipulation, for two more times because of the change in management, and for another three times because of the lateness in the 10 (k) filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.081" offset="3124284">The SEC also referred to a fugitive from Justice yesterday in the argument that they presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.002" offset="3151974">However, on March 6, 1976 Mr. Doyle who is a notorious fugitive from Justice, who they are referring to, was thrown out of the company, he was fired personally, and the SEC claims that they suspended trading for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.929" offset="3211638">On July 30, 1976, after the suspension was listed, there was a court order to special meeting of directors, special meeting of stockholder, which I intended, in Montreal which is also discussed in the record because a copy of the Judge's order is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.354" offset="3273287">Holding a special action and at that point Doyle got back into management and through the Wismer Group out.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.197" offset="3300663">So, now we have a situation where an individual, a Toronto attorney became the President of Canadian Javelin Ltd.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.958" offset="3339742">At that point the SEC says, it suspends trading; three months later when the fugitive from Justice gets back and control over the company, they do not suspend trading and I point this out because I think this demonstrate really that reason that it is a fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.764" offset="3411004">In addition to that Mr. Justice Powell yesterday raised the question of whether a cooperation has the right to protest, to come in and ask for hearing to protest a trading suspension?</text>
            <text syncTime="846.578" offset="3466279">Ironically it is reported in the Wall Street Journal that at the time of May 02, 1976 lifting the trading suspension management of Canadian Javelin Ltd petitioned the SEC to continue the trading suspension, and incidentally also, the earlier trading suspension which was terminated in January 1975, the management of Canadian Javelin again requested, a different management requested that the SEC continued a trading suspension and filed a motion and obtained the stay in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.304" offset="3609117">This illustrates a point that very often the cooperation itself does not want a trading suspension, even though it is to the detriment of its own stockholders, because the corporate management for their own personal reasons may desire that trading not take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.139" offset="3672438">Now in the matter of the 10 (k), this 10 (k) report became delinquent on March 31, 1976, as the records state.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.571" offset="3718204">I have not known of any case the SEC often suspends its trading because 10 (k) delinquency, but they do not suspend on the day that the 10 (k) became delinquent, and they do not suspend even two months later because the trading suspension here was lifted on May 02.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.268" offset="4785045">The Commission has had the power since 1934 to suspend the registration of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.200" offset="4808764">Now when they enacted 12 (j), they included a sentence which, in addition to renumbering, they include a sense which said that would be illegal for a broker, or dealer to buy or sell or to use the means of instrumentalities of interstate commerce to affect a transaction in the security whose registration has been suspended or revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.601" offset="4898312">So that this makes it clear, although it was clear already that the SEC could after notice and a hearing suspend the registration which would also suspend the trading in the security under Section 12 (j), but they have always had this power since 1934.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.328" offset="5013251">I would like to point out that in this particular case, the SEC suspended trading for 370 days, which is more than one year therefore they actually suspended trading for more time under Section 12 (k) without noticing the opportunity for hearing then they were permitted to suspend with notice and the opportunity for hearing under Section 12 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.746" offset="5094857">So what they are saying is that they can suspend trading for a longer period of time without notice, indicating with notice, and I am sure that this could not possibly be what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.719" offset="5134772">Now, also yesterday Mr. Justice Powell asked whether the rollover proceedings are ex parte?</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.433" offset="5173643">And of course of Commission says that this is not a rubber stamp procedure and the Commission very seriously considers the needs of investors and this of thing, but again although I do not want to go into the same track that I may have fallen and just a second ago, I think that the record demonstrates that the Commission not only is in the rubber stamp proceeding, but the Commission itself plays no part in the decision to suspend in this record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.088" offset="5316271">The first trading suspension is dated April 29, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.869" offset="5335393">The memorandum which they have submitted as to record of this trading suspension is a memorandum by the staff, dated May 02, 1975, three days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.956" offset="5379696">So that it is clear this is not a memorandum from the Commission, this is a memorandum from the staff and it explains the reasons for the trading suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.692" offset="5410730">From this it is clear that the Commissioners themselves could not have received this memorandum at the time trading was suspended, and in fact since the suspension orders are not signed by the Commissioners, they do not bear the Commissioners' names, and we do not even know if the Commissioner is new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.047" offset="5480111">The Commissioners may have been on vacation at some place, we do not even know that they were in Washington at the time, they therefore did not participate and perhaps they were read in newspaper said trading have been suspended in Canadian Javelin Ltd., but this is really about all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.364" offset="5545417">It is quite clear that the Secretary of Commission is performing the ministerial task apparently at the direction of members of the staff and the Commissioners themselves are not involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.967" offset="5747814">And all of the trades alleged here are could on the Montreal or Vancouver stock exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.553" offset="5770175">Now, in a hypothetical situation of what if there is a market manipulation, I would say that a trading suspension order which holds trading for ten days is sufficient to bring to an end any market manipulation, because usually our market manipulators, they rely on certain things to keep the price up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.964" offset="5835794">They have the park securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1508.671" offset="6114573">Congress has given them Section 12 (j) and it stated in the Senate Report 1975 that this was intended to be exercised when they wanted to suspend trading for a period of extended duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.403" offset="6169535">Now they say this is insufficient because many companies are not registered because they do not have as much as a million dollars in assets, and 500 stockholders which is required by Section 12 (g) of the Securities and Exchange Act.</text>
