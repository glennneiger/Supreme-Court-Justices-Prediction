            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79993">We will hear argument first this morning in number 1650, Ohralik against the Ohio State Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.674" offset="130671">Mr. Gressman you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="16.933" offset="147702">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.480" offset="161913">This case is here on appeal from Supreme Court of Ohio, which ordered that the appellant Albert Ohralik be suspended indefinitely from the practice of the law in Ohio on the ground that he did solicit and obtain retainer agreements from two accident victims in violation of two sections of Disciplinary Code of Professional Responsibility, numbers 103 (A) and 104 (A) under canon 2 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.030" offset="336097">Now it is important to understanding the sole and the critical issue now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.357" offset="389387">To understand that there was a single unitary charge and finding with respect to the activities of this appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.529" offset="442050">The charge was that he did solicit and did obtain agreements from these two individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.898" offset="479562">The finding was that he did solicit and did obtain agreements from these two individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.991" offset="511954">This fall squarely without more within the ambient of these two disciplinary rules, which in affect prohibit a lawyer from recommending his own employment or accepting employment from a layman, who has not sought his advise regarding the employment of an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.071" offset="620205">So that based upon that simple determination, the Federal constitutional issue was premised and raised in the court below and it has being accepted for review by this Court to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.966" offset="699826">Does the First Amendment entitle a lawyer to recommend his own employment or to accept employment in the context, the simple context of giving unsolicited advice, respecting the need for counsel and respecting the desirability of taking legal action, which the perspective client may be ignored.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="191.328" offset="845276">Well, does the charge require proof of advice with respect to need for counsel?</text>

          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="201.005" stopTime="204.373">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="201.005" offset="883937">That is the way in which the Disciplinary Rule reads.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="204.373" stopTime="215.202">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="204.373" offset="897417">So that just is not the business of soliciting business, it also says you should have a lawyer.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="215.202" stopTime="223.385">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="215.202" offset="940780">That is true that is essentially -- it is combination I would suspect of giving legal advice about the need.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="223.385" stopTime="224.638">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="223.385" offset="973485">The need and then recommending himself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="224.638" stopTime="366.075">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="224.638" offset="978501">And recommending himself, and in the context of course, of a situation where that person does not come to the lawyer seeking such advice and recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.687" offset="1038687">Now in this limited context, I think, our first point has to be an understanding, of just what are the basic elements of this kind of solicitation of legal business.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.750" offset="1118935">As I view it, reading the text of these disciplinary rules, the elements are first a truthful conveying of information concerning the person's possible legal rights and conveying of truthful information concerning his need for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.918" offset="1235650">Second element that the lawyer speaks with a commercial or profit seeking element in mind, he is soliciting business for the sake of his personal pecuniary gain, as most lawyers do practice law for pecuniary gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.337" offset="1333244">Thirdly, like many commercial solicitations, this one may be and is designed to be the most persuasive in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.766" offset="1391026">And fourth, the element that is already been mentioned that ordinarily according to the rule, this kind of conveying of information and solicitation is in the context of proffering unsolicited legal advice and conveying the need for counsel, competent counsel who represent the individual in pursuit of what may be his legal rights.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="366.075" stopTime="391.726">

            <text syncTime="366.075" offset="1544209">Do you think counsel it would be fundamentally any different if a physician observing some person stranger to him thought he detected symptoms of diabetes or any other disease superficial symptoms and then solicited the person to come to his office for an examination.</text>

          <turn speaker="eugene_gressman" startTime="391.726" stopTime="424.364">

            <text syncTime="399.528" offset="1678060">Well, I am not sure that doctors have ever aggressively sought the medical practice in that manner and all the -- basically that would be essentially the same situation, I would agree.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene Gressman</label>
            <text syncTime="428.354" offset="1793312">Well if they do, I would say that it is essentially the same situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.892" offset="1827480">I suppose there are many doctors who may, in the company of their friends, notice a medical problem that might encourage him to do exactly what the Chief Justice suggest that he come in for an examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.896" offset="1895503">That may be done informally or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.918" offset="1911595">Well if this is done to some extent in various areas, it would be at least indicated by the fact that hospitals have committees of surgeons to monitor surgery to see whether unnecessary surgery is being performed, do they not?</text>

            <text syncTime="498.477" offset="2073867">Yes, I suppose in the medical field you get more of that in the organizational areas and that individuals are -- doctors are not as many in number compared to the types of organizations that would, you might say, solicit medical treatment by unsuspecting victims of some defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.659" offset="2198628">Now, in a real sense, therefore, it seems to me that the action, the context in which this commercialized solicitation does occur to with that freely giving a legal advice and recommendation of attorneys is really in the highest tradition of the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.737" offset="2306880">This may not be an ideal way of obtaining a legal business but then and certainly is not the only way, but the freedom the circumstance of discussing, conveying legal information and advice to those most in need of is a situation that I think warrants commendation rather than condemnation, and leads to my next point, as to what it is about this kind of solicitation that has encouraged the wrath and the prohibition by the organized bar of this solicitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.253" offset="6224933">There are two lines of cases that I think justify the conclusion that this is protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.583" offset="6266311">The first line of cases of course starts with NAACP versus Button, and indeed this Court held in Button that solicitation is not wholly outside the area of freedom protected by the First Amendment, and that First Amendment cannot be ignored under the guys (ph) of prohibiting professional misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.244" offset="6380937">Now that is almost the complete answer to this constitutional question posed to you in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.472" offset="6413851">There has to be, under that formulation of constitutional doctrine in the Button case, there has to be an area of freedom to solicit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.305" offset="6873188">Well, in one of these cases, I think it was the United Mine Workers case, and the Court was dealing in all of these case both with the organization and with the individual attorneys, some of whom had been charged, I assume, with the violations of the Professional Code of Ethics, but in the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen at 337 U.S. at Page 8, the Court made this rather significant comment - and this was a unanimous opinion as I recall, Mr. Justice Black writing that “Lawyers accepting employment is where retainer agreements that had been solicited, accepting employment under this constitutionally protected plan, have a like protection which the state cannot abridge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.142" offset="7124486">Now it seems to me that this Court was there indicating that there was the area of First Amendment freedom to solicit that the State cannot protect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.969" offset="7287804">And what is significant about these notions as Mr. Justice White indicated, the attempted justifications for the ban on solicitation all relate to projected fear that there is something inherently going to and inescapably going to happen when the lawyer confronts a prospective client that, that lawyer can not be trusted to do anything other than to misrepresent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.422" offset="8609600">There are some misimpressions that may began from what it said in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.093" offset="8632274">First, the Supreme Court of Ohio has sole and exclusive jurisdiction as to what are the facts in a disciplinary matter and what the discipline should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.136" offset="8688489">When a complaint is filed against an attorney such as Mr. Ohralik, it is heard by a Board of Commissioners, a panel of three of the Board of Commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.730" offset="8734883">And they made findings of fact and sent it on to the full Board of Commissioners who themselves review the record and make findings of fact and recommendations to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.709" offset="8786814">After that proceeding is finished that they lose jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.970" offset="8807817">What they find as fact and what they recommend has no varying whatsoever from thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.010" offset="8840000">It is for the guidance of the Supreme Court of Ohio, of course, but the Supreme Court of Ohio, and I repeat has, sole and exclusive jurisdiction as to what the findings of fact are and as to what the discipline should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.574" offset="8894230">So where it is referred to in the brief that the - in appellant's brief - that the Board of Commissioners made certain findings with respect to the relinquishment of the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.201" offset="8952744">They found that that was not unethical for appellant to claim to his contracts; there was no finding on that matter by the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.636" offset="10090533">This is the same as in this case is indicated by the findings of the court below, they made a number of findings that would not be specifically charged in the complaint, but the evidence indicates that these things did occur such as a suit after against Carol McClintock after the solicitation had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.927" offset="10183634">The court makes a specific finding on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.148" offset="10192515">And it makes specific findings with respect to the fact that Wanda Lou Holbert discharged the appellant after she had time to reflect upon the matter overnight and had a talk with her mother about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.251" offset="10264927">That is after the solicitation so of course is our position and that is incorporated in the general charge although the charge is specific as to time and place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.102" offset="10336398">In essence, appellant is arguing here, as I understand it and as I understand his brief, that there is need for some State regulation of a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.940" offset="10395748">Nevertheless he says that the Ohio rules are overbroad and inhibit objectionable as well as unobjectionable conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.862" offset="10439425">He also argues that appellant's conduct was unobjectionable, innocent, pure, benign perhaps other labels he puts on the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.644" offset="10498566">However, it is -- he also argues that there is no harm done to the clients in this case and that there is no stated compelling interest by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.170" offset="10572649">It is our position that the record plainly demonstrates that the appellant's conduct poses precisely the dangers that support the Ohio rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.813" offset="10635239">It is clear, we believe, we submit, that the purpose of the Disciplinary Rules DR2-103(A) and DR2-104(A) are to eliminate or at least to reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the injury to potential clients that is caused by solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.922" offset="10743595">In other words, the rules have, as a purpose, the protection of the public from the harm and the dangers of harm flow from commercial solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.149" offset="10796571">Furthermore, it is, as I have indicated, the public policy of Ohio's expressed through as General Assembly that commercial solicitation is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.449" offset="10857697">Secondly, even if we -- if there are some conceivable situations that the rules challenged by appellant maybe deemed to be overbroad, the appellant should not be permitted to evade himself of the overbreadth doctrine as expressed in Bates to secure reversal of the judgment of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.819" offset="10983190">In Bates, this Court held that the justification for the overbreadth analysis applies weekly, if at all, in the ordinary commercial context and the client to apply it to professional advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.047" offset="11056124">A context where the Court said it is not necessary to further its intended objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.885" offset="11079529">The Court said since advertising is linked to commercial well being, it seem unlikely that such speech is particularly susceptible to be in crushed by overbroad regulations, and since solicitation is similarly linked to commercial well being and is a practice that is no more deserving a First Amendment protection than commercial advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.088" offset="11204290">We submit that the appellant should not be able to evade himself of the overbreadth doctrine.</text>
