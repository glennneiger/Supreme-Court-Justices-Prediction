            <label>Mr. John Undem Carlson</label>
            <text syncTime="10.129" offset="120422">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.370" offset="133378">My name is John Carlson of Denver, Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.970" offset="147798">I am here on behalf of the Twin Lakes Reservoir and Canal Company, a Colorado mutual ditch company.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.075" offset="172248">We are an amicus in this case and the State of New Mexico has graciously allowed us to argue, because we represent the classic beneficiary for whom the National Forest was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.681" offset="222613">We have a large for Colorado, small for the National Forest perhaps, diversion project located on the very headwaters of the National Forest Rivers in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.963" offset="271827">It is on the headwaters of the Colorado River, the Roaring Fork to be particular, some 17 miles above Aspen, Colorado, a watering spot some of you may know.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.361" offset="313414">That diversion project intersects and gathers water from scores of small streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.854" offset="351344">We do not have anything like the Patomic River out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.808" offset="363151">We have streams, some of them when they are in full state of flood, are much like suburban lawn sprinkler.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.110" offset="400350">We intercept all of these as they go across our canal, and deliver the water into a tunnel that carries forest water from the Whiter River National Forest, over in to the Arkansas River Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.353" offset="461372">That system was constructed first in 1930, and it continuously has diverted water with the aid and encouragement of the forest service until very recent times.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.257" offset="516960">We think we are a representative of the class for which the National Forest were created, because Congress said when they passed the Organic Act in 1897, that the purpose of the forest was to secure favorable conditions of flows.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.813" offset="591148">Now, when they said favorable conditions of flows, they were not saying, “flows for flows sake,” they said “We want to provide water for the people of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.554" offset="630123">We want to cause there to be an availability of water, so that the people who are settling in the west, can construct a civilization, we have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.784" offset="671083">The forest service apparently does not like it today, but it exists and it is there, and we are trying to protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.828" offset="703266">The importance of this case cannot be underestimated, when you recognize that in the State of Colorado, 98% of the water that arises in the whole state and flows through the streams of that state, arise on the public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.700" offset="778707">Of that 98% of the water flowing on the public lands and through our streams, 95% of it comes from the National Forests, so there is not any water in Colorado, except what occurs on the National Forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.686" offset="834714">That statistic is contained in a Congressional document called The Study and Development Management and Use of Water Resources on Public Lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.480" offset="869822">It was prepared for the Public Land Law Review Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.169" offset="880585">It is contained in table 5 of the weekly report.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="204.513" offset="898035">I suppose that would probably be true of most of the other area of the states of the western to greater or lesser degrees since the forest themselves occur at the higher levels?</text>

            <text syncTime="216.151" offset="944533">New Mexico’s particular statistic is 62%, Arizona’s, Nevada’s, and Utah’s are up in the 90% as I recall, but that illustrates the importance of the case because we do not have any water in our streams except what originates out of these snow pack that falls in the high mountain country.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.740" offset="1030841">And when Congress passed this Act back in the 1890’s, they were not dummies.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.026" offset="1048082">They knew that the west depended on snow packs in the high mountain country.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.414" offset="1065636">If you retarded the rate of runoff in that high mountain country you would cause a greater sustained rate of delivery of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.994" offset="1115896">Now, they thought that it was important to deliver water to people for economic utilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.032" offset="1140033">There is not one shred of evidence in the statute or in a legislative history or in 60 years of administrative construction that anyone thought that Organic Act of 1897 created a reserved water right for the purposes now claimed by the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.565" offset="1286214">We think that to the extent, the forest administrators have a bona fide need for water for something that falls within the 2 fundamental overwhelming purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.206" offset="1392794">For example, if they locate a district headquarters, and employ 5000 people in it, in order to run and administer the forest, and they located it on forest land, we would concede and grant them a water right to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.034" offset="6016049">I would like to make another point if I may in brief time, which is that New Mexico and the amicus have suggested that the sole reason of the State Courts denied rights to “instream flows” was because we failed to prove any need for those rights, and we believe this misreads the State rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.135" offset="6100477">The State Courts did not deny the US minimum “instream flows” because of any failure of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.057" offset="6124196">Quite to the contrary, they stated this flatly and unequivocally as could be done that we were not entitled to any minimum “instream flow” as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.224" offset="6160872">The state district court wrote that the United States does not have reserved rights to minimum “instream flows” based upon the purposes for which the Gila forest lands were or could have been withdrawn from the public domain and the Supreme Court affirms stating that “instream flows” were not contemplated by the Organic Act and I refer the Court to Appendix 231 and page 241 and as a last word, I will simply say that we requested permission to present additional evidence after the state objected to the in-stream after the evidence closed and we were denied that right.</text>
