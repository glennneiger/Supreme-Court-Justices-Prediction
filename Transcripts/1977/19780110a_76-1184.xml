            <label>Mr. Richard B. Allyn</label>
            <text syncTime="73.813" offset="375173">Mr. Allyn is just fine Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.535" offset="382069">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court and counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.573" offset="406206">White Motor today asked you do apply your doctrine of labor law preemption to strike down a state’s statute, a statute which you have given affect would to some large extent, make sure that about 1200 or so retirees of a plant that has been shut down get their pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.475" offset="489798">Now, we believe our statute should not be preempted for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.248" offset="508920">First of all, Congress has specifically empowered the State to regulate in the area of pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.860" offset="547372">Secondly, we believe if you apply your standard and traditional case analysis where Congress is silent that our statute will pass muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.639" offset="586451">And, finally, we believe that this limited statute falls within that area where the states may regulate under their police power to look out for the health and welfare of their citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.318" offset="633158">Mr. Chief Justice, I have exceeded 10 minutes of my argument to counsel for the United States who will address especially this last issue and I will try to make sure I watch my clock accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.278" offset="681014">This case is commenced in federal court up at Minnesota in front of Judge Olsap in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.561" offset="706196">He ruled that the state’s statute was not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.316" offset="725213">The three-judge panels, Eight Circuit disagreed and that is why we are here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.897" offset="743499">If I may say at the outset, it seems to me that the issue before you today is whether or not a state can regulate pension plans so as to ensure that retiring workers get their primus pensions not withstanding that the regulation disregards a provision of collectively bargained pension plan which would permit an employer to escape its pension liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.701" offset="838689">Well you would not be making that argument if the federal law had clearly said that the states could not pass this certain law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Allyn</label>
            <text syncTime="205.163" offset="900547">Those issues are not here today, question to due process, contract clause and so on and so forth, are still down below, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.086" offset="928237">Although, a companion case that is pending before you for consideration on whether or not to take jurisdiction did pass upon constitutional issues other than preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.864" offset="971391">That is called the Fleck v. Spannaus and in that case the three-judge panel ruled that the statute did pass constitutional muster under these other theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.050" offset="1016113">I would like to describe for you briefly, but can the act it is here under attack, It is called the Minnesota Private Pension Benefit Protection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.736" offset="1050908">I am going to call it the Pension Act for short.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.194" offset="1060730">It was adopted in April of 1974 by the Minnesota legislature about 4-and-a-half months before FERISA was adopted, the Federal Employees Retirement Income Security Act that is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.733" offset="1118827">It was designed to eliminate two of the most common errors that or problems that have cropped into the pension plans, guaranties the workers for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.643" offset="1162503">One is Pension plans, it create impossibly difficult vesting provisions and secondly, underfunding of the pension plan and then disclaiming liability when they terminate the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.523" offset="1210046">Now, to me the difficult vesting problem, the state said that if a person works for their company with a pension plan for 10 or more years, they at least qualify, their service starts to qualify account to the pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.268" offset="1265008">To meet the second problem, underfunding and liability disclaimers, the statute set up this system and said that the company wants to go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.892" offset="1299489">They are to notify the Commissioner of Labor Industry of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.107" offset="1312342">And he in turn conducts an investigation to find out what those pension obligations were and whether or not there is enough money in the pension plan to meet those obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.913" offset="1351630">He then notifies the company as to something called the Pension Funding Charge which is really nothing more than the difference between the amount of money the company did set aside and the amount of money needed to meet the pension obligations as they appear at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.040" offset="1416100">Do you think constitutional right to travel extends to corporations or just the persons?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Allyn</label>
            <text syncTime="343.831" offset="1455284">I am speechless and cannot answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.869" offset="1467405">I had not contemplated that might that in the light of this case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.121" offset="1476391">I think, my experience of the constitutional law is that some constitutional provisions protect corporations and some do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.678" offset="1506693">I know the Fifth Amendment does not the Fourth Amendment does.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.166" offset="1520590">I guess I am not prepared to knowledgeably answer that and I apologize to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.955" offset="1547757">Now, what happens is the Commissioner of Labor Industry pre-notifies the company this amount of money, the company is supposed to go out and purchase annuities.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.121" offset="1592374">And these annuities are nothing more than an insurance policy are bond which when it pays off or pay off on a monthly basis, the amount of pension benefit, the employee would have got under the terms of the pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.261" offset="1636991">The Minnesota statute does not set up a benefit level.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.854" offset="1651307">Now one of the critical features of this Act, and of course lies at the heart of this lawsuit is our statute makes the company liable for its pension promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.325" offset="1689236">Pension promises cannot be disclaimed by staying, well, we are only liable in so far as the amount of money that we and our wisdom decide to set aside in the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.347" offset="1729360">It is an important difference and it will be more clearly shown as we go on.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.658" offset="1802608">The Pension Plan, as a matter of fact, is an adjunct if you will, a separate department from the Collective Bargaining Contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.570" offset="1826222">The promise to pay the pension is in the pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.430" offset="1837612">The benefit level is in the pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.559" offset="1850151">These other rights are in the pension plan but it is up to the company to determine how much money they are going to put in there to meet that obligations that they are incurring.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.261" offset="1920995">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we believe that it is possible that they might, no employee has commenced such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.310" offset="1949207">The reason I think it is passed was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.967" offset="1959760">The evidence shows that for 22 years that this pension plan was in effect, the rank and file, the people out there in the machine shop and what not believed they had a pension plan, acted in accordance, every few years there was a negotiation, benefit levels were increased, people started to retire, started to get pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.994" offset="2035933">Right up to within a week or two before this pension plan was terminated, the company was sending letters to employees telling them what their full pension benefits would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.886" offset="2067489">I believe there is at least an arguable claim that there may be a quasi-contract argument between employee and perhaps even the Labor Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.441" offset="2105733">It is not an issue in this case but it is certainly something we have given some thought.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.956" offset="2143767">Unquestionably, we do not deny it and the fact that the pension plan contained this provision that the company limited its liability to the pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.558" offset="2194131">In other words, you could not go against the other people and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.574" offset="2206252">That is in the pension plan and the fact that they could terminate it anytime was in the pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.421" offset="2221612">We do not dispute it.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.564" offset="2222239">That was consented too by the bargaining representative of the workers?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Allyn</label>
            <text syncTime="539.437" offset="2237703">No question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.680" offset="2242614">Those provisions as far as we know were in the pension plan from the first day, when it was ever enacted in 1950, which dated the years the White Motor came out to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.938" offset="2283679">So if there is, we do not run away from the fact that our statute has the effect of disregarding or if you will modify, I really think it is more accurate to say modifying the provisions of that pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.952" offset="2343760">And the way it modifies it, it is simply this, is that, when the company expends all the money they have in that fund to pay off the pension, our statute permit the state to then go back to the corporation as a whole and seek to recover there.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.565" offset="2406245">It has not happen yet in this case.We have not got to that stage in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.070" offset="2424218">I think an important point to make here is that ERISA, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, it is on the court, there are arguments about this law before came along about 4-and-a half months later and in effect has preempted our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.822" offset="2491196">Our statute went out of effective existence as to future matters, January 1, 1975 so we are in a peculiar one time only situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.978" offset="2543858">There is no dispute either that ERISA’s protection does not apply to what is going on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.523" offset="2574056">Turning to the facts, Minneapolis Malone(ph) Company was a resident of Minnesota for many, many years, a farm implement manufacturing company starting in about 1950, the hourly workers in the plant had a pension plan and when White Motor purchased the company in about 1963, the pension plan, labor agreement and so on were taken over an have continued ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.774" offset="2674993">It is the 1971 pension plan, that is that issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.704" offset="2686800">There has not been a new and negotiated since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.813" offset="2703205">Now, their plan does provide, as I have said, a few things that are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.393" offset="2717520">There is one other difference and that is they would say that employee does not vest unless not only works 10 years but also has to be 40 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.274" offset="2753047">I would argue, now, that is different on our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.004" offset="2763914">Our statute says 10 years employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.142" offset="2776557">As a matter of fact from our evidence the number of people, well, in this case that are affected by that is tiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.586" offset="2806232">Now, there is evidence in the record and I would like to just state this before we move on to how the dispute came to this court that the pension plan through the years was used to track and keep highly qualified and hardworking workforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.962" offset="2863806">And secondly, that it was used by the company to keep wage increases depressed evidence is un-rebutted and it is in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.047" offset="2900169">So, I am going take issue right now on something that Eight Circuit said and that is that well perhaps employees got higher wages in return for not putting money in the pension plan, it is just exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.245" offset="2948965">There is evidence here, people worked for the company for 33 or so years, the timekeepers, I recall and his top salary when he retired was $10,000.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.664" offset="9342591">To hear the argument and to read the briefs of the state and Labor Board as I call the other brief, one would think that there are grave questions of fact undecided in this question of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.546" offset="9418138">And that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.062" offset="9436214">Let us restate the operative facts that relate to questions of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.003" offset="9463904">Counsel inferred and I think said that, well, there were labor contracts negotiated but not pension plans and that the pension plans did not say what funds had to be put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.432" offset="9513641">That is not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.835" offset="9519284">All the pension plans from the first pension plan in 1950 were collectively bargained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.430" offset="9553661">Every amendment to those plans was collectively bargained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.633" offset="9574454">Those plans were made part and parcel of Collective Bargaining Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.878" offset="9603398">Every pension plan that was negotiated contained pension schedules and not as a separate provision but as part of the contract itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.569" offset="9678213">Two very important provisions which are clear and unambiguous and were not put in fine print.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.312" offset="9705171">One, Section 609 of the Pension Plan, pension shall be payable only from the fund and rights to pension shall be enforceable only against the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.111" offset="9752400">And in a separate section of the plan, which if you please, was collectively bargained and negotiated and ratified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.861" offset="9787405">Neither the company nor any trustee or pension committee or any member thereof shall be liable therefore being payment of pension benefits in any manner or to any extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.281" offset="9845083">We do not have here a promise and that the state would like to say a disclaimer of a promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.984" offset="9875907">And that is made clear when you understand what pension plans were like and the kind of problem that arose from funding the pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.985" offset="9927839">When pension plans were placed for the first time or when they are increased, credit is given to service of employees, not just service that they will have from that point forward but services taken place in the past, perhaps not only with this employer but with predecessor employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.493" offset="10009863">The result is in giving credit for that, you get a paper figure and I will explain it in a minute that is called a Past Service Liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.445" offset="10053749">It is a contingent liability because it comes into play only if the pension plan continues in effect, only if the employee continues in employment to qualify for a full pension or at least if he quits has enough service to qualify for a deferred vested pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.860" offset="10135356">Unions and the UAW that negotiated most of these agreements, there is a strong experience and knowledge of all American union, they and other unions recognized that the only way to get agreement on pensions was to have a deferred funding arrangement under which past service liability, this credit system, would be paid over a period of many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.153" offset="10248518">And that was provided in this plan, in 1971, which is the key point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.232" offset="10272864">The pension plan by negotiation provided that these credits that were given to employees for past service would be funded over a period of 35 years, a long time, and created uncertainty but to have what Minnesota has to create here, instant funding would create a situation which would make it impossible for companies, and they would not have agreed the pension plans because if they put a pension plan in, five or ten years later, the plant and had a misfortune and they had to close it, they would have a liability that would be out of all proportion to what they could stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.532" offset="10438062">So there was a reason for deferred funding which was common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.432" offset="10457707">Now, with that background, what was the situation in 1971?</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.066" offset="10472231">As I have said, there was an agreement between the union and the company, the union being the Collective Bargaining agent for all these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.144" offset="10504518">There was an agreement for 35 year funding which I have just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.290" offset="10525102">The union knew in 1971 that during the three year period from ’69 through ’71, this farm division of White Motor has lost $ 21,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.642" offset="10582467">The UAW being knowledgeable also was aware of the fact, that the plan was far from fully funded and in that situation, although the company already had, before ’71, an agreement that we will put in so many dollars each year to fund this over a long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.510" offset="10669925">The union came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.940" offset="10675672">This is a great example of Collective Bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.530" offset="10686017">The union came in and said we are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3670.139" offset="14760492">Let me say, if I have a few minutes, comment briefly on the Pension Disclosure Act argument, I think there has on its face a little weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.993" offset="14815871">But it can be demonstrated to be invalid, because AFLCIO seems to say something a little different which may be as even less validity but relying upon the language that Congressmen and senators used in the Pension Disclosure Act debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.204" offset="14896747">We are going to leave to the states their traditional functions, functions related to operation and administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.509" offset="14926004">Aha, says the state, that means that that they can change the terms of pension agreements because says the state, it is not necessary to cede that power to them and the state expressly says that in their reply brief at page 9, the state did not need to cede anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.235" offset="15000923">All they had to do with leave to the states, the power that it had and that does not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.461" offset="15033733">The day before the Pension Disclosure Act what was the situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.904" offset="15051600">Railway Labor Act had been in effect for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.074" offset="15064244">National Labor Relations Act was in effect, this court had articulated the principal of Labor law preemption clearly in Hanson and Taylor and talked about the imprimatur of federal law protecting contracts and so at that day before the Disclosure Act, there was not any right on the part of a state to change a collective bargaining agreements whether it is in pensions or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.889" offset="15203529">They did not have that right then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.700" offset="15210738">Because if they had that right Labor Law preemption is gone again, it is undermined because if the day before the Pension Disclosure Act, it the state could have said we are going to dictate the terms of Pension agreements, they could say, we are going to insist if you please as the minimum that you give everybody 30 minutes of every hour off so that our employees in our state are well rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.527" offset="15314079">We are going to give everybody a five weeks vacation and those examples also proved, if the court please, that there is no magic in simply saying all we are doing is setting minimums because by setting minimums you can destroy collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.468" offset="15393805">If you say everybody must have 30 minutes an hour off and five weeks of vacation after they have been there one year, this is going to impose burdens if it were valid, burdens on a employer that would be intolerable and the employer would say, well if I have to bear those burdens, If that were valid, if I had to bear those burdens, I cannot assume other burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.786" offset="15491085">So on its face we think that the Pension Disclosure Act does not do anything, to give the state's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.346" offset="15529328">It does not cede power to them and it did not have the power to act in this way before the Pension Disclosure Act.</text>
