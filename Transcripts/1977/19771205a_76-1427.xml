            <text syncTime="31.559" offset="206202">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.262" offset="225010">The appellant in this case is Paul McDaniel, a minister from Chattanooga, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.614" offset="250401">He declared as a candidate and properly filed as a candidate for delegate to the 1977 Tennessee constitutional convention at which time he was sued by one of his opponents to have his name stricken from the ballot because he was a Minister of the Gospel and a provision of the present Tennessee constitution Article 9 provides that no priest or minister of the Gospel may serve in legislative office in Tennessee and the call to the Tennessee constitutional convention of 1977, picked up that qualification for persons who were to serve as delegates to the constitutional convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.620" offset="454365">The matter was heard in the Chancery Court in Hamilton County and the chancellor enjoined the requirement as being in violation of the free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.639" offset="534509">An appeal was taken to the Tennessee Supreme Court which remanded for not having given notice to the Attorney General, the case was then heard in the Chancery Court of Hamilton County with the Attorney General appearing and the chancellor again enjoined the provision on Establishment Clause grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.922" offset="619563">During the period when an appeal was taken to the Tennessee Supreme Court by the State and Ms. Paty, the election was held and Reverend McDaniel won handily.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.441" offset="681735">He came with a few votes of having more than the other three candidates combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.631" offset="706499">The Tennessee Supreme Court heard this case and decided that Reverend McDaniel could not serve because of the provision of the Tennessee constitution and upheld the exclusion on separation grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.657" offset="766580">Counsel then sought a stay from Mr. Justice Stewart which was denied with suggestion that application be made to the Tennessee Supreme Court which was then done and the Tennessee Supreme Court granted a stay until June 20, 1977, at which time the Tennessee Supreme Court denied a second request for a stay and Mr. Justice Stewart then granted appellantâ€™s request for a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.708" offset="894789">The constitutional convention began August 01, 1977 and Reverend McDaniel has been sitting as a delegate to that convention under the stay granted by Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.718" offset="1270848">Now, this case, the issues in this case involve several provisions of a constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.988" offset="1355903">It involves voting rights as well since the right to vote for priest or ministers of the Gospel is an important right.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.435" offset="1397699">We face the same question in this case that was faced by the Court some years back when it addressed the question of whether the persons in the military could be fenced out from candidacy or from exercise of their voting rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.739" offset="1538865">It seems to me that one can say that the rights of candidates, qua candidates were vindicated in these cases although I do not think it makes a great deal of difference even if the Court should choose to vindicate these rights as voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.845" offset="1619322">We also have at stake here Free Exercise Rights because Reverend McDaniel has chosen to exercise his rights as a Minister of the Gospel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.236" offset="5100922">There is a vital distinction between the situation in England in 1641 and the situation in Tennessee in 1796 in that the church was established in England and the danger in England was that the commons which controlled the appropriation of funds, if dominated by Anglican priests, would vogue the state church great sums of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.428" offset="5213666">Since we have no established church in Tennessee and never have had an established church, I think the argument would be an opposite, but I think you know that 1641 Act, with frames like that the church needs few in its.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.439" offset="5397673">Now, there is some question as to whether that applies to state offices, or whether it applies only to federal offices, but it seems to me, coming where it does in the constitution, with the Supremacy Clause, that that clause of a constitution also affords a basis for overturning this constitution, this requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.391" offset="5873519">I think historically, one can justify these clauses in the state constitutions of 1776 because at the time the church in this county had not been disestablished and as Your Honor knows the church was not disestablished I think in Massachusetts until 1830 or 1831, so there was a very great fear of an established church, but the First Amendment with its establishment clause put those fears to rest and it is interesting that this Tennessee provision with 1796, this is only four years after the First Amendment or five years, the -- so it is, this amendment is -- this, this Tennessee provision is really contemporaneous with the First Amendment and it policy wise, it looks back to a time before the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.988" offset="6115831">Now, whether or not the framers of this amendment were anti-clerical, there were some anti-clerical forces in Tennessee at that time or whether they were trying to give a preference for religion, in either case the clause would fall on establishment clause grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.868" offset="6627413">This cannot be changed by our concept of a constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.278" offset="6649042">This Court would not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.811" offset="6659178">However, there are certain practices which cannot be limited I think by the application of activities of a person who wants to enjoy his rights under a constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.635" offset="6714453">For instance, this Court has said in the Castle case, a case is not taken to interpret the question of a right or a belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.019" offset="6760011">This Court said properly that that could not be compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.038" offset="6780073">Likewise the case has said, therefore, you have a question involving sanctions, as it was indicated in the Schempp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.868" offset="6811420">That cannot be condoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.217" offset="6836811">Now, as this Court has said in Cantwell the free actively to have to act is not absolute, it comes in this later category and cannot be subject to certain limitations where there are proper basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.288" offset="6917059">For instance, in the Sherbert case, this Court said that was an indirect burden by inhabit to Free Exercise Right where there is a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.088" offset="6968259">In the Braunfeld case, the Court has said that a state may limit a personâ€™s practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.647" offset="6990515">You know it may cause some inconvenience in time and in Walz case, a valid secular objective is an appropriate subject of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.906" offset="7043596">We submit that that is what we have for consideration before us at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.429" offset="7069614">Now, as to the Establishment Clause, I do not think that at least be said there is any question, but what the purpose of this clause is to keep the state from establishing any form of religion, any requirement for a particular religi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.975" offset="7131785">We submit that there has been no establishment created by the virtue of the Acts in question here, and again, under Schempp, a secular purpose is a valid basis for a legislative purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.768" offset="10307021">The question of whether this case is brought as a class action to this Court, appellantâ€™s position on that issue is that it was properly certified as a class action by the Chancery and that the authority on which the Tennessee Court relied to deny the cross appeal of appellant was in opposite --</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.726" offset="10602832">It is a question of whether or not counsel -- whether that there is a likelihood of this Courtâ€™s decision leaving open the way for counsel to have to come back up and do this sort of thing again on candidacy for legislative office.</text>

            <text syncTime="2647.861" offset="10671377">Indeed that speaking of money, this is a 1983 action for which if appellant prevails there is a right to Attorney fees also under the Voting Right Section of the Voting Rights Act of 1975, there is a provision for an award of Attorney fees to prevailing counsel in Voting Rights litigations or it would seem to me that it would even be in the interest of the State of Tennessee to have the thing decided once and for all unless they want to pay counsel to do the same thing that has already been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.492" offset="10817872">The matter of ministers having special privileges being excluded from the service, ready answer to that which we provided in our brief, is that this is to encourage the Free Exercise Rights of those who have been removed from their churches by being drafted or otherwise going into the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.557" offset="10914107">The tax rights, similarly this is to advance Free Exercise Rights, the tax advantages which are afforded to ministers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.859" offset="10951410">The difference between the tax advantages and the service provisions relating to ministers involved in this case, is it here there is a penalty against ministers and those cases involve preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.145" offset="11020478">So one other point the -- the it -- although it is not commanded a majority view on this Court, it is the case that the appellant is a black minister and in the amended complaint it was alleged that the affect of this provision is to disproportionately exclude a black leadership from candidacy for a public office because this Court can take notice of that fact --</text>
