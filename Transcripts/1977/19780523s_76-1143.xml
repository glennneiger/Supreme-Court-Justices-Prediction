            <text syncTime="38.583" offset="234323">A three-judge District Court for the district of Idaho concluded that in this respect the Act was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment and the Secretary brought the case here by appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.822" offset="411225">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</text>
