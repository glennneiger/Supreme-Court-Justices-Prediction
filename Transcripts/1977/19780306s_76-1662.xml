            <text syncTime="11.573" offset="126298">This case arises under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.587" offset="150331">The State of Alabama is covered under that Act as it's twice been extended in 1970 and 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.571" offset="190246">Alabama must, therefore, obtain prior federal approval before changing any voting practice or procedure that was in effect on November 1, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.600" offset="250327">In this case, however, a Three-Judge District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, held that this requirement of federal approval was not applicable as respects a change by the City of Sheffield, Alabama where Mayor-Council form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.848" offset="327336">The District Court held that the Sheffield was not within the State's coverage under Section 5, even though Sheffield is a subdivision of Alabama, because Sheffield was not a subdivision which conducts registration for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.969" offset="399852">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.498" offset="405913">We hold that Section 5 of the Act covers all political units within designated jurisdictions like Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.100" offset="444365">Mr. Justice Blackmun, joining the Court opinion, has also filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.008" offset="467980">Mr. Justice Powell has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.031" offset="492117">Mr. Justice Stevens joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
