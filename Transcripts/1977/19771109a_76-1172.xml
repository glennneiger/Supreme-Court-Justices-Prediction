            <label>Mr. Francis H. Fox</label>
            <text syncTime="48.817" offset="275190">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.654" offset="290550">This is an appeal from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, a declaratory Judgment action in which the plaintiffs contest the validity of Chapter 55 Section Eight of the General Laws which forbids corporations from expending or contributing moneys in an attempt to influence the vote on any question, referendum question, other than a question which materially affects the assets of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.243" offset="408937">It is specifically provided that no question which relates solely to individual taxes shall be deemed materially to affect the corporate assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.534" offset="462122">In November 1976, there was on a ballot, a question which related solely to individual taxes whether the constitution should be amended to provide for graduated income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.355" offset="529414">The plaintiffs wished to expend or contribute moneys, propose that referendum question by means of media ads and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.412" offset="581554">They did not do so because of the severe criminal penalties attendant upon violation and the threat of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.185" offset="620738">The plaintiffs are five business corporations located in the State with deep and pervasive ties to the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.441" offset="653756">For example; the plaintiff banks have on loan to business corporations literally billions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.425" offset="689701">The plaintiffs among them employ between 20,000 and 25,000 people in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.847" offset="715301">The management of each of the plaintiff corporations believed that the interest of the corporation would be materially affected by the referendum question.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.795" offset="755112">In various ways the record spells out.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.695" offset="766710">For example, the plaintiff banks believed that if the graduated tax reviewed does one more anti-business law in the state that might detract from other businesses from locating in the State or staying in the State and thus diminish the business of the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.042" offset="848107">Two of the plaintiffs, for example; employ highly skilled and thus highly paid engineers, they must compete with other States to attract these engineers to the state, they felt that a graduated income tax might make it more difficult to attract these kinds of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.278" offset="917071">In any event, the management of each of the plaintiffs did believe, the record finds, that the graduated tax would affect the business of the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.960" offset="963778">The Supreme Judicial Court held however, it seems there was no finding that in fact, the graduated tax would affect the interests of the plaintiffs, and they were without First Amendment protection for their prospective speech here.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.254" offset="1036921">The Supreme Judicial Court upheld the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.635" offset="1050504">Plaintiffs appeal, as today we appeal arguing First Amendment, Due Process and that the statute makes use of a presumption yet as a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.517" offset="1110063">Also the underlying standard itself is unconstitutionally vague, materially affecting the assets and Equal Protection and that a single ballot question is singled out for an absolute prohibition as to expenditures or contributions or as any other kind of a ballot question has a different standard applied, one of materially affecting the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.493" offset="1213926">Also on Equal Protection, the fact that business corporations are the only entities that are regulated by Section Eight from top to bottom, Section Eight regulates only business corporations, not partnerships, charitable corporations or other entities similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.441" offset="1289681">Today, I will address the mootness question.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.670" offset="1918605">It would require that committees not to take more than a thousand dollars, it would forbid outside of the state corporations for making any contributions.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.308" offset="1973149">Well but does that not make of the requirement materiality a little easier to fulfill the pending legislation, the two-thirds vote of the stockholders?</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis H. Fox</label>
            <text syncTime="483.626" offset="2014423">No, I look at that as an additional requirement, if it is material you must get two-thirds vote and you must meet the material affecting standard as well and you can only spend a thousand.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.345" offset="2065309">And with the public corporation, your honor, that might mean that to get two-thirds vote, they might have to spend five or six thousand dollars to get the privilege to expend $1,000.00 if it is materially affecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.002" offset="2119957">Those amendments are not before the Court except by way of perhaps relevance on the mootness question, I think they are not really relevant on that either.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.211" offset="2168754">The election is over but the case is not moot because it comes within the capable of repetition yet evading review principle which is enunciated for non-class actions and Weinstein versus Bradford requires, there would be a reasonable expectation that the same offending order will affect the same plaintiffs in the future and that the time within which to seek full review will be too limited to allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.512" offset="2282021">In an analysis with respect to the facts in this case, it would require a reasonable expectation that there will be a grad tax on the ballot in the future, that the prohibitory legislation will remain intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.036" offset="2344088">That that prohibition will affect these plaintiffs in the future and that the timing will preclude review.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.938" offset="2371673">Looking at the first question, will there be a graduated tax on the ballot in the future?</text>
            <text syncTime="579.088" offset="2396333">I would point out that four times in the last 14 years of legislature has put this question on a ballot for the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.135" offset="2428516">Each time they have done so by overwhelming votes, votes in the order of 200:40, this kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.598" offset="2454325">The statistics appear at the Footnote five of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.872" offset="2471461">The legislature obviously feels certain financial pressures.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.130" offset="2496434">This and every other state legislature, there seems to be no abatement in those financial pressures.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.499" offset="2517959">Thirty-six out of the fifty states do have graduated taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.441" offset="2537707">There are public interest groups that advocate and have advocated a graduated income tax as being necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.311" offset="2569159">While it is not mathematically certain what will happen in the future, I think there is a reason of expectation that would nothing to lose, the legislature will once again put this question on the ballot to enable itself to get a more efficient taxing vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.068" offset="2632271">Will the prohibitory statute remain intact?</text>
            <text syncTime="642.296" offset="2649094">The efforts of the legislature to put this question before the people have been matched in that 14 years span, by efforts to arrive at the right statutory formula that will completely preclude corporate spending in the campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.716" offset="2714818">Earlier versions of the prohibition led to narrowing court constructions which allowed corporations to contribute, having now arrived at a complete and out of ban as to any corporate contributions or expenditures, it is unlikely in the extreme that the legislature will soften or eliminate that ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.415" offset="2797574">As I have indicated they may indeed expand the concept to make it more difficult as to other questions but the likelihood that they will change this absolute prohibition is remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.193" offset="2848774">Will these plaintiffs be affected in the future?</text>
            <text syncTime="694.324" offset="2857237">Well, the record of their opposition is a strong one, they contributed to oppose the grad tax in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.168" offset="2888584">Three of them brought the case that gave the corporations the right to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.762" offset="2911050">They brought this case in 1976, they appeal the decision even after the election is over in order to be able to win the right to contribute or expend in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.950" offset="2955771">They remain unalterably opposed to a graduated income tax and will oppose it whenever and wherever it comes up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.804" offset="8703128">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.702" offset="8714726">The appellant has served an absolute constitutional right to expend money to influence the outcome on a ballot question, which was presented to the rulers in 1976 and which would have authorized the imposition of a graduated personal income tax in the State of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.731" offset="8786824">And may they have that their desires relate to a question which they would have had no power to influence directly by voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.041" offset="8816081">We state that there is no such right and not only the taxpayers of the Commonwealth and their duly elected representatives ought to be able to decide how they have taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.729" offset="8858818">And despite the arguments that Mr. Fox has just earnestly advanced, we think there are real differences between corporations and individuals between elections of officials and elections on referendum issues and the expression of voters’ sentiment contained in referendum votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.760" offset="8922974">And between the graduated income tax amendment, which appeared on the 1976 ballot and other kinds of questions and I think that before we reach those specific differences and I address my self to those, I would like to reiterate a little bit about the way the Massachusetts statutory framework works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.064" offset="9004163">In Massachusetts, we have approximately 70 years of experience for the ban on corporate political contributions and roughly an equivalent amount of experience with questions appearing on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.416" offset="9053587">Throughout the history of the Massachusetts statute, the prohibition against corporate contributions has been applied to questions presented to the voter under the initiative in Referendum Amendment and under Article 48 of our state constitution that includes constitutional amendments like to grant tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.546" offset="9130178">Under the Massachusetts statutory framework, the popular initiative in referendum reserved to the people that is to the voters, the right to submit questions and laws to the voters for acceptance or rejection when the normal political processes do not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.294" offset="9201126">And it is this process, this narrow process that Massachusetts seeks to eliminate the corporate influence from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.893" offset="9235503">Throughout the 70 year period as I say we have had a history of interaction between the questions which appear on the ballot and the ban on corporate contributions but it has not been a static history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.974" offset="9295899">Throughout history, we have evolved a statute and the statute now we think at least complies with constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.874" offset="9339471">For the last 14 years, there has been dialog between our State Supreme Judicial Court and between the legislature as to what it is that the legislature can prescribe by way of corporate contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.788" offset="9395059">We have carved out a process for the people to within which they can interact and at the same time strive to protect the rights of businesses to contribute to questions, which in some way might materially affect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.975" offset="9459843">Under the Massachusetts statutory framework, individual citizens can contribute up to $1,000.00 to a candidate, to a community organized on behalf of the candidate, to a political party or to committees organized on behalf of the questions, which appear on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.502" offset="9538001">Business corporations and any kind of business entity which carries on certain kinds of enumerated businesses, generally regulated industries like banks, canals, railroads, cannot contribute to candidates, cannot contribute to committees organized on their behalf, cannot contribute to political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.441" offset="9625668">There is a narrow range of participation open to them under the Massachusetts framework and it permits them to contribute to questions which materially affect their businesses and only on those instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.203" offset="9684810">And I might add that when that narrow range of participation is open to them, unlike individual citizens, they can contribute without limit and they may expend that money without limit in order to protect the business interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.603" offset="9746354">Corporations are not totally excluded from the referendum process, the amendment of the constitution process, they have a number of roles that they can play in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.863" offset="9787419">In order for a constitutional amendment like the graduated income tax to appear on the Massachusetts ballot, it has to first be a affirmatively voted on by two consecutive legislatures and that is not two legislative years, that is two separately elected legislators.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.523" offset="12622018">The challenge that was brought to this specific statute embodied a host of Due Process, Equal Protection kinds of challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.220" offset="12656813">The appellants’ challenged the statute on its face and as applied to them and asserted that there was a constitutional right to contribute or expend monies when there was a material effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.691" offset="12714700">Justice Liakos (ph) in his opinion, appears to have agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment and state constitution confer that kind of right and finds that as applied to these particular defendants this statute is not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.113" offset="12776454">He also appeals to concur with the legislative judgment that a graduated income tax amendment on its face can have no impact on the business interest of specific corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.036" offset="12836117">In accordance with the provisions on Rule 16 of this, I will turn just briefly and just by way of digression to the Mootness arguments that have been raised in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.613" offset="12874361">I agree with Mr. Fox, that there is a doctrine which has been applied by these another Appellate Courts permitting it to review and decide cases which are capable of repetition, evading review even after this specific controversy has passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.941" offset="12947712">We disagree as to the application of the principle to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.869" offset="12971432">We do not believe as Mr. Fox asserts that this case is likely to recur in any real sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.482" offset="13001838">In the 60 years since we have our current form of amending the constitution and in the 29 General Elections that have passed, the a graduated income tax question has appeared on the ballot about four times and three judicial challenges have eventuated challenging the corporate prescription against contributions to oppose or favor that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.424" offset="13097655">But in each instance that the nature of this specific amendment, the form of the prescription embodied in chapter 55 section 8 and in its precursors and the form of the specific challenge that of judicial challenge had eventuated has varied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.095" offset="13160349">I would submit that it is sheer speculation that suggests that if a First Amendment argued is again raised and if the legislature or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts again puts a grad tax on the ballot, if corporations again want to oppose it, that these issues will arise between these parties that there will be the same issues or that will be in this format.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.364" offset="13257420">Furthermore on the second pattern of the analysis, the record amply illustrates that this case, First National Bank versus Bellotti did not arise in a time frame social at the complete appellant reviews was impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.102" offset="13316352">The appellants could have brought their case as the lower Court noted in noted in note 15 of its opinion, a full year before they did bring their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.793" offset="13359089">Had they brought their case reasonably close to the date on which the controversy arose, and had they sought and obtained expedited review in light of the impending election, the appellants clearly could have obtained plenary consideration by this Court within the available time frame.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.076" offset="13428261">Their delay and their delay only is the reason that they have not managed to obtain complete appellate review on this case. Under these circumstances the capable of repetition yet evading review doctrine is in the opposite and the case has become moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.379" offset="13497433">Turning once again to the First Amendment issues that have been raised, the Commonwealth asserts three basic interests which we think justify any incidental impact that this statute might have one any imagined first amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.515" offset="13562008">We start first from the proposition though that corporations do not have first amendments rights per se that they are not natural persons and that they may be restricted to protection of the rights that are contained in their charters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3589.511" offset="14437946">The reason that I would answer yes is that, when an individual invests his money in a corporation like the New York Times or which or like the Boston Globe, there is the idea that his money will be utilized in the dissemination of certain ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.625" offset="14530419">When an individual invests his money in Digital Corporation, in Wyman-Gordon in the First National Bank, there is an expectation on the part of the individual that his funds, that the corporation will exercise its best efforts to protect his investment and to enhance his investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.305" offset="14621221">And that to the extent that, political contributions and political messages, not his views, that permitting corporations to make political statements is an opportunity for the corporation to the corporate management to abuse the trust placed in them on the one hand and at best and at worst to coerce contributions from their shareholders, to use their funds for purposes which are inimical to their own constitutional and political beliefs and I think that that is antithetical to the real purpose behind the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.501" offset="14809930">I see my time is passing and I just want to make sure that I get to assert one time the three interests that we say the state has in restricting speech of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.030" offset="14856114">First, we think that the state has a legitimate interest in preserving the integrity of the referendum and issued of an amendment processes as the people’s quarrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.628" offset="14906478">Second, we think that there is a legitimate state interest in maintaining even in preventing even the appearance of impropriety as it relates to that process and by that I mean that we feel we have the right to remove even the suggestion of a domination by corporations in the political sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.480" offset="14985890">That is not an imaginary evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.706" offset="14994772">In 1972, the corporations, many corporations bonded together and spent $120,000.00 to oppose the graduated income tax as opposed to 7,000 or 15,000 in favor by the proponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.703" offset="15062795">Now that is not the same under influence argument that the Court, in Mr. Fox’ view laid to rest in Buckley and Valeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.119" offset="15092470">We are not saying that that an individual who is a millionaire cannot use his funds to promote his political beliefs or that an individual who is talented in political debate cannot use his talents or is asserting to Court is that, the state has a right of keeping corporations which do not belong in the initiative process in the first place from preventing a full and robust debate among those individuals who have a direct interest in the correct answering of the questions before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.920" offset="15231650">And the third interest that we assert to the Court, is the state has a legitimate interest in protecting the minority shareholders of these individual corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.088" offset="15272297">And I would suggest to the Court that Cort versus Ash has not said that protection for minority shareholders is a secondary interest at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.177" offset="15308659">That Cort and Ash is a statutory construction case in which this Court did not find the existence of an implied civil right of action under the federal election.</text>
