            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="14.620" offset="138522">The ultimate question in this case is whether the Federal Communications Commission has any power to regulate a radio broadcast that is indecent, but not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.132" offset="192543">On a Tuesday afternoon, in October of 1973, the respondent Pacifica Corporation which operates a radio station in New York City, broadcast a record of a monologue by George Carlin entitled "Filthy Words."</text>
            <text syncTime="49.405" offset="277702">The broadcast was heard by a gentleman riding an automobile with his young son who wrote a letter of complaint to the Commission, complaining that contained words that were improper for public broadcast</text>
            <text syncTime="64.833" offset="339351">.The Commission ultimately decided that the broadcast was indecent because it contained words that referred to excretory and sexual activities or organs and such words were indecent and the Commission let the respondent know that although no sanction would be imposed for this broadcast, that the fact that such a broadcast had been made would be noted in it's file and kept available for future reference in the event the similar broadcast were made in the future or at the question of license renewal came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.965" offset="495877">The radio appealed to the Court of Appeals for the district of Columbia which reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.243" offset="516984">In three different opinions, the Court of Appeals in effect held that the regulation -- that the announcement of the Commission was improper, that it too broadly condemned in decent language.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.778" offset="567139">The Commission asked for certiorari in this Court and we granted certiorari to review the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.836" offset="595456">There are four questions that the Court decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.846" offset="611443">The first is whether the case involves a review of the general rule or merely a determination that the particular broadcast as given in the afternoon to an audience which included large numbers of children as well as the adult audience could be regulated as indecent and the Court first holds that the focus is on the particular broadcast rather than a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.977" offset="723978">Secondly, the Court considers whether the Section of the Communications Act which prohibits censorship prohibited, the Commission from reviewing the matter and the Court holds that prohibition which was enacted as part of the same statute to prohibit the use of indecent profane or obscene language is not applicable to the subsequent review of program contents such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.253" offset="837036">And there is no dissent within the court on that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.298" offset="853232">The third question the court considers is whether the broadcast is indecent within the meaning of the statute when it does not appeal to the prurient interest and therefore is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.611" offset="902551">And on this issue the court holds by majority five to four that the broadcast was indecent within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.599" offset="938496">Justice Stewart has written a dissent in which justice Brennan, justice Marshall and justice White have joined taking the position that the statute does not prohibit the broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.860" offset="999518">Then the fourth issue is whether the commission has whether the First Amendment to the United States Constitution precludes the commission from exercising any sort of censorship or regulatory power over an indecent broadcast of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.270" offset="1073183">On this issue the court has also divided five members the court hold that the First Amendment does not prohibit the exercise of this kind of power and therefore sustains the action of the commission in asserting its regulatory jurisdiction over this kind of broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.592" offset="1150401">The opinion which I have filed although joined by a majority on the first three issues is only joined by the Chief Justice and justice Rehnquist on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.063" offset="1192301">Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun on this issue and Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which he notes that although they were not normally reach the constitutional issue, that he feels the court is so flagrantly wrong in this case that it should be discussed and he is joined by Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
