            <text syncTime="60.349" offset="321355">The Gila National Forest was created by a series of presidential proclamations issued between 1899 and 1910 which reserves certain public lands in New Mexico to entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.312" offset="397215">The question in this case is whether under the Doctrine of Reserved Water Rights, those reservation proclamations also reserved waters of the real members for the needs of the Gila National Forest for “instream flow” for fish and wildlife, for stock watering and for recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.890" offset="503481">The case began before a Special Master appointed by the State District Court in New Mexico who concluded that the United States did indeed have such water rights for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.768" offset="574952">The State District Court disagreed with the Special Master upon objection the objection of the State of New Mexico and held, first, that the United States did not have a reserved water right for recreation purposes for use in the forest. Secondly, the State District Court held that the United States did not have reserved water rights for stock watering purposes within the national forest and thereby leaving grazing permitees to obtain whatever rights they could under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.313" offset="745166">Thirdly, the State District Court held that the United States could not have a reserved water right for an “instream flow” in real members for those or any other purposes and fourthly, the District Court without comment deleted from the Master’s proposed decree, a water right for wildlife.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.415" offset="1713577">The New Mexico Supreme Court reached this holding because it concluded that the purposes for which the United States claimed reserved rights from the real members for the Gila National Forest were not within the purposes for which a forest could be established under the Organic Administration Act of 1897.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.222" offset="1796856">Under that Act in New Mexico’s Court’s view, a national forest can only be established for the two purposes of supplying timber or supplying water for downstream appropriators.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.277" offset="1848996">The New Mexico Court reasoned that the reservation of land for the Gila National Forest could not have reserved water rights for stock watering or recreation as those were not the purposes of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.440" offset="1905734">The New Mexico Court also held that the United States could not reserve an "instream flow” for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.220" offset="1932797">The specific present rights which the United States seeks in the members are set forth at pages 192 and 193 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.711" offset="1978773">There, as set forth, 91.18 acre fee of consumptive use, mostly for stock watering.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.433" offset="2021613">There are also listed a few rights there on page 192 and 193 for domestic recreation which is another word for campground.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.531" offset="2062051">There is one small right listed for tenth of an acre foot for wildlife.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.791" offset="2079083">In addition, there are some rights listed for matters not in contention here for stock watering and residential and that would be at the ranger’s home with the fire tower.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.890" offset="2163511">The Special Master’s report also provided that the United States could have a year to present additional claims for the future needs of the forest if the United States chose to do so because the District Court, however, ruled as a matter of law that the United States could not have most of the rights it sought here, and because the United States appealed that ruling, the time never arrived for the United States to submit any evidence of future needs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.689" offset="4878678">Our first argument under the Organic Act, Your Honor is that those provisions of the Organic Act which call for the protection and preservation of the National Forest must by implication have reserved water for the National Forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.563" offset="4950149">First the Congress stated as its first reason for the establishment of National Forest that they would be improved and protected and secondly Your Honor, the Congress twice gave clear instructions to the Secretary that he should take actions to protect and preserve the forest at one point referring to preservation of the forest as one of the objects of the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.391" offset="5045548">Thus we argue Your Honor to the extent that the Secretary needs water so as to protect the forest it must be reserved or Congress’ plan would be thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.126" offset="5088389">For example, the development and placement of stock waterholes is often the only way or the best way to insure an even distribution of the stock over the forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.411" offset="5137604">A failure to achieve an even distribution of stock can quickly lead to overgrazing, growing land and erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.295" offset="5177101">Thus when the forest ranger locates a water source for stock he is not thinking simply of providing water for use, but he is also thinking of protecting the very soil the forest from erosion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1439.457" offset="5837790">Yes, I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.663" offset="5858583">The Congress clearly did not wish the National Forest to be treated the way National Parks were, which is to say areas where the resources would not be used in an economic way such as cutting timber, range, or hunting of deer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.317" offset="5933189">However, it is very clear it seems to us that Congress did intend for the forest to be used, there were a lot of references in the legislative history, to the effect that the forest would be places of use and not places of none use and camping by all sorts of people was something that was done quite regularly in those days, not only for the kind of camper we think of today, but campers in connection with grazing and other uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.824" offset="6063279">Recreation use of the forest was known at that time and furthermore I should say that the forest service assumed from the very beginning that this was one of the purposes of the National Forest and Congress in fact in 1899, two days before the first proclamation was issued for this forest, passed a law authorizing the Chief of the Forest Service to lease land in the National Forest adjacent to hot springs for the purposes of recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.819" offset="6191174">I wish to make one other argument under the Organic Act and that concerns the provision of the Act which refers to occupancy and use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.132" offset="6232448">The statute directs the Secretary to issue rules and regulations to regulate the occupancy in use of the forest and we would argue that to the extent that he needs water for that purpose, water is also reserved and it would work this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.826" offset="6299217">For example, a ranger would often times go out and examine the range and determine that it is under utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.635" offset="6342475">Now, he may prevent over use by fencing, but often times the only way he can prevent under utilization of the range is by providing a water source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.846" offset="6379360">In our view the extent to which the forest service needs water for use in occupancy to preserve and protect and to promote all of the uses which Congress contemplated, water is reserved under the Reserve Rights Doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.112" offset="6488343">There are two fundamental mistakes in the United States' approach to the reservation of waters in National Forests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.726" offset="6514884">The United States views its powers over western waters as the rule instead of the exception and the US either ignores or hides from the fact that Congress explicitly relinquished control of the flow and the use of the waters in our National Forests of respective states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.749" offset="6590952">Compounding that fundamental, legal, and historical misapprehension of matter, the United States also ignores the fact that unlike any other Federal reservation of lands from the public demand, the National Forest were designed with respect to water to maximize water yield to appropriators under State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.947" offset="6699726">I would like to make reference to your question Mr. Justice White about whether or not there were any private users up stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.670" offset="6734626">In the forest there are in the real members, drainage of the forest, there are 17,000 acres of patented free land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.743" offset="6770884">There are a number of diversions on some of these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.098" offset="6780288">Some of the diversions are being made by other parties to this adjudication against whom at this point in the litigation, the rights of the United States have not vested.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.716" offset="6854789">I believe it is and it is also live in the sense that if the Court were to recognize a minimum “instream flow,” we would effectively prevent the transfer of any water rights under State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.875" offset="6903481">That is just as much a part of the property right under State Law as is the right to divert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.317" offset="6929186">If we jump over to the Gila side in the same forest, you can see its effect on Phelps Dodge Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.241" offset="6956875">Phelps Dodge spent $125 million buying up water rights transferring them to a point above certain forest lands, in total spent about $425 million, creating a smelting plant and subsequent to all of that the United States by filing a paper in the Office of the State Engineer in New Mexico informs Phelps Dodge they would now like to claim a minimum “instream flow” below that point of diversion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.650" offset="7422482">No, we think it does fit in. We are not denying the existence of the Reservation Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.273" offset="7440977">What we are asking the Court to do is precisely what it did in Cappaert, to look at the authorizing legislation under which lands might be withdrawn from the Public domain and then apply the principle of the reservation doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.955" offset="7491759">In this situation forests were created in large part to protect the watersheds in order to maximize water yield to appropriators under State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.097" offset="7532301">The National Legislator, the Secretary of the Interior repeatedly in his rules and regulations right out the door, 26 days after the Act was passed, noted that control of the flow and use of water was left to the individual states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.457" offset="7617773">By its assertion of claims to minimum “instream flows” it seems that the United States is going quite beyond what was intended before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.128" offset="7656435">At the same time, the decision of the New Mexico Supreme Court does not preclude the assertion of a claim to minimum “instream flows” provided that claim comes within the ambit of the purposes of the Organic Administration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.143" offset="7724457">No such evidence was put on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.577" offset="7734280">The only evidence that was put on in this case related to the protection of fish and we submit that it is patently clear that the legislation and its history do not permit a reading that would say that fish purposes were among the purposes for which the lands of the forest could have been withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.070" offset="7832186">Your Honors, the United States' reply brief, while in my view says virtually nothing, I think it is probably the most telling brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.710" offset="7874818">In response to the legislative history of the Creative Act of 1891, that piece of legislation that authorizes the President to withdraw lands for National Forests, in response to some 40 pages of history relating to the Organic Administration Act of 1897, the Act which limits the purposes for which lands could be withdrawn under the 1891 Act, in response to the legislative history of all of the applicable rights of statutes up on into this century, in response to the history of relating to the decisions of the Secretary of the Interior, in response to the decisions and opinions of the general land office and indeed the United States Attorney General in its replay brief, the United States offers no rebuttal, it offers no legal history, it offers no law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.486" offset="8089858">Instead what the United States tries to do in our view is to muddy the waters, is to make it a little bit more difficult to see this case clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.342" offset="8129251">The United States explains that we have somehow ameliorated the effect of the New Mexico Supreme Court’s decision in our brief that we have made a concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.633" offset="8690466">That is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.235" offset="8690361">Indeed subsequent to the decision in the case, the United States went before one of our State District Courts and put on evidence in support of what it says we just now said they can do in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.853" offset="8690257">I do not think their understanding of the decision was any different than ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.389" offset="8690152">The decision was rendered the way it was because there was no evidence in the record for any of these other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.146" offset="8690048">In the United States brief it also refers to a number of appropriation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.110" offset="8689943">This Court has never before held that reserved water rights arise out of appropriations of money, reserved water rights arise out of withdrawals of land from the Public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.049" offset="8689839">The United States most importantly, also argues that the US never relinquished its rights, that somehow there is a broad power in the United States that makes these claims accessible now and because of that broad power, this Court should not strictly construe the statutes authorizing the withdrawal of land from the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.829" offset="8689734">I think their interpretation of the law is most definitely wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.569" offset="8689630">They make reference to the Rio Grande Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.221" offset="8689525">Indeed though in the Rio Grande Case and subsequently in another case called Gutierrez v. Albuquerque Land and Irrigation Company, this Court said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.940" offset="8689421">Of course as held in the Rio Grande Case even a state as respect streams within its boarders in the absence of specific authority from Congress cannot by its legislation destroy the right of the United States as the owner of lands bordering on a stream to the continued flow of its waters, so far at least as maybe necessary for the beneficial uses of the government property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.029" offset="8689316">They seem to say that we really do not need the reservation doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.171" offset="8689212">That just by virtue dicta, the United States could by fiat and say, “We now want water in the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.228" offset="8689107">We are going to use water for this purpose, therefore, it is ours.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.341" offset="8693287">The waters and the rest were severed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.760" offset="8706975">Plenary control was relinquished to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.584" offset="8718260">When Justice Sutherland used the adjective plenary, he used it advisedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.188" offset="8736650">It means complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.110" offset="8744382">When the waters were severed they were severed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.518" offset="8753995">In the United States' view there is some illogical, incomplete severance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.046" offset="8768102">There is no such thing in logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.620" offset="8782417">It is also clear from a reading of Rio Grande that, that case was a case that says the United States may protect its right to navigability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.693" offset="8830691">That case got back to the Supreme Court three years later in 1903.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.446" offset="8853679">If the Court takes a look at that opinion, it is clear also that, that case related only to navigability and not to none navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.611" offset="8886384">The important language with respect to none navigable waters is in Justice Sutherland’s opinion in 1935, in California Oregon Power Company v. Beaver Portland Cement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.415" offset="8933613">He said, “In the absence of Federal Legislation the States would be powerless to affect the Riparian Rights of the United States, but the authority of Congress to vest such power in the States and that it has done so by the legislation to which we have referred, cannot be doubted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.802" offset="9007174">There is no question that the severance of water affects the rights of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.405" offset="9029535">No question whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.502" offset="9033924">You cannot use Rio Grande as broad brush to somehow broaden the Reservation Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.055" offset="9060151">It does not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.487" offset="9097871">Your Honor, I think what this case boils down to is an attempt by the United States to protect commendable environmental values through a scheme of legislation that was designed to do something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.846" offset="9155341">We have laid out the history of the applicable legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.394" offset="9169551">If that history is understood, there is no way in my opinion that Your Honors could believe and reverse the decision of the New Mexico Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.657" offset="9214586">It is simply impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.860" offset="9223364">If this case is decided on the basis of historical reality, instead of on the basis of the regrets of certain Justice Department Lawyers, now we are confident that the decision of the New Mexico Supreme Court will be upheld.</text>
