            <label>Mr. Robert S. Keller</label>
            <text syncTime="13.554" offset="134102">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.753" offset="146954">Jurisdiction has been reserved in this case, a double jeopardy case proceeding out of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.746" offset="166912">We are proceeding under the provisions of 28 United States Code 1254 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="27.497" offset="189899">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in effect held that Montana Statute 95-1711 taken from the model penal code was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.305" offset="229187">1711 permits a retrial if the first trial has been terminated before the first witness is sworn as distinguished from the federal rule that when the jury is empaneled and sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.254" offset="280910">Some of the facts in the case that give rise to the jurisdiction of the Court, this proceeded in 1974, a nine count information against Bretz and Cline and Mrs. Cline, and she is not relevant to this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.566" offset="338170">One of the counts and one of the gut counts was obtaining money by false pretenses alleged to have occurred between January and February of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.699" offset="378712">After the jury was empaneled and sworn the defendants moved, made several motions, but a motion in limine to confine the state to the confines of the information, January to February of 1974 and unfortunately a typographical error, it should have been January 1973 to February 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.991" offset="463872">It put the trial judge in a dilemma for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.769" offset="479023">The state moved to amend to correct the error and I bring this up because Justice Tuttle in the Ninth Circuit commented that this is simply a formal defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.933" offset="511623">The trial judge was in this dilemma; to permit the amendment meant we were talking an additional year of time against which the defendant had to defend at the last minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.907" offset="547568">Secondly, in 1973 the Montana legislature enacted a comprehensive sweeping Montana Criminal Code of 1973 that repealed all preexisting substantive law effective January 1, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.026" offset="603992">So in essence, they were going to Court on this particular count, there were three counts, but this particular one on an offense that had been repealed before it was alleged to have been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.434" offset="641609">So the Trial Court was in a real dilemma and sua sponte dismissed the three counts that had the typographical error.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.607" offset="674314">The state as I indicated had moved to amend, and this had been strenuously objected to by the defendants and that is when the Court sua sponte dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.285" offset="713080">They then dismissed the remaining six counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.577" offset="722275">The state that of its own motion re filed a new information, corrected the defect and filed a two count information.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.818" offset="747248">The first count was grand larceny and it tracked one of the six counts that the state had moved to dismiss of its own motion and the second count was obtaining money by false pretenses with the typographical error corrected and the jury found, there was a new trial, and the jury found the defendants guilty of this obtaining money by false pretenses, one of the counts had the typographical error.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.782" offset="2271023">Both accounts where the appellees were there throughout at all so they could probably more properly answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.168" offset="2296623">The first question that we have, is this point in time selected in the federal system mandated by the constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="558.894" offset="2315535">The ancillary question is if it is not, do we still have to follow it in our state under the doctrine of incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.177" offset="2344583">Historically and this is conceded in appellee’s brief that the common law jeopardy was not a problem until there had been a conviction or an acquittal and at the time of the drafting the constitution this was a state of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.767" offset="2406964">I have looked frankly, for the source of the federal rule that it commences at the time that the jury is empaneled and sworn and the closest that I can come to any suggestions to you is, there was a real problem for government appeals up until the Criminal Appeals Act of 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.635" offset="2470494">The language in the Criminal Appeals Act was such that it permitted a writ of error to be pursued inter alia from the decision or a judgment sustaining a special plea in bar, when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.669" offset="2526605">But we do not know when that point was as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.119" offset="2536427">The general rule at that time in the text books, encyclopedias was at the time the jury had been empaneled and sworn, but the minority view gave a distinction of after conviction of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.077" offset="2576237">There was a dichotomy that gave nothing in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.077" offset="2604240">So the point that we are raising now had really never been touched then.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.855" offset="2623362">The other suggestion that I have is going far back to Perez in 1824, which we have always contemplated as being the start of manifest necessity and if you read it and as you will recall, and I am sure you do from the yesterday’s argument, this was a case with a hung jury so all the evidence that was in the case was all over, and Justice Storey in a terse opinion is faced with the dilemma, what are you going to do when the jury – you have got a jury and you cannot get rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.352" offset="2741331">You got to do something and somehow, as you read that opinion, in essence it says, giving rise to manifest necessity after the jury is there and it cannot arrive at something, there is a manifest necessity or to meet the end of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.745" offset="2790859">From that I have to assume that and as you all know we had a pretty liberal interpretation for a long time of what is manifest necessity, I have to believe that nobody worried about what occurred after the jury was empaneled and sworn and that just gradually evolved this cut off point.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.113" offset="2852404">It never was a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.601" offset="2858360">As such this Court never even addressed until 1963 and that was in Downum, so we got a long period of time before the issue even comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.769" offset="2895036">Downum was not only handled as a manifest necessity case, the issue I am raising was not raised and it was a federal case to boot.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.969" offset="2923770">So nobody questioned when Downum just simply came out and said jeopardy attaches when the jury is sworn -- empaneled and sworn in a jury case.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.747" offset="3334938">We tried to research for that in point and ran into a quagmire.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.784" offset="3347058">I know that Kentucky has from the modal penal code, Arizona did and I do not know if they still do.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.873" offset="3371405">New York did and they just now held their own statute unconstitutional following the federal rules, so I do not know if I want to cite that as an authority and honestly Pennsylvania had something comparable to open up from the penal code and beyond that, no I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.445" offset="3441726">One of the reasons for it is, in going through the state statutes, the way this thing is drafted, you have to look for a negative, you cannot find something as to when there is jeopardy attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.989" offset="3479865">You have to go read several statutes to come back to find out what it does mean in that state, but I do not know for sure that there are two others along with us today that have it, Kentucky and Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.304" offset="3541096">The Somerville case in any event followed Downum and just said without giving a reason and I am sure you noted in the brief we have emphasized this throughout, never has there been a reason given for the rule that had been followed the in the Federal Court and there was no as you pointed out, no reason to question until Benton, but the language in Serfass in 1975 is significant to us and I do not want to be out of line of trying to quote something that was said that is out of context, but the defense has relied upon Serfass because it followed Somerville and it followed Downum.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.185" offset="3664707">We rely upon it because now for the first time, the Court has really looked at the point at which jeopardy attaches and as you recall in the Serfass, this was a point in time prior to even having the jury empaneled so the comments are somewhat relevant, but I do not want to take advantage of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.707" offset="3730745">Nevertheless, eight of you concurred on this opinion and this is what we read from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.697" offset="3758748">As an aid to the decision of cases in which the prohibition of the double jeopardy clause has been invoked, the Courts have found it useful to define a point in criminal proceedings at which the constitutional purposes and policies are implicated by a resort to the concept of attachment of jeopardy and goes on to say in a jury case, it is when the jury is empaneled and sworn and in a non jury, when the first witness is sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.881" offset="3859476">The Court has consistently adhered to the view that jeopardy does not attach and the constitutional prohibition can have no application until a defendant is put to trial before the trier of the facts whether the trier be a jury or a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.688" offset="3918722">The constitutional policies underpinning the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee are not implicated before that point in the proceedings at which jeopardy attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.777" offset="3951009">As we have noted above, the Court has consistently adhered to the view that jeopardy does not attach until a defendant is put to trial before the trier of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.190" offset="3984655">This is by no means a mere technicality, nor is it a rigid mechanical rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.087" offset="4008270">It is of course like most legal rules an attempt to impart content to an abstraction and you can appreciate why we like this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.776" offset="4043065">Without risk of a determination of guilt, jeopardy does not attach and neither on appeal nor further prosecution constitutes double jeopardy and that is specifically our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.523" offset="4094056">We take the position that as a matter of law, no jeopardy attaches until a witness says something incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.895" offset="4127493">If at the time the jury was empaneled and sworn, the prosecution rested as a matter of law, the case would have to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.655" offset="4154556">If at the time that the first witness is sworn, the prosecution rested, the case as a matter of law, the would have to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.037" offset="4188097">It really means that in terms of when jeopardy attaches, that it varies with each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.616" offset="4210353">The first witness in a homicide may be a pathologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.049" offset="4220071">He does not have anything to do with guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.253" offset="4224982">He just wants to identify the corpus delicti.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.847" offset="4235326">So somewhere in there, there is a risk of determination of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.182" offset="4252672">Our position is that our point in time is sooner than jeopardy actually attaches and the federal system is even sooner than our point in time and it is an aid to the Court just exactly as Serfass said that it was, this is an aid to the Court that we use.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.683" offset="5302689">In using both the blending of the federal and the state rule, they were able to make their motion in limine after the jury was empaneled and sworn which in the federal system, they would have had to make it before the jury was paneled and sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.069" offset="5356188">They made it between the two periods of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.524" offset="5378027">That puts them in real disadvantage, so when they make the motion, that they made in the manner that they made it, truly was in ingenious because they have got jeopardy attaching under the federal rule and they still can make their motion in limine before they have commenced under the state rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.906" offset="5455558">I really looked for a basis for this and the only thing that I can find that is, I really do not want to use the word weakness in our position, but that is I guess for lack of a better phrase, the weakness, the only weakness I can come to is the valued right concept and the valued right concept has been espoused.</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.090" offset="9120329">Now, as to the merits of the case, Mr. Keller throughout this litigation has maintained that there are no constitutional policies underlying the federal rule, the rule announced by this Court and Downum v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.445" offset="9193680">He has taken the position at the Montana rule offers as much protection to a defendant as does the Downum rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.876" offset="9223460">On the contrary, I would submit to the Court that historically the Downum rule has protected two basic interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.207" offset="9260763">First of all, it protects the defendant from having a judge or a prosecutor dismiss a case when it becomes apparent to either one of them that a conviction is going to be unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.046" offset="9308097">Secondly it protects, it ensures the defendant that he can proceed to trial before a particularly chosen tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.406" offset="9345504">Now, both of these interests are best served by having jeopardy attached at an early stage in the trial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.455" offset="9373716">And the point at which jeopardy attaches as it had been pointed out in the Somerville decision merely begins the inquiry as to whether or not there a double jeopardy interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.675" offset="9418647">The mere fact that it is attached does not necessarily mean that the defendant’s double jeopardy interests are going to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.852" offset="9447382">For example in the Somerville case the interest, in sound judicial administration and the ends of public justice were the prevailing factors and so it is just a matter of balancing those interest out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.078" offset="9500254">The problem with moving the point of attachment to a later stage in the proceeding is that you then trade a period of time during which the prosecutor can ask for a mistrial or dismissal and he can do so without making any showing of manifest necessity or extraordinary circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.394" offset="9581547">Well, of course there is still the factor of the sound judicial discretion of the trial judge as to whether to grant that protection?</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.515" offset="9746014">Number one protecting the defendant’s right to proceed before a particular tribunal and secondly, ensuring a judge or prosecutor cannot dismiss when they think that a conviction is unlikely without showing manifest necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.017" offset="9804005">I think that is sufficiently protected under the Downum rule and what I am saying is that if you move the point in time as Montana has done, then you start to jeopardize those two interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.781" offset="9847055">Because as you pointed out, during that period of time, you got such things as the opening statement of the prosecutor and more importantly, you have got the possibility of an opening statement by the defense counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.468" offset="10061782">I think that this Court has specifically said in the Jorn case that at that point in time represents a point in time at which time constitutional policies come into play.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.147" offset="11180554">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.028" offset="11204064">In the argument presented before this Court, there was an issue raised that I would like to respond specifically to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.406" offset="11233530">In Benton v. Maryland, the Court said that the same constitutional standards apply against both the state and the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.535" offset="11270102">As I see this case, this is an effort to spin off the non-constitutional baggage of the Benton decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.861" offset="11311375">That is the way I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.647" offset="11318480">In other words, we are trying to create a non-constitutional parsing of what Benton v. Maryland has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.616" offset="11354425">Now, that may be fine, but I think that is what the issue is as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.259" offset="11376995">We are trying to say that it is a non-constitutional issue as to how this constitution should be applied in the state of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.009" offset="11415969">I see that as the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.474" offset="11421821">Now, I do not think that is a valid theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.136" offset="11440420">I do not think the state of Montana either legislatively or judicially should be examining decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States to determine what is non-constitutional baggage in terms of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.773" offset="11487023">The Supreme Court applies the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.114" offset="11500397">It decides when the constitutional rule should be applied and the states and the legislatures should follow it in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.565" offset="11534147">Now, the question is also raised as to whether there is any significant difference as to the time when jeopardy attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.910" offset="11567584">I think it is a very important question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.045" offset="11588064">Let me suggest one point to you before I approach that question and that is the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.518" offset="11622023">It used to be and perhaps I am adopting from the equal protection cases the rule of compelling state interest or at least some rationale rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.644" offset="11662461">What we are doing here is not justifying, the state is not up here justifying and saying there is some compelling need not to have this rule that has been announced in Downum and Somerville and all of the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.478" offset="11717840">There is some compelling reason in the state of Montana why we should not have this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.893" offset="11743545">So that when we talk about the difference, I to not want to be on the defensive by simply saying to you that maybe I can satisfy you as to the significant difference and maybe I cannot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.561" offset="11846154">In the state of Montana, we have conclusive presumption contrary to Murray v. U.S. and the teachings of the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.299" offset="12125142">Well, that is why the issue is very narrowly drawn in this case Your Honor because if the Supreme Court in Downum, Somerville and all the others, if that is an application of the Supreme Court then the State of Montana cannot change it, that is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.804" offset="12199120">The issue in this case seems to be as to whether we can take of a portion of what the Court has said and say that that is non-constitutional baggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.042" offset="12240080">Now, that is as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.600" offset="12246350">If it is a non-constitutional issue as to the time when jeopardy attaches then of course there is not any significance and of course the thing can apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.922" offset="12299640">When you talk about the question of whether there is any significant difference, the question is whether you have a valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal that US v. Jorn and US v. Sisson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.327" offset="12365259">I think there is some merit as to permitting the prosecution a preemptory challenge to the entire panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.414" offset="12397547">I think there is a lack of reciprocity, perhaps like in voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.175" offset="12424609">What I am saying to the Court I think is simply that that issue was addressed to the Court in the issue by Mr. Chief Justice Tuttle in this particular manner in which he said on page 15 is that the valued right to have this trial completed by a particular tribunal independent of the threat of bad faith conduct by the Judge or prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.755" offset="12530980">Now, I take that to mean that you are entitled to the double jeopardy argument regardless of whether the discretion of the Court in dismissing was in good faith or in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.256" offset="12576956">I think that when we come to a valued right, the question is simply, is the person in jeopardy when the jury is empaneled and sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.033" offset="12620005">I think that he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.166" offset="12628574">I think the opportunity to have preemptory challenge to the entire panel, in our state, we are now giving some preliminary instructions as to what the law is in this particular case, we have opening statements in which there are outlines of what they intended to prove.</text>

            <text syncTime="3605.325" offset="14501240">First of all, we have an authoritative statement in the Supreme Court of the United States as to this particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.765" offset="14538960">In other words, that jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.315" offset="14565187">I think that is a difference and a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.930" offset="14575636">There was something bag and baggage, that was a part of double jeopardy as enunciated by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.543" offset="14598102">I think that is a difference and the distinction in Williams v. Florida and Apodaca. Furthermore, it is my belief that there is a difference because the application, the Court is called upon to apply this constitutional standard and the question is when should it be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.960" offset="14675738">It is implicit in the constitutional provision itself as to when it should be applied and I think that that makes it – it involves itself more than the issues raised on just those jury issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.094" offset="14744283">For those reasons and others, we think that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3686.413" offset="14825576">After the swearing of the jury, in Montana and I take it the prosecutor is permitted to make the first opening statement, if he elects to do so, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="3697.427" offset="14869671">Ordinarily there is a brief statement made by the trial judge before the jury is even voir dire to give them some concept of why they are here and then the question starts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3708.955" offset="14915751">I am addressing myself now to the possible damage or injury to the defendant that can occur from the opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.688" offset="14958696">If an opening statement is let us assume one that is outrageously bad and misrepresentation by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.162" offset="14992551">Of course the prosecutor is not going to move for a mistrial on that ground, but the defense might do so and I suppose under Montana procedure and practice, if the opening statements have been excessively bad, the Court could grant that motion?</text>

            <text syncTime="3761.654" offset="15126507">Well, his position I am sure and knowing the talent that we have in Montana would be that he was forced to do this and it is double jeopardy and I think there would be some merit to that approach in the proper situation, but I am sure that is not why you asked the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.671" offset="15174572">We do not need to get that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.497" offset="15181886">Yes, if the conduct of the prosecutor were outrageous, it would be the defense move for a mistrial or conceivably the Court of its own motion grant a mistrial just for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.155" offset="15228593">It would not be too unlike yesterday’s case when you spell out the reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="3818.342" offset="15353249">Just to respond to some of the comments; we did not extract this part out of the motion in limine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.447" offset="15377700">This motion at that time which at that time leaves the state in the position of trying to convict for an offense that was repealed a month before it is alleged to have taken place, is not an extraction, that went to the heart of everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.165" offset="15424616">They had to do something with those three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.202" offset="15436737">A part of the confusion that arose here is of the nine counts, three were subject to the problem so the judge dismissed them sua sponte.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.755" offset="15466934">The state dismissed of its own motion the remaining six and I think this is Mr. Leaphart’s point that he is still sweating out, then on the retrial, one of the defective counts and one of the counts that state dismissed were all that were charged, so there is still five counts sitting out and I see what his point is and we do not intend to prosecute, but that is not just something we just brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.194" offset="15556691">We did not even know anything about this until it just came out in the Solicitor General’s opinion and this is the first time that we even thought about it, no we will not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.317" offset="15593158">The voir dire questions that were that were commented on as true in both systems, federal or state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.814" offset="15611130">If you are going to talk about opening statements, that is fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.008" offset="15619907">That can come up under the state system, but if you are going to affect that jury by your voir dire questions, you affect them under either system, so that is not a distinction between the two systems, if you want to affect your jury because they are not empaneled and sworn yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.495" offset="15677899">The valued right concept may be a valuable one, but I would like to call the Court’s attention that we do not see it from this Court until 1948 in Wade against Hunter and then we are talking about a court marshal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.920" offset="15723561">In all candor with the Court, Justice Douglas relied on Cornero, a lower Court case of 1931 that refers to the valued right and in further candor, I found the valued right as such clear back in United States against Simmons, United States against Shoemaker and that is back in 1840, but nobody said what it was and the most that I have a feel of it was because that is the overall concept, is let us get the case tried now as distinguished from we have a right to this particular tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.762" offset="15855009">The question of judge trial in Montana needs to be tempered a little bit by the fact that Montana has an extremely liberal disqualification feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.802" offset="15891163">So we can disqualify for no reason, either side one judge in a criminal case, two in a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.369" offset="15921360">You do not have that same rule in federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.090" offset="15928257">It is tough to get a federal judge disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.780" offset="15939019">Does this mean if we are going to adopt this as part of the constitutional baggage that we know are going to have to be faced with what you can do disqualify a judge if you have a vested right to this judge in a judge trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.452" offset="15989697">I really do not mention to complicate it, but Montana is that way, going back to the wars of the copper kings, it is not hard to get rid of a judge in Montana in either criminal or civil cases and I do not say that disrespectfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.630" offset="16042464">I was seven years on the bench so I just know it is not hard to get rid of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.352" offset="16065347">The only other thing I have to conclude with the argument is I want to pose this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.225" offset="16084783">Suppose in Congress in 1970, in the Criminal Appeals Act had instead of saying until jeopardy attaches had said when the first witness is sworn, would that have been unconstitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.255" offset="16132952">Would we be here today?</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.705" offset="16142774">Supposing Congress today enacts legislation that says in the federal system, jeopardy does not attach until the first witness is sworn or enacts the model penal code, is that unconstitutional and I think to me that that is the crutch of the issue.</text>
