            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79993">We will hear arguments first this morning in 76-944, Nixon against Warner Communication and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.943" offset="119699">Mr. Jeffress.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_jeffress_jr" startTime="13.107" stopTime="210.625">
            <label>Mr. William H. Jeffress, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="13.107" offset="132342">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.856" offset="143314">The tapes that are involved in this case were those that were produced following this Court’s decision for use as evidence in the Watergate trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.745" offset="178945">The question in the case is whether the tapes having served their purpose as evidence in that trial will now be distributed by the clerk of the District Court to members of the public for broadcast, for sale and for whatever other uses that members of the public may wish to put them.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.843" offset="251356">The case started when just prior to the Watergate trial, three news reporters requested Judge Sirica to provide copies of the tapes as they were played to the jury during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.860" offset="295346">Judge Sirica sought the guidance of the chief judge who consulted other members of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.172" offset="320633">It was a consensus of those judges of the District Court that while the ultimate decision ought to be left to the trial judge, providing copies of the tapes to the media would appear first to be inconsistent with the Court’s rule against the broadcast and dissemination of the recording via court reporter of trial proceedings and second, it was the consensus of the judges that dissemination of the transcripts to the public would appear to constitute more than adequate disclosure of what the tapes contain.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.623" offset="458455">Judge Sirica agreed with that consensus and denied the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.890" offset="479457">A few weeks later, but still during the trial, formal applications were filed by the respondents in this case to obtain copies of the tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.692" offset="510700">Those applications were assigned to Judge Gesell of the District Court and were opposed by Mr. Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.504" offset="537972">The clerk of the Court filed an affidavit at the request of Judge Gesell which discussed the feasibility of reproducing the tapes that were played to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.156" offset="580604">The clerk noted that portions of the tapes even of the Court copy of the tapes still remained confidential, that not all of the copy in the custody of the Court had been played to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.834" offset="631281">He concluded though that with sufficient technical assistance and sufficient time, it would possible to reproduce a set of the tapes played to the jury that would be suitable for dissemination to the applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.552" offset="698155">On December 5, Judge Gesell entered a memorandum opinion and order in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.743" offset="718948">He rejected the constitutional claims of the applicants based on the First Amendment, but he did find that there was a practice which he felt was supported by cases of Common Law and by the manual for District Court clerks which supported the claim of the respondents of a right to copy the tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.416" offset="801600">He rejected Mr. Nixon’s position that the tape should not be provided for broadcast under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.552" offset="830125">But he reserved decision on the application, pending the submission of a plan which he felt should number one, show that it would not impose an undue burden on the clerk to make and disseminate the copies and number two it would guarantee that there would be no in his words, over commercialization of the evidence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="210.625" stopTime="215.970">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="210.625" offset="922390">Mr. Jeffress, during these proceedings, the trial was still going on in Judge Sirica’s Court, was it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_jeffress_jr" startTime="215.970" stopTime="342.884">
            <label>Mr. William H. Jeffress, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="215.970" offset="943810">During all of the proceedings that I have described so far, the trial was still going on and Judge Gesell’s December 5th opinion was entered before the trial was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.241" offset="980904">The plan however of the respondents for dissemination of the tapes was submitted in late December and by January 8 when Judge Gesell ruled on the applications, the trial was concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.620" offset="1030432">Judge Gesell denied the applications without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.453" offset="1049763">He stated and again I use his words that it was a prerequisite of any plan that commercialization of the tapes or any undignified use be minimized.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.615" offset="1094380">He felt that no basis for distribution of the tapes that met this goal or that took the burden off the shoulders of the clerk had been submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.766" offset="1138997">After Judge Gesell’s decision, the applications were transferred back to Judge Sirica who by this time was free of his trial duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.272" offset="1177031">After a hearing and obtaining further submissions form the parties, Judge Sirica entered an order which also denied the applications without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.091" offset="1216320">Judge Sirica like Judge Gesell noted that in his opinion, there were many obstacles that must be overcome before any release of the tapes might be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.589" offset="1258324">But the sole issue considered by him at that time was the question of timing of any such release.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.407" offset="1293537">Judge Sirica felt the special qualities of the tapes and the uses that undoubtedly would be made of them should they be released, warranted withholding any dissemination of copies or any decision on whether to disseminate copies until the Appeals Court decided whether retrial could be necessary in the Watergate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.934" offset="1375666">In the Court of Appeals, by the time the case was decided, the convictions in the Watergate case except for that of Mr. Mardian had been affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.897" offset="1411506">The Court of Appeals, however, decided to rule on the ultimate question in the case, that is whether the tapes ought to be provided for broadcast and sale at all.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="342.884" stopTime="355.990">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="342.884" offset="1451526">Mr. Jeffress, you said the ultimate question, but it may not be the ultimate question in the case is varied depending on the stage of other proceedings in the Courts involved?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_jeffress_jr" startTime="355.990" stopTime="475.886">
            <label>Mr. William H. Jeffress, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="355.990" offset="1503875">Your Honor if I understand your question, what I meant by the ultimate question in the case, was whether the tapes, given present circumstances, ought to be disseminated to the press and to members of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.808" offset="1555180">Nothing has happened since that time to change at least what the Court of Appeals stated to be the basis for its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.076" offset="1596244">Now the Court of Appeals decided that there was a Common Law right of access to judicial records that encompassed the right to obtain copies of these tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.775" offset="1627069">It held that the burden was in Mr. Nixon to establish that justice required making an exception to that Common Law principle and third, it concluded that no such showing had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.281" offset="1677015">The Court said that Judge Sirica had abused his discretion and withholding any decision on release of the tapes until the Watergate appeals were decided and paradoxically because Judge Gesell had actually denied the applications, the Court characterized his decision as one in essence affirming his exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.858" offset="1763324">If the Court please, preliminary, I would like to deal with a theme that runs throughout the opinion of the Court of Appeals and the arguments of the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.377" offset="1801462">It said that the tapes are items of extreme historical importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.893" offset="1819539">It said that there is an enormous public desire to hear them.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.971" offset="1835840">It said the broadcast and providing these tapes to the public will make the public better acquainted with our content and the public is and can be now having access only to the transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.209" offset="1888816">We do not take issue with those three propositions, but we do say that they are not properly addressed to a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.918" offset="1915565">The Court has no authority, no power generally to decide what property, whether in the custody of the government or anyone else ought to be broadcast and these tapes are in the Court’s custody solely by virtue of subpoena and solely for use as evidence in the Watergate trial.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="475.886" stopTime="497.709">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="475.886" offset="1983484">Do you say then that even under this Court and the Court of Appeals and the District Courts, presume the housekeeping authority to decide what shall be done with exhibits until they are returned or exhibits that may not be the property of any one individual, it would not have the authority to grant the request of these respondents?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_jeffress_jr" startTime="497.709" stopTime="524.564">
            <label>Mr. William H. Jeffress, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="497.709" offset="2070733">Certainly, Your Honor, the Court has control of the exhibits and has authority to do with them anything that is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which they are in the Court’s custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.743" offset="2110961">It is our position that the relief that is sought here, the effect of releasing them for broadcast is not to serve those purposes and at the interests that are retained and material that is under subpoena should preclude the Court from making that sort of use of the materials.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="524.564" stopTime="539.616">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="524.564" offset="2178148">Would you feel otherwise if these items have not been subpoenaed?</text>
            <text syncTime="529.636" offset="2198524">Do you conceive that then there would be a right to reproduce the tapes as tapes as distinguished from reproducing their contents?</text>

            <text syncTime="539.616" offset="2238439">I do not at all Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.810" offset="2243141">Number one, you would have the case of for example wiretap conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.864" offset="2263412">The person whose voice is wiretapped or is recorded in the course of a wiretap does not own the tape on which that recording is made, but nevertheless, it seems to me that the same considerations that we are arguing here this morning would apply to that and that the Court should not make public broadcast and public release of that tape recording.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="565.701" stopTime="599.114">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="565.701" offset="2342720">But it seems to me that the releasing Court is not deciding as to the propriety or the action ability of the use that may be made of the tape after its release.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.525" offset="2397995">It is simply authorizing the copying of something that is in its custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.590" offset="2422341">If the people who get it out of the custody, use it in a manner that infringes someone’s right of privacy, it may be actionable, but is that a decision that ought to be made by the Court that simply has custody of it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_jeffress_jr" startTime="599.114" stopTime="643.167">
            <label>Mr. William H. Jeffress, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="599.114" offset="2476362">It is your Honor for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.476" offset="2485871">The Court has to make the decision as to whether to provide tapes of its own proceedings or tapes that it obtained from private parties to the public or to the broadcasters with knowledge of the uses that are going to be made of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.663" offset="2534563">This Court’s decisions and one thing we do recognize is that this Court’s decisions under the First Amendment would seriously limit any use, any suit by Mr. Nixon, any suit by any other party to prevent broadcasters from using the items that come into their custody that are released by the Court in any matter they might see it fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.874" offset="2611467">So the only point at which the uses can be controlled is the point at which it is decided whether to put them in the hands of the broadcasters, whether to put them in the hands of the record companies.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="643.167" offset="2652636">But it seems to me, that really puts the cart before the horse, it puts all the constitutional freight really on the custodial court rather than it seems to me, it might be much simpler to just look at this as a problem of custody, copying by Joe Dokes or by NBC of something that is in custody and let the subsequent transactions in connection with the tape carry the constitutional freight?</text>

            <text syncTime="671.164" offset="2764649">Your Honor as I said, number one, our claims do not rest on a constitutional right of not to have the tape disseminated, but as for the subsequent uses that might be made, whether we have a right of privacy or a right of copyright or some cause of action in a Federal Court or in a State Court to prevent those uses is an entirely separate question from whether the Court having obtained property from an individual for limited uses might provide that to other people knowing that those other people, members of the public are going to make uses that are going to be offensive to the person from whom the property was obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.014" offset="2967986">Because if you go on and say for obnoxious purposes then the Court really is going to have to distinguish between one use from another?</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.561" offset="6554181">Some of these tapes are subpoenaed by a Special Prosecutor Cox in 1973 and after the Court of Appeals ordered them to be turned over by Mr. Nixon and after Mr. Cox’s dismissal, they were turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.983" offset="6607889">Others were subpoenaed by Special Prosecutor Jaworski and after this Court’s ruling in 1974, they were turned over.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.940" offset="6675702">All were heard in open Court and be overheard not just by the 12 jurors, Mr. Justice Marshall, but everyone in the Court because everyone that came into the Court was provided with earphones so that they could be heard by everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.820" offset="6731186">The computation in this case is that something in order of 1,300 individuals heard some or all of the tapes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.981" offset="6923866">The clerk of the Court so stated in his affidavit and we have not heard anything contrary from Mr. Nixon nor is there any issue as to Mr. Nixon seeking the return in any sense of these tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.292" offset="6973080">As the reply brief submitted to this Court last week explicitly disclaimed any effort on his part to get these tapes back from the clerk, page 17 of his reply brief and the league of issues as we see that are before this Court are relatively narrow, but before I reach them, I would like to be very clear as to what Judge Gesell held in his opinion or which the Court of Appeals correctly stated it was as it were affirming.</text>

            <text syncTime="4267.792" offset="17151118">That is correct Mr. Justice Marshall, but he did not rule at that time that while the tapes were going to be played in the courtroom and the trial was going to be conducted as publicly as a trial can possibly be, that once that trial was over, there was any right of the public, any interest in the public in obtaining copies of those tapes to do with them whatever the public pleased.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.411" offset="17253622">Now, I would like to mention one other thing as for the manual for District Court clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.970" offset="17271804">It has been our position and we think this is supported by the Common Law cases, the cases that established the Common Law Right, that the Common Law Right is applicable to materials that are the property of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.844" offset="17319346">It said that the manual for District Court clerks provides that in cases of great historical importance, that exhibits are to be retained by the clerk or to become a part of the clerk’s permanent records, but the quotation that is relied on by Judge Gesell by the Court of Appeals and by the respondents is not the correct provision of the manual for District Court clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.704" offset="17410775">The manual in fact recognizes that the clerk should not dispose of documentary exhibits not physically filed with a case that is in the Court jacket and not claimed by parties to the case, that is item number 10 in Chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.875" offset="17475454">In the comment to that, it says that case exhibits impounded by the Court or voluntarily submitted as evidence normally remain the property of parties to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.703" offset="17514742">So the manual does not stand for the proposition that these are part of the traditional Court records that are subject to the Common Law right of inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.809" offset="17551209">As we have said, there is nothing in the purpose of a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.329" offset="17565211">There is nothing in the function of a Court that justifies the Court in so treating them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4412.107" offset="17728320">The tapes are in the custody of the Court for a limited purpose.</text>
