            <label>Mr. Michael Clutter</label>
            <text syncTime="82.141" offset="408683">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.500" offset="418087">This case involves a conviction from the state courts of State of Georgia of two counts of distributing obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.673" offset="450792">The two counts are both predicated upon the same material and involves two exhibitions of the film, “Behind the Green Door,” in the same theater on two different dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.179" offset="488827">The petitioner was tried on these two different counts before a five-person jury pursuant to the authority of a Georgia Constitutional Provision, which we challenge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.542" offset="534280">He was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.517" offset="542221">The judgment of conviction was affirmed in Georgia Court of Appeals and the opinion in judgment which we challenge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.418" offset="569806">There are three arguments on this petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.693" offset="586838">I think in our candor that only two of them are susceptible to any elucidation on oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.702" offset="614946">The third question relates to the obscenity well known of the films involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.341" offset="633440">We certainly do not abandon that argument or anyway retreat from it, but I do not think that could really be expounded upon much in oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.089" offset="664474">We submit that question on the argument submitted in the brief and I would not choose to present any oral argument on the unless the Court asked me any specific questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.809" offset="707315">The other two questions involved are the five-person jury, the constitutionality of the five-person jury before whom the petitioner was tried and the constitutionality of the jury instructions which allowed a conviction on the basis of not only actual knowledge of the materials, but constructive knowledge of the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.035" offset="788294">The five-person jury question was one which was specifically reserved by this Court; five-persons or less was specifically reserved by this Court in Williams v. Florida which approved a six-person jury and said that do not violate the Sixth Amendment Right as applied to the states to the Fourteenth, reserving the question of whether any lesser number might so violate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.448" offset="877947">As is argued in a brief, I think there is just one point that needs emphasis in this case which differentiates it from cases like Williams and that is that we are dealing with a determination of obscenity and we are concerned in this case as not only with whether a five-person jury as equally able to determine guilt or innocence as a six or as a twelve-person, but whether a five-person jury is equally as able to delineate the applicable community standards in the determination of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.427" offset="989855">I think that the sensitive First Amendment arguments here differentiates this case from those like Williams that those are not the values upon which this argument is predicated, but I think they are a separate and distinct line of argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.928" offset="4727873">Both of them Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.337" offset="4733411">They were combined for a joint trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.400" offset="4741666">He was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.033" offset="4744278">He was sentenced to one year under each count that those sentences were driven concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.630" offset="4770609">He was fined, however, 1000$ on each count, so that we have a punishment attaching to each count separately as it relates to the fines, not as it relates to the time to be served however.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.442" offset="4833930">The prosecutor has submitted in his brief that this question has already been answered by the this Court and I think I would just like to state briefly why I think it has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.910" offset="4871756">His main reliance is upon Michigan v. New York and Ginsberg v. New York that involved two different New York Obscenity Statues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.987" offset="4904043">The first of those was Michigan v. New York that involved a question about the petitioner very similar to the question presented here, asked this Court to delineate the constitutionally acceptable minimum standard of scienter because of the very wording of the statute there which was Section 1411 of the New York Statute was fairly similar in authorizing convictions on the basis of constructive knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.126" offset="4992650">However, before that issue was addressed by this Court, the New York Court of Appeals decided People v. Finkelstein which is cited in this Court's opinion in Michigan and the People v. Finkelstein decided that limited the scienter requirement to what this Court described as a very stringent element of scienter and required knowledge and those who were accused, only those were in some manner aware of the character, not should be aware, not were aware of facts and circumstances to put them on notice, but were aware of the content, I mean, of the character of the material are subject to prosecution and it is aim thus not an innocent, even stupidly innocent, but calculated prevalence of a film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.583" offset="5158476">With that limitation on the statute upon Section 1411 of the New York Penal Code, this Court did not reach and specifically says at page 511 of its opinion, it does not have to reach the constitutional minimum that this statute has limited in this way to those who have knowledge is clearly constitutionally acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.867" offset="5239560">That same result was reached in Ginsberg v. New York a couple years later that involved Section 484 of the New York Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.614" offset="5266623">The only difference from that and the original in Michigan case was, 484 dealt with distribution of material which although not obscene when judged against standard of adults, was obscene when judged against the standard of its appeal to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.347" offset="5313538">It was specifically addressed to what today might be called child porn or material which might appeal to children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.567" offset="5342378">That had a scienter requirement again very similar to that before this Court, that was at knowingly means knowledge or reason to know, belief for ground for belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.765" offset="5383129">So I would admit that is very similar to the standard here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.564" offset="5394414">Again, that question was not reached in Ginsberg because again the People v. Finkelstein gloss on the statute was held by this Court to require under that gloss that actual knowledge, those who are in some manner aware of the character of the material were subject to prosecution. With that gloss this again the Court again states at page 644 and 645 in its opinion, it is not necessary to decide whether or not a constructive knowledge requirement is sufficient because in this case there was an actual knowledge requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.874" offset="5507576">Thus neither of those cases reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.442" offset="5521891">The only other case cited by the solicitor in support of his his position in this regard is Rosen v. United States, a 19th century prosecution under the Federal Statutes and in which the Court said the issue was “whether a paper which was mailed as obscene, lewd, insidious and whether it was deposited in the mails by one who knew or had notice of its content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.808" offset="5619380">I think, however, taking in context if you read on from the quotation in the case which is cited by the solicitor, the following phrase is that thus someone can be convicted even though he did not regard it as forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.493" offset="5682074">I think all this really is in Rosen is statement that was repeated by this Court in Hamling that one need not be aware of the legal status of material as obscene and I just wish to repeat the petitioner here does not support that position and does not suggested that this is even necessary to support him in this case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1415.532" offset="5742260">Mr. Clutter, do I understand you to take the position that if the defendant can honestly testify he never saw the movie, just avoided seeing it, is he allowed have a defense?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael Clutter</label>
            <text syncTime="1425.479" offset="5782071">No sir, as stated in here we admit two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.283" offset="5793251">Of course the state certainly has the right to prove knowledge on the basis of circumstantial evidence and as this Court said in Smith that the judicial process and its ability to ascertain prove this not foreclosed by someone's denial that may will be that the jury could find that the defendant knew the contents of the film whether he saw or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.434" offset="5865871">All we submit is that knowledge has to be actual or has to be actual rather than constructive knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.662" offset="5894815">I think that people know a great many things without seeing them and may know the content of material and thus someone who purposely for instance, purposely refuses to view films before showing them could well be held by a jury to say that the reason he refused to look at them was indeed exactly because he knew what was in them and all we are arguing in this case is that may be sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.921" offset="5983840">One other question Mr. Clutter, you explained why Michigan and Hamling are not in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.013" offset="6000141">What's the strongest case supporting your position on the scienter issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.919" offset="6023756">Your Honor as it relates to constructive knowledge I know of none that specifically addressed the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.486" offset="6042041">I think that the wording of Hamling as it goes toward knowledge I think supports the position of the petitioner, but most strongly I think the Smith v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.253" offset="6077150">The reasoning of Smith is equally applicable to this case, although it admittedly to lesser degree that chilling effect may not be as strong if someone who has no scienter requirement and thus cannot distribute any material unless he actually reads it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.922" offset="6123752">What we have here is not a chilling effect that results in the suppression of material which even in the slightest way may allude towards sex scare off the cautious bookseller, the cautious film prevayer until he has actually has personal knowledge of the film or the book he distributes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.459" offset="6193969">Thank you sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="1544.781" offset="6259276">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.097" offset="6280487">My colleague has already expounded on the questions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.554" offset="6294280">I would go right into the five-person jury question and under the Georgia law as authoritatively construed in numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.923" offset="6339837">It has been held that all jurors must return a unanimous verdict whether that be a civil case or a criminal case and irrespective of the size of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.746" offset="6391142">This means that in the case at Bar, the jury was in fact charged that they must return a unanimous verdict and that they must find all of the elements there was a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, so that this means that this jury found that Mr. Ballew in this particular case participated in exhibition of this motion picture that the film was in fact obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.708" offset="6510991">That he knew it was obscene or was aware of facts which would put a reasonable and prudent person on notice as to the suspect nature of the film which under the Georgia Law constitutes a Notice and that he intended to commit the crimes on both occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.339" offset="6605450">Now, how many jurors are necessary to a forward in a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.862" offset="6635543">As already has been discussed, the case of Williams under the Florida, six was held to be sufficient in a case, a felony case where the accused was charged with the offense of robbery, was tried for the offense of robbery and was sentenced to life in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.752" offset="6719135">In the case at Bar the maximum imprisonment is 12 months for each count in misdemeanor offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.312" offset="6809414">Now, in footnote 28 of the majority opinion in the Williams case, it was written, we have no occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.444" offset="6845881">In this case, to determine what minimum number can still constitute a jury, but we do that doubt that six is above that number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.665" offset="6886737">Now, it follows that if six is above the number, five just cannot the below the number.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.061" offset="7496330">In other words, the lesser the seriousness of the offense or the less serious punishment by a smaller jury and the more severe cases by larger jury and that system which the court talked about and apparently approved, provided for the unanimous verdict.</text>
