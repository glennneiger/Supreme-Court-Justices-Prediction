            <text syncTime="51.542" offset="286139">This case involves the statutory scheme of the adoption laws of the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.505" offset="313934">The statutory scheme of adoption laws of the State of Georgia, that presently exist, and of course it should be noted that this is going to change, effective January 01, 1978 provide that, an adoption may be had of a man or child with only the consent of the mother where the child is illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.742" offset="402854">This is contrary to the first paragraph of statute concerning consent, which says that an adoption can only be had with the consent of all living parents.</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Skinner</label>
            <text syncTime="106.151" offset="504523">The old statute does start off with a provision that no adoption can be had of man or children without the concern of living parents, it goes on then to state exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.060" offset="556141">One of the exceptions is, the challenged statute here which is that the consent of a mother alone will suffice if the child is illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.203" offset="600758">This of course has been interpreted by the Georgia Supreme Court in Smith v. Smith to mean that the father must petition to legitimate the child, prior to the filing of any adoption action or he loses the right to legitimate the child, that was applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.469" offset="689783">It was clearly applied because in this case Mr. Quilloin had not filed a petition to legitimate the child prior to the filing of the adoption.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.968" offset="799811">I do not think that that was a specific holding of the trial court.</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Skinner</label>
            <text syncTime="187.023" offset="828023">That is, but I think that that was based upon the conclusions of law that Mr. Quilloin had no standing based upon the challenged statutes which only give standings to object to adoption to the legal father, that is the father who has married the mother or has legitimated the child prior to the filing of the adoption action.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.847" offset="907331">I would like to point out in that regard that in this case, the Appellees married each other in 1967, Darrell then that come to live with the Appellees until 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.973" offset="975772">The adoption action was not filed until 1976, I see no real distinction in saying that the legitimation action is late when the adoption action is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.211" offset="1032823">The adoption action in my opinion was filed purely and simply to eliminate Mr. Quilloin’s rights under the adoption statute of the State of Georgia because I believe that the record is quite clear that apparently Ms. Walcott had contacted counsel and had been advised at that point in time that Mr. Quilloin had no rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.173" offset="1132611">I think, I addressed that issue in my brief as mush as I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.366" offset="1145359">That is true the Georgia statute is concerning birth certificates provide that the father of illegitimate child should not appear on the birth certificate nor or shall, the child had his name, unless he consents to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.864" offset="1199380">It is apparent from the record that Darrell Webster Quilloin has always been Darrell Webster Quilloin and not Darrell Webster Williams which is the maiden name of Ms. Walcott, so he had in fact signed the birth certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.692" offset="1318708">He was with the maternal grandparents part of time, the paternal grand parents part of the time and with the appellate Mr. Quilloin part of the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.128" offset="1368445">And let me point this out too in that regard Darrell has never been a deprived child.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.095" offset="1388298">This is not a case involving what the some people would stereotype type an illegitimate child. Darrell has been loved and cared for by maternal and paternal grand parents, by the mother, by the father and even though it may be somewhat contrary to our position, apparently, the step-father cares for Darrell, but the step-father did not file a petition to adopt Darrell until he had been married to the mother for nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.695" offset="1498743">He could have filed immediately.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.429" offset="1505640">Mr. Skinner on this question of timing, is it not correct that before the trial judge entered his order allowing the adoption and denying the petition to legitimate that he would, if he had concluded that there would have been in the best interest of the child to go with the natural father.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.348" offset="1573349">He could then have legitimated the child?</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.651" offset="7206499">Appellant is here because he contends that the adoption of his child without his consent, violates his due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.964" offset="7239831">We contend that this position is untenable in view of the existence of Georgia Code Section 74-103, which provides that the father of an illegitimate child can legitimate that child at any time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.213" offset="7392804">Since appellant did not take this step and did not legitimate the child he should not be heard to argue that he has been denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.630" offset="7426450">He had an opportunity for this due process for 11 years and did not choose to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.972" offset="7447765">As I stated previously when the child is illegitimate the father’s consent is not required and Georgia Code Section 74-403 states that if the child is illegitimate, only the mother’s consent is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.398" offset="7505548">Appellant has also contended that there is an equal protection violation here, because he says as Georgia law burdens all (Inaudible) fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.088" offset="7540239">Our position is that this is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.475" offset="7553823">There are two classes involved here - fathers of legitimate children and fathers of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.506" offset="7581930">Appellant is in the second class because of his own choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.418" offset="7597604">He could have investigated the situation, gotten an attorney and found out exactly what his rights were and what he needed to do to protect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.699" offset="7630727">Now, there is a distinction made between these two classes, but we would submit that this distinction is made based only a valid state interest, that state interest is Georgia’s interest in the welfare of its children and Georgia’s interest in the protection, and stability of the family unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.995" offset="7699899">In that connection Your Honor, I would like to request that the Court considered the effect of a decision in appellant’s favor and how it would effect adoptions all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.628" offset="7738456">If fathers of illegitimate children, if their consent was required many adoptions which should take place, would not take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.369" offset="7777431">There would be problems of locating the father, there would be problems of the father just not consenting and there would also be the potential problem of profit seeking in order to obtain an adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.758" offset="7830930">We submit that the most important factor here is the best interest of a child.</text>
