            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79996">We will hear arguments next in 76-835, United States against New York Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.417" offset="285632">Mr. Wallace, you may precede when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="55.014" stopTime="389.255">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="55.014" offset="300052">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.642" offset="314471">The issue in this case is the validity of an order authorizing FBA -- FBI Agents to install and use Pen Registers, as these devices are commonly called, on two designated telephones and ordering the respondent telephone company to furnish all information, facilities and technical assistance needed to install the Pen Registers unobtrusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.815" offset="443203">The order was based on a finding of probable cause to believe that certain named individuals and others unknown were conducting an illegal gambling enterprise in violation of Federal Law by the use of the two designated telephones at a certain address specified in the order and these findings were based on an affidavit by an FBI Agent showing the reasons for believing this information to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.518" offset="590011">The sufficiency of that affidavit and of the order's specificity and reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment are not disputed here, indictments have since been returned with respect to this investigation and motions to suppress have been denied, it is in that preceding that such issues would be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.156" offset="708607">Now, the order itself appears in the Appendix at pages 6 and 7 preceded by the affidavit incidentally, the order has considerable particularity in Fourth Amendment terms and it contains a couple of provisions to which I want to draw a particular attention, one is at page 7 at the Conclusion of the first paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.658" offset="834621">The order specifies that the telephone company is to be compensated for -- at the prevailing rates for providing the facilities and technical assistance required and the other is in the next where for Clause part B, the purpose of the orders specified here, it is to ascertain by the -- identifying outgoing calls, the numbers that are dialed in outgoing calls, to identify Associates and Confederates of those who prior to investigation, including a prior authorized wire tap indicated were involved in this enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.025" offset="1044019">And this is for purposes in looking at the outgoing calls of ascertaining the scope of the gambling conspiracy where it is that bets maybe being laid off as the expression is when they may receive more in the way of particular bets than they can handle than confederates, other gambling enterprises will be called to see if they can take a portion of the bet and this is an investigative technique to indicate the scope of the gambling conspiracy and that was the purpose of what was involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.810" offset="1219144">Now the Pen Registered Devices themselves are familiar to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.235" offset="1240878">They were involved in the case of United States against Giordano and the District Court there described in some detail, how they operate and what they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.276" offset="1301064">They disclose only the telephone numbers that are dialed from the telephone to which line the device is attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.003" offset="1347980">In the absence of some further attachments to the Pen Registered Device which are, were not authorized by this order, the Pen Register does not indicate whether any conversation is occurring over the line, let alone hear any conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.945" offset="1419764">It does not indicate whether as a result of the dialing.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.782" offset="1435124">There is a ring or a busy signal at the other end.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.125" offset="1448394">How many rings?</text>
            <text syncTime="343.281" offset="1453096">Whether the telephone was answered?</text>
            <text syncTime="345.313" offset="1461247">None of that can be ascertained by means of the use of what was authorized by this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.304" offset="1497191">So, essentially the information that is received, is nothing different from what can be secured from telephone company records to the extent that they are maintained of a telephone toll calls or a message unit billing records, for long distance calls every telephone company has records that can be secured without any showing of probable cause by a Grand Jury subpoena.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.662" offset="2282641">The purpose of my comparison is merely to point out the very limited nature of the information that can be ascertained through the use of these devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.111" offset="2332378">Many generalizations that are heard about the evils of electronic surveillance are not responsive to the limited authorization, limited investigatory technique that is involved here which gives you nothing more than what you can get from the telephone company with respect to long distance calls, whatever the situation is with respect to local calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.121" offset="2432479">It is hard to see why there is a Constitutional difference between local and long distance calls for these purposes and those records, that is not contested, would be available under this Court’s decision that is analogous to this in United States against Miller with respect to bank records and more specifically the Second Circuit Court of Appeals some years ago addressed this question in a case cited in brief called United States against Gallo, a panel consisting of the two judges, Hand and Judge Swan who wrote the opinion, holding that the evidence was competent, taken from the telephone company by subpoena, showing calls between a telephone in the appellant’s home and telephones registered in the names of certain codefendants who pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.072" offset="2684195">It was of limited probative value because it shows nothing, but the existence of such calls, but it was admissible and the admission was upheld and the Court explained there, that this was not a violation of Section 605 of the Communications Act which at that time forbade the telephone company or anyone else from disclosing the contents of wire communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.677" offset="2810628">The Statute they held, I wish I had known about this in connection with United States against Miller, I wish I had known about this case, the Statute was not intended to prescribe long standing reasonable business practices of communication companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.225" offset="2868829">When a person takes up a telephone, he knows that the company will make or may make some kind of a record of the event and he must be deemed to consent to whatever record the business convenience of the company requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.674" offset="2926612">If by any stretch of the language of Section 605 which no longer applies in this area, the making of such a record could be termed as interception of the communication, it is one which the sender has authorized, hence it is not within the ban of the Statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.259" offset="4524992">There are pictures, I do not know, precisely, but the point is that the FBI made a 4-day surveillance of the neighborhood knowing that counter surveillance techniques were being used by this gambling enterprise which had a history, the record shows, of changes of address and changes of telephone numbers quite frequently and they concluded that they could not execute the warrant unobtrusively without the leased line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.414" offset="4661560">Sending agents into string the lines there would have resulted in cessation of the gambling activities and frustration of the Court’s order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.321" offset="4721224">So, in the meantime, the telephone company filed a motion in the case seeking vacation of that part of the order requiring them to provide facilities and that order was denied in all respects by the District Court, but granted by the Court of Appeals in a two to one decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.593" offset="4814324">The majority agreeing with the Court of Appeals with the Seventh Circuit in a prior decision, and since then the Eighth Circuit has also agreed with this, held that the District Court did have authority to authorize the FBI to install the Pen Register and it assumed arguendo that there was also authority that inherently or under the All Writs Act to require the telephone company to provide the assistance to enable that order to be carried out, but it held that it would be an abuse of discretion in the absence of Specific Legislative Authority on this subject how it exercised that authority on the basis of what might be called the first step down to slippery slope kind of rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.773" offset="5043052">What is significant for our purposes in the opinion, it can be found in Paragraph on Pages 13a and 14a of the Appendix to the Petition in which the Court of Appeals specifies that what it calls the most persuasive point argued by the government in support of the order is that without the appellant’s technical aid, the order authorizing the use of a Pen Register will be worthless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.065" offset="5180247">Federal Law Enforcement Agents simply cannot implement Pen Register surveillance without the telephone company’s help.</text>

            <text syncTime="1480.368" offset="6001433">What remains here are the question about the validity of the order with respect to the authorization itself which we think Rule 41 applies to, has it seems to us the Court of Appeals assumed in Katz and Osborne with respect to seizure of intangible and electrical impulses of this sort or since it sometimes referred to as an order in the nature of a search warrant, one could instead resort to Rule 57 (b) of the Criminal Rules, which authorizes the District Court to proceed in any manner not prohibited elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.515" offset="6218040">But either way, the protections of the Fourth Amendment are satisfied in this area and the rule with some adaptation because it does not specify, it is not drafted in terms of a durational search of the sort that is involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.620" offset="7182376">New York telephone company is pleased that the Court has granted certiorari in this case to resolve the -- to provide guidance and to resolve the conflict that exists in the Circuits as to the right of the government to proceed to get the orders for the installation of Pen Registers and to order the Affirmative Assistance of the telephone company, when it has not chosen to proceed under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.213" offset="7308809">We of course have no desire to obstruct law enforcement authorities in the discharge of their vital functions and in fact we have a long history of extensive cooperation in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.844" offset="7363353">At the same time, we also have a long standing policy of protecting the privacy of communications to the maximum extent that is feasible with the needs of a law enforcement when those exceptions are spelled out by clear requirements of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.199" offset="7444750">While we believe, we do have a legitimate concern with potential Civil Liability if the orders that are here sought are not lawful and there have been a of number cases in which the telephone companies have been sued because we are sort of in the middle in this kind of situation, nevertheless our primary purpose for being here and in cooperating in bringing this matter before the Court is because of its implications for the Protection of the privacy of communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.510" offset="7589991">Given the extent to which the telephone system is used for social and business intercourse in this country, we believe it is inconsistent with the rights of a free society to have the privacy invaded anymore than it is found to be warranted by the clear definitions and exceptions in the Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.113" offset="7688420">This Court and Congress have long been concerned with balancing these two interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.446" offset="7857694">And Title III of that Act deals very extensively with the whole matter of electronic surveillance and we believe that the senate report indicates that Congress intended to legislate comprehensively and preemptively that in the area of electronic surveillance --</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3905.848" offset="15703310">I have three brief points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.426" offset="15717625">In the first place, even though the telephone company is here challenging the authority to issue the warrant under Rule 41, it did comply in part, it did everything that was required of it under the warrant except the leasing of the line and it well might have felt some obligation to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.755" offset="15802994">It is not standing here in the shoes of an ordinary third party, an innocent bystander.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.774" offset="15827026">It is not only as a public utility, but there is a finding of probable cause to believe that its facilities, which it is operating for a profit or being used in the conduct of an enterprise violating the Criminal Law in the circumstances where it would be very difficult to conduct the enterprise without the use of the telephone company’s facilities and that matter should not be lost sight of, when arguments are made, generalizing about bystanders and whether Courts can impose duties on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.508" offset="15957952">The second point is, that Title III, not only does the legislative history specifically disclaim that it is intended to limit the use of Pen Registers, but if Title III were to be applied in this area, it would be a very serious interference with legitimate use of Pen Registers in criminal investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.989" offset="16071950">Title III, because it deals with wire tapping, overhearing the contents of telephone communications is very restricted, not only are there conversant procedures to follow which are quite time consuming, but the list of crimes for which it can be used is quite limited, whereas Pen Registers can be very useful in the investigation of a escaped fugitive offenses, Civil Rights Act offenses and various others that we have mentioned in the footnote in our brief that are not covered by Title III.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.594" offset="16206324">Since we here complied with all the requirements that would be necessary in order to be able to get a search warrant, to go into someone’s premises and search through his papers, there is no reason to limit a far less intrusive investigatory technique which can be very useful in these areas of detecting criminal activity and finally (Voice Overlap)</text>

            <text syncTime="4085.930" offset="16423663">There is a provision in Title XVIII, Section 3105 which indicates that when needed, persons can be required to help in the execution of a search warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="4104.645" offset="16498478">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.477" offset="16501821">That is the kind of help that I am speaking of and we frequently do get that kind of help when someone is operating a facility for profit and that facility is being used in furtherance of criminal enterprise, at least there is a probable cause to believe that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.743" offset="16566918">My final point is, what about the absence of action by Congress here other than its indication and the legislative history of Title III, that the use of Pen Registers is not to be restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.902" offset="16627523">The contention of the telephone company in effect is that in the absence of action by Congress, the telephone company rather than the Court is to decide whether an order of this kind can be carried out when the telephone company’s facilities are needed, but I think that the jurisprudence of this Court is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.779" offset="16723026">Of course, Congress is free to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.288" offset="16733057">There is a case sited at page 18a of the Appendix to the petition for certiorari by Judge Mansfield in his dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.126" offset="16772450">In the middle of the page, there is a quotation from, this is page 18a, there is a quotation from this Court’s opinion in Adams v. United States ex rel.McCann, in which a unanimous Court speaking through Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it was unanimous on this point, upheld the authority of the Court of Appeals to issue a Writ Habeas Corpus in circumstances where the Court of Appeals concluded that there were obstacles to the taking of a pro se appeal that warranted using Habeas Corpus for review.</text>

            <text syncTime="4212.090" offset="16928349">Well, they split on the merits, but they were unanimous that it was proper for the Court of Appeals in that case to use the extraordinary writ and the point that I want to make is that the quotation that appears in the middle of the page there leaves out the first part of the sentence, but the first part of the sentence by a careful judicial craftsman, speaking on behalf of the Court, reads, “unless appropriately confined by Congress, a Federal Court may etc.,”the idea is that in the absence of action by Congress, there is power in the Courts and it should be exercised in order to effectuate the Court’s orders and if Congress wants to specify another method of preceding, that of course is part of the legislative authority and that is one reason why we think it is more respectful of that authority to rely on the All Writs Act rather than a concept of inherent power which some of the Court of Appeals had preferred in this area, but there is no reason to think that in the absence of action by Congress, someone other than the Court should decide whether these warrants should be effectuated.</text>
