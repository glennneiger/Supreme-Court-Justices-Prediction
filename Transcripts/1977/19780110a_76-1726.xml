            <label>Mr. Carl J. Schumacher, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="86.504" offset="425959">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.090" offset="448320">I appear for Mobil Oil Corporation, the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.501" offset="469949">The facts that bring us to this point in this suit are really simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.991" offset="503908">Indeed I do not believe that any facts are in dispute at this stage of these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.748" offset="542883">On August 15, 1967 four men were killed when a helicopter in which they were riding crashed into the Gulf of Mexico after leaving a fixed platform not official island, and returning toward the shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.741" offset="634938">The crash occurred some 100 miles off the Louisiana Coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.939" offset="667748">The case was tried in the District Court on three theories by the plaintiffs seeking a remedy for death damages based upon Death on the High Seas Act, damages under the Jones Act, and damages under the General Maritime Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.888" offset="763461">The issue before this Court and the sole issue is whether or not this Court in Moragne to use Judge Brown's language consigned the Death on the High Seas Act to the briney deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.686" offset="846635">Did this Court by Moragne reduce the Death on the High Seas Act to the scrappy or reduce it to the level of a nonstatutory restatement as Professors Gilmore and Black have said, suggested a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.049" offset="960111">Our submission is that clearly Justice Harlan in the opinion in Moragne did not intend to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.603" offset="1018311">We submit that it is clear beyond any possibility or doubt that this Court in Moragne did not decide more than it had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.417" offset="1069616">And when Justice Harlan wrote we conclude that the Death on the High Seas Act was not intended to preclude the availability of a remedy for wrongful death under General Maritime Law in situations not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.263" offset="1137012">We specifically decline or this Court specifically decline to, by Moragne, repeal or nullify a circumvent DOHSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.866" offset="1203363">The case comes before Your Honors because of the conflict in the opinions of the First Circuit in Barbe versus Drummond and of the Fifth Circuit in Law versus Sea Drilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.920" offset="1311614">Question arises because the Fifth Circuit in the instant case, the Panel of the Fifth Circuit that heard Higginbotham et al. decided that it was precluded from deciding for itself whether or not Moragne nullified the Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.064" offset="1432195">It said it was precluded by its own rules that required it to follow the decision of an earlier panel in the Law case.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.361" offset="1465423">In Law, Judge Brown speaking for the Fifth Circuit says no longer does one need a state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.663" offset="1510563">No longer does one need a State Court or the admiralty as a Court or DOHSA as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.982" offset="1543895">There is a federal maritime cause of action but death on navigable waters -- any navigable waters -- and it can be enforced in any court.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="376.688" offset="1586736">By any navigable waters he was, of course, including the three mile --</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl J. Schumacher, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="382.068" offset="1608261">He was including Your Honor the three mile limit which clearly there was good authority for him to do so, but the facts in Law involve deaths beyond the three mile limit as did the facts in Barbe versus Drummond.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.974" offset="1675866">The First Circuit addressing itself to the identical question, came to just the opposite conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.210" offset="1732813">The Court in Barbe said, "Since DOHSA clearly provides a cause of action for wrongful death in this case, we fail to see how Moragne applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.388" offset="1781505">We hold that the major of damage for wrongful death provided by DOHSA, namely pecuniary loss, controls in the instant case."</text>
            <text syncTime="438.414" offset="1833645">Both the petitioner and the respondent, in the briefs before the Court, have addressed themselves to the intention of the Congress in passing the Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.644" offset="1898533">I submit to Court that the statute itself demonstrates that the Congress intended that the Death on the High Seas Act be the exclusive remedy for death actions occurring or where death occurs more than three miles out of the territorial waters of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.501" offset="1989962">It reached whenever the death of a person shall because by wrongful act neglect the default occurring on the high seas beyond the Marine League from shore, the personal representatives of the decedent may maintain a suit for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.114" offset="2060388">But the damages provision which is the provision which bars directly on the Higginbotham case provides the recovery in such suit shall be a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained, and whether our reading of the congressional record in 1920 is correct and we properly understand the intention of the Congress, or whether that suggested by the respondents is may be debatable, but the language of the statute certainly cannot be debated and the statute says that the major of damages shall be the pecuniary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.229" offset="2276891">There is no exception to that command.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.885" offset="2339480">I suppose Your Honors that the petitioner's argument really reduces itself to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.578" offset="2374275">We feel that in Moragne the Court correctly limited itself to consideration of deaths occurring within the three mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.057" offset="2424117">We feel that it did not signal or suggest as the Fifth Circuit in Law guessed that the Moragne decision applied beyond the three mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.661" offset="2490573">On the contrary, we believe that the statute itself mandates that it apply exclusively to Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.802" offset="2555147">But the Moragne Gaudet remedy is to be applied beyond the three mile limit would be to totally emasculate the act of a Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.626" offset="2610422">Your Honors that is what I have come here to say if any member of the Court has question of course I would be glad to try to speak to.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.774" offset="2663085">You have not talked a great deal about the Gaudet case, as I remmeber the name of it, understandably, when one reads that opinion it seems to read -- it does not seem to be limited in its language to the territorial waters although the whole I know the facts there roles within the territorial waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.948" offset="2767784">Your Honor I believe in Footnote 22 of Gaudet, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Brennan, committed error.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.964" offset="2831836">I believe the construction placed by the majority in Gaudet on the Death on the High Seas Act was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.155" offset="2880529">I do not think that really germane to our case because I think Gaudet should have been limited by rules of interpretation to the facts of Gaudet.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.241" offset="3188878">So coming from that background and reading the Death on the High Seas Act I am knowing that this case involved the deaths that indeed occurred on the high seas as defined by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.884" offset="3251467">I suppose that, I would say QED, but in effect I do not believe the Gaudet footnote or the Gaudet decision itself is necessary for the decision in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="964.950" offset="3939742">I wanted to point out to the Court in the very beginning that my client Mrs. Shinn one of the respondents, her decedent was entitled to the benefits of the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, and the General Maritime Law as found by the District Court and affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, as distinguished from Mrs. Higginbotham whose decedent was not found to be a seaman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1118.030" offset="4552052">Counsel for the petitioner pointed out and this Court has accepted the question of review as to whether or not the Moragne cause of action replaces completely the Death on the High Seas Act, or whether or not it is necessary to relegate it to the briney deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.129" offset="4648496">We believe that the real issue is not whether that the Moragne cause of action replaces a statutory Act of Congress but whether or not it can recognize as the Court we think did in Moragne case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.148" offset="4712548">The existence of a cause of action for wrongful death under the General Maritime Law which can augment, complement, and supplement the existing federal statutes, and we ask the Court to consider that its decision in Moragne did just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.215" offset="4788826">In overruling the Harrisburg, the Court must reflect back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.903" offset="4803559">The Harrisburg a case in the late 80's and 80's was cited for the proposition that there was no cause of action for wrongful death under the General Maritime Law wherever the wrongful death occurred so long as the death occurred within waters under federal jurisdiction, both within and without the three mile limit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.535" offset="5482115">Now this Court combed the legislative history of the Death on the High Seas Act in Moragne case, and I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go through all of the ramification, but I really point to what was noted in Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.673" offset="5542615">When the petitioner read to you the provisions of the Act, petitioner omitted this portion of the statute which says that the provisions of any state statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected by this chapter and this language resulted after great debate on the floor of the House, where there was some language in this amendment which restricted the state statutes to territorial limits and that language was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.180" offset="5692662">So we believe this Act was passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.189" offset="5708649">It was really to confer a jurisdiction in Federal Court which had not existed before 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.613" offset="5746370">It was not a grade of exclusive jurisdiction because those statutes, which had been passed by the state which could have applied to the High Seas were still permitted to by the very language in the statute that I just read to the Court.</text>
