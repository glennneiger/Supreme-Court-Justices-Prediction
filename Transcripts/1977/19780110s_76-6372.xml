            <text syncTime="12.142" offset="128468">This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.959" offset="151769">At issue is the constitutionality of Georgia's adoption laws as applied to deny an unwed father authority to lead to adoption of his illegitimate child.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.447" offset="197745">Under Georgia law child born out of wedlock can be adopted with the consent of the mother alone, unless the father has legitimated the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.731" offset="234839">In this case the appellant, the unwed father of the illegitimate child who had been in the custody of its mother since birth, objected to the doctrine of child by the mother's husband and sought legitimation and formal visitation rights at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.979" offset="299832">After full hearing of which appellants were allowed to present evidence, all matters included to fitness as a parent, the trial court granted the adoption and denied legitimation and visitation rights on the ground that the outcome was in the best interest of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.211" offset="372765">The Judge of Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.932" offset="383632">An opinion filed with the clerk we hold that the Georgia statute as applied in this case, did not deprive appellant, a Due Process or a Equal protection, a power to the substantive rights under the Due Process clause, was certified by the application of the best interest of the child and that standard following the evidentiary hearing, appellant solely protection claimed that the state was required to treat him the same as a divorced father as without marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.460" offset="501810">Since appellant never shouldered any significant responsibility for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.313" offset="529187">According to the judgment of supreme court of Georgia is affirmed.</text>
