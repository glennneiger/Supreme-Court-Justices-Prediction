            <text syncTime="985.081" offset="4020292">The State of Arkansas here would submit that there are really, but two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.077" offset="4040250">The first is whether in fact a conflict of interest did exist here, and the second or broader issue is if the issue of conflict arises who bears the responsibility for making that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.249" offset="4128962">The Glasser decision of this Court in 1942 merely stated that ineffective assistance of counsel was given where an attorney was representing conflicting interest and the majority of jurisdictions in this country have held that it is not an imaginary conflict that is spoken off, but that it must be shown that there is in fact some real conflict, something more than a possibility of conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.520" offset="4273993">The State of Arkansas submits that the defense counsel here submitted a petition for separate counsel that stated merely that the ?possibility? of conflict existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.188" offset="4332717">Prior to trial, the trial Court held a hearing on this motion in an effort to ascertain what if any conflict existed?</text>

            <text syncTime="1118.030" offset="4552041">The defendants were not precluded any defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.686" offset="4570640">They all alleged alibi defenses that were certainly not inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.777" offset="4599061">They testified to this effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.045" offset="4660083">Now, the defense counsel has set forth some very nice standards dealing with confidentiality and lawyer confidences, but it seems to me that he overlooks the fact that number one - this case in particular involved no conflict, that he very easily could have outlined to the trial court, the general nature of the conflict and did not have to divulge confidential information to the court in order to show that a conflict existed, but apparently the defense counsel never made that impression or conveyed that to the court and the state would certainly submit that there was no conflict that existed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.968" offset="4859763">Counsel made a great deal of the fact that he was unable to cross-examine his witnesses.</text>
