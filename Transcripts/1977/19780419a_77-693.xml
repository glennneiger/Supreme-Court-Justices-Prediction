            <text syncTime="31.368" offset="205374">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.127" offset="224391">The petitioner in this case, the Hon.Hubert L.Will is the United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.512" offset="253962">As this Court knows, he is one of our most distinguished trial judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.943" offset="275695">He has been asked on a number of occasions to address the seminars conducted by the Judicial Center for newly appointed United States district judges to instruct them.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.996" offset="331911">In the 1971-1971 volume, he summarized the basic assumptions upon which Trial Courts work as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.224" offset="372871">The objective and responsibility of our legal system is to produce the highest quality of justice in the shortest time and at the lowest cost consistent therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.276" offset="429086">Justice, particularly the highest quality is unique in each case must be handcrafted by the most skilled artisans available, each case tailored to its own characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.422" offset="477674">The production of justice is essentially a job shop as distinguished from a mass production operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.721" offset="510797">This case is a case which tests whether that standard will continue to be applied to the work of United States District Judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.718" offset="554788">The petition granted by this court was to review a mandamus of a panel of the Seventh Circuit requiring Judge Will to proceed to try a case immediately despite the fact that in his judgment, the particular case should not be tried but should be stayed because the same parties had the same issues pending before a State Court in a prior pending proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.424" offset="685609">Every issue was identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.002" offset="695953">It was clear to him that it would be the most wasteful and duplicate of exercise for him to proceed to act.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.542" offset="1094059">If I may, I would like to present to the Court the facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.502" offset="1117988">The Calvert Insurance Company is a Baltimore, Maryland Insurance company that engaged in conversations with the American Reinsurance Corporation which ran a reinsurance pool for casualty insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.426" offset="1181622">As of January 1st , 1974, the Calvert Company joined the pool which consisted of 99 other insurance companies to reinsure casualty risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.253" offset="1240972">That took place in January of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.482" offset="1253824">In early April, two events took place which the parties are contesting before Judge Will.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.154" offset="1284544">One is that a series of tornadoes occurred in the Middle West and that the insurance publication said that re-insurers would be called ?murdered?.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.590" offset="1342327">Also in early April 1973, the financial statements of the reinsurance pool for the year 1973 became available.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.082" offset="1400215">Late April, the Calvert Company said we have been misled by the information we have been given as to the previous years functioning of this pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.445" offset="1445668">It is regarded by us as material and we believe we are entitled to cancel this agreement as of the day we entered into January 1st, 1974 and avoid liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.338" offset="1505331">After some discussion, the parties agreed that Calvert would be excused after the year 1974 but the pool insisted that it was liable for the year 1974 and brought suit in a State Court, the 99 insurance companies members to the pool, sued the Calvert Company and said we want a declaratory judgment that Calvert is responsible for the losses which appeared to be likely the result in the pool.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.642" offset="1754539">Calvert by reason of diversity said, it could have removed the case to the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.093" offset="1776273">It did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.900" offset="1783483">It filed various motions in the State Court and then on January 10th, 1975, six months later, it filed denials, answers and counterclaims in the State Court and denials, answers and counterclaims were that membership in this pool was a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.927" offset="1879614">That the security had been sold to them one, in violation of the 1933 Securities Act, in violation of Rule 10b-5 of the 34A.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.924" offset="1919633">This was by way of an affirmative defense that had been sold in violation of the Illinois Securities law that had been sold in violation of the Maryland Securities Law and also there are certain additional defenses that the American people did not have the right to sue and that there was a violation of the Illinois insurance statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.182" offset="2012629">On the very same day, a complaint was filed in the Federal Court and the complaint in the Federal Court tracked exactly what the affirmative defenses were in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.482" offset="2069890">In other words count one, in the Federal Court was Securities Act of 1933 as the first affirmative defense was.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.311" offset="2101132">Count two was violation of 10b-5 of 34 A, that was affirmative defense two.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.774" offset="2127046">Count three was the Illinois Securities Law affirmative defense three.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.611" offset="2142406">Count four was the Maryland Securities Law, affirmative defense four.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.164" offset="2160587">Count five Common Law being misled that was affirmative defense five.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.769" offset="2187023">There were two additional affirmative defenses which were not reflected in the federal complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.487" offset="2205831">It was an absolute mirror image.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.680" offset="2222654">The federal suit asked with respect to 10b-5 which is the essential thing that in the state court suit, the relief requested on the 10b-5 count was that there should be rescission of the pool's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.475" offset="2309798">In the Federal Court, the claim was there should be rescission identical or in the alternative for $2 million damages and that is the difference between the federal complaint and the state complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.100" offset="2380329">The proceedings were brought before Judge Will and a motion to stay was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.140" offset="2404466">Judge Will said, this is a perfect case for a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.959" offset="2423797">The parties have a course of action pending before the State Court, it had been filed six months before.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.198" offset="3696691">It said we recognize in this Circuit, in exactly identical circumstances Aetna State Bank against Altheimer is a case of a 10b-5 claim in Federal Court, parallel with the state claim of the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.325" offset="3757191">We recognize that the Federal District Courts have discretion and that is the rule that we apply and what Judge Will did in this case was perfectly correct in accordance with our rule and we follow Landis against North American opinion by Mr. Justice Cardozo and that is the rule in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.864" offset="3839424">However, since Judge Will ruled, the Supreme Court of the United States has decided the Colorado River case and Indian Water Rights case and we believe that we are obliged by the rulings of the Supreme Court to reverse our findings in Altheimer, to reverse our adherence to Judge Cardozo's opinion in Landis against North American and to say that the District Courts have no discretion whatsoever that whenever a case raising a federal claim is presented to them, they must try the case and that we direct Judge Will immediately to try the case, we say our own Altheimer case based on the Landis case is overruled and reversed as no longer the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.194" offset="4044747">Four of the active judges thought that was such a remarkable ruling and such a misconstruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.769" offset="4119039">We say that plainly the Seventh Circuit panel misconstrued the Colorado River case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.552" offset="4150177">It was a case in which this Court was motivated by the same considerations of judicial economy by which Judge Will is motivated, that is was a specific case as to the construction of the McCarran Amendment and both majority and dissenting judges in that case proceeded from different views as to what was judicial economy but in both cases, the Supreme Court said we are concerned with conservation of judicial resources and in fact, on two occasions, the Colorado River Case cited Landis against North American which the Seventh Circuit panel felt had been overruled by Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.818" offset="4331258">We say that if the decision below is not vigorously rejected by this Court, it will encourage wasteful and duplicate of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.278" offset="4373054">It will make much more difficult efficient, low cost, high quality justice and that is why Judge Will insisted on taking this case up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.233" offset="4428851">The Department of Justice has a rule that they will not represent judges when private lawsuits are involved in mandamus cases and they suggested that he retain private counsel and he has done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.860" offset="4487366">It is because of his devotion to the swift and economical administration of justice and its feeling that the necessity of having a ruling from this Court that applies not only to him and not only to this case but to all other cases to show that this Court did not mean in the Colorado River case what the Seventh Circuit panel felt it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.350" offset="4597289">This case is consequently not the most important aspect of the matter but I would like to examine it to show what can happen if this kind of thing is allowed to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="1193.875" offset="4855483">In other words, if there were a false statement or a misleading statement that was material, it would be a defense in the state proceedings as a matter of Common Law even without the requirements of intent to deceive, scienter required by Ernest case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.042" offset="4944090">So that they had a perfect defense if they were in fact misled, even innocently by the pool people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.346" offset="4981289">In other words, if the earnings of the pool were material and they had been misstated and they were misled by that and till joining the pool, they were home free. On the other hand, no matter how many times the Court decides that a security is at involved, that does not help them because they have to prove that a false statement was made, that it was material, that they are relying upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.449" offset="5089749">So the question which has been presented by this reactive federal lawsuit has nothing to do with the merits of the case, it will not dispose off it for or against Calvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.860" offset="5143353">The sole issue which is involved is were they misled or were they not misled?</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.526" offset="5174073">But because of this running back and forth between the Federal and the State Courts, we stand now at a situation in terms of swift and efficient justice where four years almost after the lawsuit was filed in the State Court, nothing has happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.058" offset="5288175">He said I will not have any part to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.368" offset="5297370">I will stand aside and I will let the State Courts decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.448" offset="5317746">But because the Court of Appeals panel in this case, saw it differently and they felt that this Court had obliged them to overrule what they regarded as a correct exercise of discretion and they have said that this Court had compelled them to deprive District Courts of the jurisdictions that they had previously been thought to have under Justice Cardoza?s opinion in the North American case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.258" offset="5445015">It is most important that this Court correct those deficiencies, announce that it does recognize the necessity of District Courts shaping remedies on a handcrafted basis as Judge Will said, for the purpose of seeing to it that justice is provided economically and without unnecessary delay and it is for that reason that we are here and that Judge Will desires a ruling from this Court that his Colorado River decision has been misconstrued, that the rule of Landis against North American remains the law and that he and his fellow district judges throughout the country have the kind of discretion that is necessary to see that efficient judicial process occurs and that justice is not unduly delayed by complicating and duplicated ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.221" offset="6516766">Let me start, if I may with a brief description of the statutory provisions on jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.448" offset="6545710">I do not want to go through the facts again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.373" offset="6553442">I would like to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.018" offset="6563996">Under all of the SEC statutes, except the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Federal and State Courts are given concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.539" offset="6602135">For some reason, Congress in the 34 Act said the Federal Courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all violations of this act at all suits in equity or actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.399" offset="6673501">So that it is impossible to bring a 10b-5 action as the famous fraud rule under the Exchange Act which had been taking over the universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.510" offset="6701922">It is impossible to bring such an action in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.719" offset="6714775">Now then, if 'x' sues 'y' for breech of contract or for declaratory judgment in the State Court and 'y' has the defense based on rule 10b-5, obviously the State Court must entertain and decide the defense under the Supremacy Clause.Otherwise it might be giving a judgment under state law when there is a perfectly good federal defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.950" offset="6815712">However, that in a sense as I suggest in our brief is an imperfection in our federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.620" offset="6842461">It is a necessary imperfection in our federal system to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.206" offset="6856776">It does not follow that when 'x' sues 'y' in the State Court for let us say breech of contract or in this case since the alleged brief was anticipatory over the declaratory judgment action, it does not follow that when 'x' sues 'y' in the State Court under state law and 'y' has a 10b-5 defense and a 10b-5 counterclaim because when Section 27 of the Exchange Act says exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court, it says over all actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.862" offset="6963356">Not just actions for damages, actions for rescission as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.457" offset="6977775">So it does not follow that when the State Court defendant moves into the Federal Court expeditiously as a Federal plaintiff for rescission, forget the damages for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.954" offset="7015705">Let us assume there are not any, for rescission in the Federal Court, it does not follow, but in that case, the Federal Court should go out of its way and ignore the exclusive jurisdiction that Congress mandated and stay its hands indefinitely while the State Court tries the whole case so that when it gets back to the Federal Court, unless of course we went on the fraud charge as a Common Law but why should we be put to all of that litigation when we have federal claims and defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.978" offset="7127823">It does not follow that in that case, the Federal Courts would sit on its hands indefinitely until all the State Courts finish and the case gets back to the Federal Court at which time, the only decision left is res judicata or collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.880" offset="7191457">That is a rather strange way to exercise the exclusive jurisdiction that Congress gave to the Federal Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.939" offset="9639653">The fact that we could get complete relief by successfully defending on one ground or another including the Federal ground in the State Court should not deprive us of our right to have a Federal Court determine our action, our action for rescission, 27 says, ?All actions?.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.237" offset="9712900">So the first proposition is that we start with the idea abstention and so on is an exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="2470.459" offset="9961795">I have answered that one I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.172" offset="9968587">It is true, but we prefer to litigate the way Congress said we had the right to litigate by being an action for rescission in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.659" offset="10002546">Mind you when we brought that nothing had happened on the State side except that we had filed a motion to the effect that, that state action should have been on the equity side because it reported to be a class action and that was overruled and there was an exchange of correspondence about discovery, but nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.627" offset="10058448">The same day, on which we filed an answer on the State side, we filed the action on the Federal side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.136" offset="10092512">Then my brother Freeman says that Calvert does not need 10b-5 we have this State Law defense and everything else we did he says is a bunch of irrelevant questions, raises irrelevant questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.706" offset="10142771">Well, I suggest that with all respect these are not irrelevant questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.827" offset="10163251">We chose other defenses and other claims which Congress gave us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.415" offset="10189583">For example, if we satisfy the Courts some day that there is security here there will be nothing left to litigate except the summary judgment motion because anybody who sells the security without registration is liable under the Securities Act, and nobody will enforce the contract that violates the registration provisions of the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.068" offset="10276205">So I do not think it is from my brother Freeman to say that we are trying to litigate irrelevant questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.529" offset="10314030">Then the argument is made it is a mere stay and I hope I have answered that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.144" offset="12024528">First I think I should make it clear that the reason that the State Courts have not acted in this case and have waited is that every action as I understand has been on a motion for stay by Calvert so that they are in a hurry to get justice, they are not in a hurry to get justice in the State Court to which Judge Will remitted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.979" offset="12119823">Then Mr. Loss says if we get it decided that this is a security, then we have some rights because you cannot sell a security without registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.184" offset="12164649">But that is under the 33 Act where there is no exclusive jurisdiction as there is on 10b-5 where the Congress said suit may be brought in any Court of competent jurisdiction so as far as the 33 Act is concerned on which Mr. Loss is mentioning his reliance, that that is something that Congress said you can go into a State Court and you can bring affirmative actions in the State Court and so that there is no exclusive federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.226" offset="12288887">That leaves them down to 10b-5 and he says I have got a 10b-5 claim which will let me off in the State Court but I would like to go into a Federal Court because I prefer that and he has got a right to do that under the First Amendment but it seems to me to be perfectly clear that that is what federal judges are for to see that rights which are provided by statute are not abused so that the Courts are made mere puppets to carry out the desires of litigants for one forum rather than the other when they are both able to give justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.767" offset="12450951">It seems to me that that is the essential element here as to whether you are going to give trial judges the right, the discretion free of the threat of mandamus when they exercise what the panel itself down below said was a correct decision on discretion that this will result in more efficient justice, more promptly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.604" offset="12642376">That was lost because they waited beyond 30 days.</text>
