            <text syncTime="50.453" offset="281759">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.964" offset="295760">Section 10b and Rule 10b5 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 does not prescribe all fraudulent schemes that have anything to do with securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.995" offset="347901">It only prescribes and renders unlawful, those fraudulent schemes that are “in connection with the purchase or sale of any securities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="79.394" offset="397533">This case presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.803" offset="407147">One, whether a pledge of securities as collateral or commercial loan was a purchase or sale herein within the meaning of the 1934 Act which defines purchase “to include any contract to buy, purchase, or otherwise acquire” to permit a pledgee to bring in action under Section 10b and Rule 10b5.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.892" offset="511532">The second question is whether the “in connection with” requirements of the Act is satisfied when a bank which releases collectible to its debtor upon the repayment of the indebtedness as it was required to do under law and the alleged sale is the pledge of securities to a plaintiff who is totally unknown to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.523" offset="618007">The facts in this case are fairly simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.461" offset="733782">Bankers Trust is a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.284" offset="741096">It received approximately 40,000 shares of equity national stock as collateral for a loan in August of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.627" offset="774428">At that time, the lending officers received an opinion letter of counsel that the stock would be negotiable within six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.900" offset="807551">When a bank receives a pledge of stock, it does not look to the collateral for repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.261" offset="832942">It primarily asks how the indebtedness is going to be repaid and looks at the credit worthiness of the borrower plus other elements relating to repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.874" offset="875470">A banker does not make a loan with the expectation that he is going to be required to foreclose on collateral to collect its indebtedness regardless of whether the collateral has stock, real estate, cattle, or accounts receivable financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.406" offset="941612">A banker does not want to be involved in an expensive foreclosure proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.891" offset="959480">He does not want to have to use lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.784" offset="967107">He merely wants a return of the moneys he loaned.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.742" offset="982885">The bank, in this case, played no role whatsoever in arranging with Mallis and Kupferman , the respondents herein, to borrow money from Franklin National Bank which they then loaned to Arnold and Fowlers and received their pledge back up collateral from Arnold and Fowlers.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.088" offset="2180338">Then, there was an agreement by Mallis and Kupferman to borrow moneys from Franklin and loan the money to Arnold and Fowler.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.442" offset="2225687">Bankers, again, was totally unaware of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.719" offset="2234778">Bankers was not privy to any of these transactions with Mallis and Kupferman.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.639" offset="2250451">On the morning of March 3, Mallis and Kupferman went into the offices of Franklin National Bank in the suburbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.521" offset="2285978">They signed the necessary documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.679" offset="2294650">Then, Mallis was told by Murfet “no need to be present.”</text>
            <text syncTime="558.668" offset="2314608">He expected the transaction to be paid by a sale of 100,000 shares of Merck and Co. stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.253" offset="2340939">The pledged transaction was a usurious contract because Dr. Mallis, at the time he loaned these gentlemen $156,000, was going to make “a profit of of $50,000 within 30 days.”</text>
            <text syncTime="581.283" offset="2405096">Arithmetically computed that comes to 383%.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.165" offset="2428606">This was raised by Mr. Fowler in the State Court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.817" offset="2443235">The critical fact here is that no one alleges that Bankers Trust nor any of its representatives including its attorneys did anything either by action or non-action until the closing on the afternoon of March 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.580" offset="2506242">Bankers did not introduce Kates to Arnold and Fowler.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.476" offset="2517840">Bankers did not even know the existence of Mallis and Kupferman until after the closing and the beginning of these lawsuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.573" offset="2646258">Bankers’ only function at the collateral was to return collateral to its debtor, Kates, upon repayment of the indebtedness as it was required to do under the New York Uniform Commercial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.967" offset="2695787">At the closing, Arnold asked Kates for an affidavit on behalf of the respondents, Mallis and Kupferman.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.332" offset="2725253">On the basis of information furnished by Fowler, he knew that there was a problem between Equity National, Kates, and Arnold.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.985" offset="2755868">Fowler had contacted the President of Equity National and he told Arnold of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.588" offset="2774258">That is in the deposition in the State Court which we just obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.960" offset="2787738">Arnold accepted an affidavit from Kates saying that there were no restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.611" offset="2810412">At that time, Bankers had not knowledge with respect to these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.311" offset="2837161">The stock was redeemed by Mr. Kates and it was returned to the Kates’.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.147" offset="2856492">Indeed, at the closing, a check was offered to Bankers Trust Co. made payable to Bankers Trust Co. and Kates.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.613" offset="2890347">Bankers Trust Co. refused to touch that check because Bankers Trust said “I am not privy to any of these transactions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="711.897" offset="2927545">Eventually, a State Court of action was instituted against Bankers.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.060" offset="2948129">That action was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.011" offset="2959937">The court there said that how could Bankers be liable when they did not know these people and had nothing these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.243" offset="2984910">At the same time that action was dismissed, a suit against Fowler and Arnold who were still part of that action alleging a breach of contract as well as fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.024" offset="3028064">Fowler and Arnold instituted third party actions on the breach of contracts against Bankers.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.909" offset="3067561">Indeed, the deposition of Mallis by Bankers is now scheduled for February 1, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.894" offset="3095565">This is clearly an analogous situation to the Blue Chip case and Bourbon whereby there is a remedy in State Court, the cases are still pending in the State Court, and there is no need for 10b or 10b5 in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.204" offset="3156796">It is our position that a pledge of stock is not a sale within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.457" offset="3181769">The plain language of the Act in Blue Chip Stamps and Hawk Felder, as pointed out by this court there, stated that since we are dealing with a judicially created right the court must construe the statute narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.711" offset="3246761">The statute requires that there would be a purchase or sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.150" offset="3260554">A pledger of stock is not a seller of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.262" offset="3276959">All right, title, and interest remain in the pledger.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.306" offset="3313112">Any increase in value of the stock remains in the pledger.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.487" offset="3325860">He has the right to dispose off the securities when and to whomever he wishes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.648" offset="4254565">As the SEC and Mallis assert, anytime a transaction touches securities the transactions will be subject to the Federal Courts and the scope of 10b and 10b5 will be extended far beyond what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.593" offset="4306288">Congress plainly did not intend to include as part of the securities laws the release of collateral from a pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.203" offset="4340769">Although, as Justice Stevens asked, we do not believe that there was any misrepresentation and there was no purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.097" offset="4372325">Nonetheless, before an action can be instituted the plaintiff must satisfy the statutory requirement in connection between the alleged misrepresentation and the purchase or sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.064" offset="4420182">There must be a nexus or causation between the defendants and the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.659" offset="4438572">In this case, there was no such nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.049" offset="4452156">Bankers did not know of their existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.713" offset="4470755">Bankers accepted the pledge of collateral on August 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.276" offset="4485070">Its customer redeemed the collateral on March 3, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.352" offset="4501370">The contract had been entered into to purchase the collateral on February 26 and everything had been locked in long before there was any participation of Bankers at the closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.699" offset="4554765">There is no possible way of imposing upon Bankers a duty to make any disclosure when it did not even know these people’s existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.267" offset="4608995">Bankers was only a passive participant in a transaction organized by Arnold and Mallis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.846" offset="4631356">The Court of Appeals sought to place a connecting link by finding that Bankers was a seller by the release of the collateral and Mallis and Kupferman purchasers by virtue of the acceptance of the pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.694" offset="4674719">But, this finding skips two intervening transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.975" offset="4691855">Bankers release the collateral to Kates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.084" offset="4708260">Kates had sold the stock to Arnold and Fowler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.138" offset="4720485">Arnold and Fowler may have pledged the stock to Mallis and Kupferman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.176" offset="4732606">There was no real connection in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.972" offset="4743787">A bank’s release of a collateral to its debtor is plainly no representation of the value of the collateral to any third party nor of its bona fides to any unknown third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.661" offset="4794569">As Judge Cardosa stated in Moris and recognized by this court in Blue Chip Stamps and Hawk Felder, to hold Bankers Trust liable in this case would be to extend liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.518" offset="4854023">Congress did not so intend to expand the securities laws.</text>

            <label>Mr. John L. Warden</label>
            <text syncTime="1234.737" offset="5018908">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.233" offset="5048897">The principle proposition that is decisive of this case is the fact that the words “purchase” and “sale” used in the 1934 Act are ordinary words and, under the teachings of this court, must therefore be accorded their commonly accepted meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.244" offset="5140952">Those commonly accepted meanings do not include pledge transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.646" offset="5162477">That is, the pledging of securities or other property or the release of a pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.481" offset="5185883">Purchase and sale involve the transfer of ownership for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.298" offset="5213155">A pledge does not transfer ownership or a general property interest in the pledged property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.859" offset="5247323">I might say, at this point in response to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question earlier about statutory definition that does include pledge that is in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.762" offset="5298941">It's inclusion there, we submit, shows that when Congress wants to impose upon a common word such as purchase or sale, an artificial or special meaning to avoid repetition lengthy number of terms and in order to achieve the purposes of a statute, it knows perfectly well how to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.633" offset="5386503">There is no indication in the legislative history or otherwise that either the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act was intended to regulate credit transactions in the ordinary course of business on a face-to-face basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.359" offset="5457347">As Professor Loss has pointed out in criticizing even the Gil Films decision, under the ’33 Act, federal law was not required to deal with the individual loan transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.381" offset="5505413">What Congress was concerned about was the regulation of primary and secondary public securities markets of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.871" offset="5543447">The statutes as drafted, of course, cover personally negotiated purchases and sales, a point made by the SEC in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.714" offset="5586810">That is quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.614" offset="5590363">The statute as drafted both of them do cover that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.671" offset="5606663">That indicates that Congress did no attempt to draw the line between public trading insecurities and private purchases and sales of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.769" offset="5646996">But, it did deal with purchases and sales, not with regulation of credit transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.674" offset="5682627">The Court of Appeals and the SEC, in its brief, have suggested that the ordinary meaning of purchase and sale should be disregarded because of the statutory definition which says sale includes a contract to sell or otherwise dispose off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.654" offset="5758591">There is nothing in the legislative history that indicates that the addition of the words “or otherwise dispose off” was intended to take away the very core of the meaning of the word “sale.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.677" offset="5818673">In fact, as we pointed out in our brief, a strict definition of the word “sale” as obtained at that time involved the transfer of ownership for a price paid in money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.360" offset="5881367">The words” and otherwise dispose off” extend the definition of the word “sale” to an exchange or barter transaction or, as this case held in SEC against National Securities, a statutory merger where there is, in fact, an exchange of ownership but not for consideration in money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.432" offset="5997664">To attempt to read anything more into those words, without any warrant in the legislative history is to engage in construction by speculation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.180" offset="6076658">Mr. Justice Stewart, I think that it would probably be sufficient if there were a purchase and sale in the ordinary informal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.736" offset="6118872">That is, if I said to someone “I will sell you a part interest in the 100 shares of General Motors that I own” and he said “fine, I will pay $1,000 for that,” and I took it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.177" offset="6164639">I think that would be a purchase or sale within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.926" offset="6183656">I do not think that transfer on the books of the transfer agent or turning the shares and to get 250 share certificates would be required.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.676" offset="6242693">Well, Your honor, I do not think that anything that was done or alleged to have been done by Bankers Trust in this case is in connection with the transaction of which the plaintiffs complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.776" offset="6295042">That transaction, as Mr. Weiner pointed out, was entirely arranged before this closing occurred in the offices of Bankers Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.749" offset="6330882">I might point out that that as one of the aspects of the case it is a very serious concern in the banking community, because it is quite a common thing for banks which, after all, maintain conference rooms for the purposes of closings to afford the use of those rooms to their customers for the conduct of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.823" offset="6419280">If that brings one’s activities into disputes that otherwise do not involve the bank, what you have is an inhibition on a bank’s banking facilities available to people which does not include the public interest in any way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.968" offset="7675770">The appellants, it seems to me, have spent most of their argument time in arguing against the position taken by the SEC in their brief amicus curiae to this court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1983.776" offset="8015049">In Woodward against the Bank of Dallas, which is cited by the briefs by the parties to this court, the District Court in a similar pledge situation held and held twice before the trial that dismissal in a pledge situation of a 10b5 case would be premature because the plaintiff might be able to prove enough facts to spell out the requisite standing to sue as required by Rule 10b5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.126" offset="8144407">Eventually, when the case did reach the Fifth Circuit, I think it was, the court dismissed the complaint but not on the basis that there was not any jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.165" offset="8176590">They expressly found there was jurisdiction where stock had been pledged to a bank, dismissed it on the ground that the bank’s knowledge of what had occurred with respect to a fraud was insufficient to impose liability upon them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2379.166" offset="9596606">There are three reasons why this court should affirm the Second Circuit’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.588" offset="9630252">In the first place, it is not at all clear whatever the plaintiffs may have understood this transaction to have meant to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2399.147" offset="9676541">They understood that they were lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.230" offset="9684900">But, the only document in the record which indicates what their relationship with was with Arnold and Fowler appears at page 49 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.588" offset="9726278">I would call Your Honor’s attention to the language of the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.210" offset="9744773">“Your participation in the purchase,” says Mr. Arnold to Mr. Mallis, “your advance of 156,000 toward the purchase price,” “your participation in the trade,” “your investment,” and finally, “you will be reimbursed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.838" offset="9815303">A loan presupposes that it will be repaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.266" offset="9828991">But, nowhere in that letter does it say by whom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.534" offset="9858040">I do not think that any member of this court would grant summary judgment against Arnold or Fowler on the theory that he received a loan from Mallis or Kates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.693" offset="9898686">It seems to me that if they did not borrow the money that neither Mallis nor Kates was a lender, and I think it is too early to conclude what their position was, certainly it can conclusively assume that they were lenders rather than participants in the trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.941" offset="9971725">Let us assume for a moment that they were lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.489" offset="9985935">If, as this court has said, the starting point for the determination of standing to sue under the Rule 10b5 is the statute and the statute says that a fraud made “in connection with” a sale is the trigger for a 10b5 liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.850" offset="10079349">Of course, there was a sale here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.671" offset="10094605">The reason that the case is perhaps a little confusing is because it is sandwiched in between the release of one pledge and the creation of another pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.010" offset="10135982">But, the pledge to Mallis and Kupferman was simultaneous with the purchase by Arnold and Fowler if, indeed, they were the purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.236" offset="10176838">I draw your attention to the fact that Arnold, when he signed the purchase agreement, signed it as attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.639" offset="10198467">That is in a representative capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.180" offset="10208707">Now, there could have been no sale except for the fact that Mallis and Kupferman came with the money through their representative, of course, to a closing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3921.168" offset="15764639">Your honor, Mr. Pitt referred to the phrase “interest” in definition of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.081" offset="15792224">That is not in the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.983" offset="15799852">That is in the 1933 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.527" offset="15810092">The 1934 Act very clearly speaks about sale or other disposition thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.959" offset="15831721">That is one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.211" offset="15836737">The second point that is important is that there is a substantial difference between buying stock to make a collateralized loan and making a collateralized loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.977" offset="15875816">The lending factor which we sought to stress earlier is based on the general credit of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.180" offset="15904655">They are not looking at the value of collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.100" offset="15916358">The Gil Films case, which is the first time that the SEC really pushed the question as to whether or not a pledge was a sale, was in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.793" offset="15955124">Professor Loss refers to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.113" offset="15968394">In that case, there was a sham transaction and it was not a pure bona fide pledge and they expanded the question therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.175" offset="16008622">Now, one of the factors that is really very, very important here is that a lot has been stated about what is beyond the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.742" offset="16042895">Subsequent, and I would like to clarify some facts which have just come to our attention as a result of the State Court action.</text>
