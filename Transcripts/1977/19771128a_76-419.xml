            <text syncTime="26.513" offset="105953">I represent Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation through the petitioner in Number 76-419 and my argument will be confined to that case and the issues which are raised therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.161" offset="160601">This matter comes before this court on a Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals at the District of Columbia Circuit, that for it, two actions of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.684" offset="222668">First the action of that commission in granting and operating license to the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, a Nuclear Electric Generating Station located in Vernon, Vermont and owned by my client Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation, the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.764" offset="294975">In addition, it has before it the promulgation by that agency of a regulation which for the first time permitted in individual reactor licensing cases limited consideration of the environmental affects of the separately licensed and located facilities where the various matters such as reactor field manufacturing and reprocessing and waste disposal activities take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.506" offset="429976">These activities are sometimes referred to and I referred to them as the fuel cycle activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.390" offset="457456">By its judgments the United State Court of Appeals struck down the agency's regulation on the ground that insufficient procedures had been utilized in its promulgation.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.538" offset="510119">The court also remanded the agency decision authorizing the assurance of an operating license to Vermont Yankee on the grounds that issuance of any such license had to be preceded by what the court called a thorough ‘ventilation' of the environmental effects of the fuel cycle activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.271" offset="604996">Now though procedurally complex and as laid out in detail in our brief at pages 11 through 25, this case I respectfully submit is substantively quite simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.264" offset="657032">Now before you proceed Mr. Dignan, may I ask you a question, the respondents say in their supplemental statement of facts that your client Vermont Yankee has now been granted an operating license, and at the time to seek review of that license has expired without petition for review being filed, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="197.262" offset="789002">I do not believe this case is moot which is being suggested by this late filed brief because when Vermont Yankee went into the Court of Appeals, Vermont Yankee had a full term 40-year license.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Dignan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="230.139" offset="920555">The question then will be, whether or not there is a new rule in place as to whether Vermont Yankee's license would continue, or whether the commission takes some other action.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.769" offset="962978">But it is our position that Vermont Yankee had a good 40 year license at the start and that this court should enforce that initial decision of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.472" offset="1001848">That Vermont Yankee should not have to litigate further for its full-term license.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.339" offset="1029329">Now as I indicated I believe this case is quite simple substantively.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.048" offset="1052108">To begin with, the Court of Appeals struck down an agency regulation on the basis that the National Environmental Policy Act is to be construed as in effect amending the Administrative Procedure Act to require all agencies to provide more than the noticed increment proceeding called 4 and 5 U.S. Code section 553, in any rule making proceedings which affect the environmental responsibilities of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.820" offset="1175197">Second, the Court of Appeals remanded the petitioner's license as the result of a holding that the National Environmental Policy Act should be read as amending the Atomic Energy Act in substance by saying that the technical and economic resolution of the so-called high level nuclear waste question should be undertaken and indeed essentially resolved as to methodology prior to the issuance of any more reactor licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.431" offset="1297659">Now third, the Court of Appeals accomplished all of this through the device of utilizing extra record evidence which was never presented to the agency in either the Vermont Yankee case or the rulemaking proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.195" offset="1348754">Indeed, it consisted of articles that were written after the rule was promulgated and in one case after the case was argued to the Court of Appeals which were utilized to setup a supposed conflict with theretofore uncontested expert testimony of an agency staff member.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.511" offset="1425972">And having done that, the Court of Appeals then held that the rule was not well supported as a result of procedural misfeasance.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.479" offset="1473829">Now we believe the decision to be an error for a number of reasons as set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.559" offset="1498175">In the first place, I respectfully suggest that this decision is flatly contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act and the National Environmental Policy Act as interpreted by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.834" offset="1543314">In its decision the Court of Appeals admits that the requirements of Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act were exceeded in this case and indeed, they of course were.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.191" offset="1604754">There was an opportunity for comment; there was an oral hearing, an opportunity for comments on the comments and an opportunity after that for comments on the comments on the comments.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="413.358" offset="1653342">By exceeded you mean there was more than adequate complaince.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.476" offset="1665881">That is our view Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="418.202" stopTime="421.613">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="418.202" offset="1672777">And that you say was the Court of Appeals' view?</text>

          <turn speaker="thomas_g_dignan" startTime="421.613" stopTime="647.635">
            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Dignan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="421.613" offset="1686361">Well, the Court of Appeals said that we exceeded the requirements of Section 553, but that that was not enough to comply with the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.354" offset="1717394">And it is our belief that the prior decisions of this court have indicated that Section 553 means precisely what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.123" offset="1748428">Also this court has indicated that the National Environmental Policy Act cannot be read as amending other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.341" offset="1777267">And therefore to the extent that the court below was saying that the National Environmental Policy Act works sub silentio and amendment of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.550" offset="1818122">I believe the decisions of this court in the scrap cases preclude such a holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.388" offset="1845499">We also submit that this decision transgresses the rulings of this court in the recent (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.614" offset="1878413">The (Inaudible) decisions stands for the proposition that feasibility and practicality have to govern in some respect the working of the National Environmental Policy Act and the scope of an agency's responsibility there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.193" offset="1940689">As it's clear from this record, two boards of this agency, both of which had majority, two members who were technically trained people found that it was essentially a practical impossibility to consider in detail in an individual reactor licensing proceeding, the activities that would take place at a fuel cycle proceeding yet to be applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.329" offset="2041313">In addition these two boards ruled as a matter of law that the proposal before them as that term is used in NEPA was the licensing of Vermont Yankee not the licensing of these other facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.525" offset="2094080">Therefore these boards ruled, we need not get into this at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.781" offset="2111112">I respectfully suggest those rulings though much earlier then are entirely consistent with this court's rulings in the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.610" offset="2154371">We also maintain that this decision basically contravenes a long history which shows an intent in Congress that the solving of the so-called high level waste problem is not a matter that must precede the issuance of reactor licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.128" offset="2232424">This is laid out in our brief in some detail but it is clear that what this court wanted was the waste problem to be solved and I would note that at page 78 at of Appendix judge Tam says it flatly, he says I agree with the majority that NEPA requires the commission fully to assure itself that safe and adequate storage methods are technologically and economically feasible, and I suggest to this court that the history in Congress is that Congress has been aware since 1954 that the final selection and the final decisions on this matter have not been made and Congress has made no move to stop the licensing of reactors.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.526" offset="2414028">Now essentially, what is argued in response to these various arguments, in response to Mr., Justice Stewart earlier, I addressed this question of whether the case has become moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.334" offset="2465332">A second argument that is made to this court is this is just a record case, that the court below just found a record inadequate and it's really not worthy of this court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.005" offset="2503993">I can only quote what the court itself said the issue before it said “thus we are called upon to decide whether the procedures provided by the agency were sufficient to ventilate the issues” that is what they thought they were deciding in the rule making case and I submit that that is what they did decide and decided it erroneously.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="647.635" offset="2590511">You would concede, would you not Mr. Dignan that there's some ambiguity in the opinion of the Court of Appeals particularly when viewed in the light of the concurring.</text>

            <text syncTime="657.437" offset="2629695">I would be less than candid with this court if I did not admit that this opinion admits of different readings by different people.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.038" offset="2660101">On the other hand I would remind this court that to let this decision stand I respectfully suggest means chaos in the administrative process of the United States this time, not only in this agency but in other agencies because no agency can now be sure precisely what it must go through in order to promulgate a valid rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.114" offset="4276454">At the time that Vermont Yankee's operating license was issued, the commission took the position that it would give no consideration to questions of reprocessing and waste management and disposal during the licensing proceedings, although shortly thereafter, it adopted the 1974 Fuel Cycle Rule in which in recognition of the fact, that waste problems are irretrievably set in motion by the granting of the license to a plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.135" offset="4416470">It decided that it should factor in to the extent it's possible to do so, some environmental values reflected in the management and disposal of waste and in reprocessing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.275" offset="5269002">The 1974 rule has been replaced by the interim rule to which we refer on pages 30 and 31 of our brief and the commission has now undertaken to replace the interim rule with a permanent rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.261" offset="5337025">Moreover, the interim rule has been applied to the Vermont Yankee case in decision of July 18, 1977 by the Commission's Appeal Board that is reprinted as a supplement to a supplemental brief just submitted by respondent in the case and in that decision the Appeal Board determined that the values in the revised table to be used in the interim rule when applied to the Vermont Yankee application do not tip of the balance of costs and benefits previously determined in the environmental survey done there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.128" offset="6596441">Well, 77, I am told, it's relatively recent and it's to be in effect for 18 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.541" offset="6626116">Now, what the commission is concerned about however is the procedural holding of the Court of Appeals because in adopting the interim rule, it followed the statutorily prescribed procedures of Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.711" offset="6706782">If rather than afford additional procedures which the Court of Appeals held in hindsight had been required in the other rulemaking proceeding, although the Court of Appeals never spelled out what those procedures should be and with respect to the new rule to be adopted, the commission is not proposing to engage in an adjudicatory type of rulemaking with rights of discovery and cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.752" offset="6838962">It has invited the participants to suggest questions and follow-up questions for the board to ask witnesses at the hearing to be held in connection with the new rule, but there are practical reasons why the commission chooses not to proceed in an adjudicatory manner as no statute requires it to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.643" offset="6946482">With respect to the 1974 rule, there were some 40 individuals in organizations who participated and the Commission anticipates that at least as large a number will be concerned with the hearings with respect to the new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.197" offset="7016699">It has already received comments and proposed questions across and follow-up questions which are quite voluminous, and there are practical limits to the use of an adjudicatory process in a rulemaking proceeding of this kind if the distinction between rulemaking and adjudication is to perform the function that was conceived for it under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.184" offset="7160686">For that reason, the commission is concerned with the holding of the Court of Appeals here and what it portends for the Commission's ability to proceed through rulemaking with what the commission considers to be more appropriate responses to these problems in the licensing of plants and it believes that the procedural holding of the Court of Appeals based as far as we're able to tell, purely on the Court of Appeal's dissatisfaction with the results that were reached in the 1974 rule, rather than with any infirmity that it could point to in the proceedings adopted from the perspective of the time when the Commission adopted them should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.269" offset="7397042">Indeed, there was no showing to the Commission at any particularized need for discovery or cross-examination with respect to any of the issues with which the Court of Appeals later decided the record was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.414" offset="7465587">Now I should say that that the interim rule has not yet been applied to the Midland Power of facility involved in the companion case, the Consumer's Power case, but its application is pertinent to a proceeding that is presently pending before the appeal board and it's anticipated that the interim rule will be applied in that proceeding in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.739" offset="7590870">In that case, the Court of Appeals found two additional shortcomings in the commission's proceedings which we have dealt with in our brief and which Mr. Horsky will deal with in his argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.480" offset="7717825">I represent the petitioner in Number 528 Consumers Power Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.662" offset="7738619">This is a challenge to a construction license rather than an operating license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.928" offset="7763696">In the Court of Appeals opinion in this case they incorporated by reference, their decision in the Vermont Yankee case, and for that reason I joined in what has been said by Mr. Dignan and Mr. Wallace in urging a reversal of that decision, but on that issue I would prefer to rest what has been said and go on to the other two issues which were involved in the Midland case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.931" offset="7875709">Those two issues involved two separate grounds which have nothing to do with the fuel cycle issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.916" offset="7907579">The first is whether the commission, whether the licensing board in granting the construction license, adequately dealt with what I might shorter-hand call conservation of energy alternatives to the grant of the construction license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.719" offset="7982811">The other is whether the report of the advisory committee on nuclear safeguards which is one of the statutory requirements, where the hearing and grant of a license was adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.947" offset="8043729">Let me take them up in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.792" offset="8055118">First, with respect to the so-called energy conservation issue, it's a (Inaudible) issue, did the licensing board properly consider the alternative to the plan of energy conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.392" offset="8117499">We submit that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.900" offset="8131500">The procedures started with an environmental impact statement which covered all of the various categories, all of the various considerations and attached to it for circulation and ultimate hearing, where some 119 energy or environmental considerations propounded by an intervener which called Saginaw, that draft environmental impact statement report was then the subject of hearings, adjudicatory hearings, cross-examination, preceded by discovery and all the rest, where it lasted for 14 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.643" offset="8298475">It's perhaps worth noting that the Saginaw intervener who propounded the considerations failed to participate in those hearings, but those hearings developed in detail, the need for the project, a conclusion which was supported by the Michigan Public Service Commission, the Federal Power Commission and Environmental Protection Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.802" offset="8383112">The controversy relates to some 17 of these 119 environmental contentions propounded by Saginaw, which are said to be all over, the words are not used, energy conservation contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.689" offset="8446746">Some of them were dealt with by the licensing board specifically, for example, it considered and found that there was no basis for holding that the consumers power had artificially enhanced the requirements for electricity and therefore distorted its demand figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.383" offset="8517486">The Licensing Board did decline however to consider a number of Saginaw somewhat rhetorical contentions in dealing with general, whether or not it would be proper to set limits on the uses of electricity whereas the licensing board put it whether we should consider whether the present customer uses of electricity in our society are proper or improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.662" offset="8646635">The Appeal Board affirmed that decision but that wasn't the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.517" offset="8670041">While the petition for review was pending in the court below, the interveners asked that the hearing before the licensing board be reopened on the ground that the commission in the meantime in a decision called an Niagara Power decision had said things which were inconsistent with the decision of the licensing board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.651" offset="8750602">That motion to reopen the hearings was passed upon, ruled upon by the Commission itself in a long careful opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.736" offset="8786860">In that opinion, it reviewed each of these 17 contentions, and set forth in careful, study words why believe the Licensing Board was correct in not having to consider the contentions which were urged with respect to energy conservation which the licensing board did not consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="2269.819" offset="9079223">All I can say is that since that time, there have been no substantial changes in the Dow consumer relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.054" offset="9104196">The Court of Appeals in its decision said, you might relook at those questions, but as we point out in our reply brief, the situation with respect to Dow is essentially the same as it has been since the time, the commission itself re-examined the issue and decided that there was no basis for a modification of its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.474" offset="9185802">I think that Dow question can be put to one side Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.168" offset="9204611">What is clear in this record, it seems to me is that there is a need -- a clearly demonstrated need for the power, that this plant is to generate and it also seems to me that the Commission was quite correct in saying the Licensing Board did not need to consider the kind of contentions for example, and I quote the possibility of changing the present social stimuli to society which could result in a decreased demand for electricity or another one, that Dow Chemical should be denied electricity in order that it would be encouraged to develop power sources and I quote again, from other sources not on demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.420" offset="9369600">I think the board was correct in saying that if those kinds of contentions did not require the licensing board to go into them in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.824" offset="9415262">That's not to say that the board didn't have a responsibility for determining that there was a need for the power to be generated, of course it did, and it went into that in great detail examining the demand statistics which were presented in very detail to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.707" offset="9482762">What it is to say is that under NEPA, commission it seems to me was entirely warranted in saying that the interveners who were challenging the demand and suggesting an alternative to the plant had the responsibility for developing something more specific than what the kinds of things I've just suggested, with reasonably specific conservation measures which as the commission put it, would require reasonable minds to inquire further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.893" offset="9603553">That's the character -- that's the threshold test which the Court of Appeals found so arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.133" offset="9632496">It seems to me, it's anything but that and let me mention again what Mr. Wallace adverted to briefly in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.155" offset="9664575">This decision was made in 1972, this decision to grant the construction license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.297" offset="9693100">At that time, both NEPA and indeed the nation's concern for proper conservation of energy were certainly in a developing state, in a different state than they are today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.754" offset="9742942">The guidelines set out by the Council on environmental quality for the first time in 1973, a year after the decision, suggested that the environmental impact statement should address energy conservation alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.585" offset="9810338">The Federal Power Commission in 1973, for the first time suggested that in consideration of a license for a hydroelectric plant, the alternatives of conservation ought to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.447" offset="9861747">I think under the circumstances in this case and given the time at which the decision was rendered, the Licensing Board acted properly with respect to these energy conservation measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.255" offset="9912947">The other issue is -- as I say in the brief almost a contrived one, but it was the basis of a further order by the court below that we go back to the licensing board again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.440" offset="9965714">This is the alleged inadequacy of the report of the advisory committee on reactor safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.894" offset="9995494">That committee is a 15 member part-time group of distinguished scientists who are charged by the statute to advise the commission to examine and to advise the commission on the preliminary safety analysis report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.911" offset="10075638">The advisory committee did in fact do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.551" offset="10090162">It filed a letter with the commission, pointing out certain problems which they thought the staff should address and then it said, other problems involving light water nuclear reactors are set forth which we think the staff should address are set forth in our early reports on light water nuclear reactors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.483" offset="10173858">The Court of Appeals said that cross reference requires that this case be remanded because the Licensing Board should have sent it back and asked the Advisory Committee to specify the other factors which the Advisory Committee said the staff should consider, and do it in a language intelligible to a layman whatever that means in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.173" offset="10288692">These other reports of the advisory committee were of course known to the commission and to the staff and incidentally, if there is any question about whether the staff was confused, the reply brief filed by government, I think clears up the contention that the staff was confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.312" offset="10361208">The other reports were filed in the public document room of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.674" offset="10378658">Anyone who wanted to go look for them, could have gone to look for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.656" offset="10394540">It seems to me that to say that that kind of a mistake, if it was a mistake and it doesn't seem to be to be one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.347" offset="10433306">It was a customary form of the letter of the advisory committee, doesn't warrant sending this case back to square one which is where we will be before the licensing board, if this decision stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.486" offset="10485864">That we think is just judicial interference from rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.725" offset="10502896">We have set out, I think it is relevant in our brief at some length the procedures which precede the issuance of a construction license for a nuclear plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.165" offset="10552633">The application by the applicant is an enormous document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.559" offset="10574158">It's reviewed and reviewed and reviewed by the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.023" offset="10588056">That's the first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.764" offset="10595056">The safety aspects are considered by the advisory committee, and there's a full adjudicatory type theory on the safety and all other aspects of the plant, preceded as it was in this case by elaborate discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.943" offset="10655765">On the basis of that record the licensing board makes its findings and it spells them out in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.172" offset="10684604">That record is also the subject of what amounts to a de novo review to an appeal board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2718.635" offset="10874462">It realized that it presented hazards as well as benefits, but it went ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.289" offset="10905078">The commission has been equally responsive to hazards and I think what's developed from the statutory requirements and from the commission's regulations is probably the most elaborate, the most detailed, the most comprehensive administrative machinery that was ever devised to determine whether or not government approval or disapproval should come from an application of a private project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.895" offset="11011553">What the court below has done in these two cases is to interject itself into that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.188" offset="11036735">It sets this proceeding back nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.354" offset="11053349">This application was filed in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.708" offset="11066828">The license was granted in 1972, under the decision of the Court of Appeals, we go back to Licensing Board for further hearings and we'll be through the appellate process the Appeal Board all the rest have been up to the Court of Appeals again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.281" offset="11133074">We had a valid construction license until the Court of Appeals acted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.398" offset="11241535">I would like to address the issues in the Vermont Yankee case and Mr. Cherry will follow me and address the issues in the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.838" offset="11279256">I think the respondents in this case would like to make two points clear at the outset that do not seem to have been a court had much importance on the presentation you have heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.061" offset="11328157">The first is that this case arises or these two cases arise under the National Environmental Policy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.455" offset="11361802">The National Environmental Policy Act as this court has said has two purposes; one is that to require disclosure by government agencies who are considering going forward with the project to other decision-makers and to the public in general with the theory being that disclosure will tend to produce better decisions, less environmentally damaging decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.297" offset="11477159">The other is that by requiring the presentation of an environmental impact statement, NEPA is designed to encourage agencies to exercise foresight to foresee the long-range consequences of the things they undertake for short range benefits and we think the issues that were involved in Vermont Yankee case are classic instances of how important that requirement is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.392" offset="11873489">Yes and second that had this case come before them in 1971, they would have come to the same conclusion because essentially, the fact the plant was built and operating, essentially because of the cost involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2995.260" offset="11981009">What they're saying in this decision is when we consider waste issues as we see them then we still conclude that the plant should be licensed and I think that we can also anticipate for certain that when a final rule is promulgated the same decision will be applied given the reasoning in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.705" offset="12070766">So we think that as to Vermont Yankee, the issue of what to Vermont Yankee can operate with this license is really a settled issue and that is the issue on which the court granted cert and there was as you recall.</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.975" offset="12319869">The issue that we are concerned about is the way the commission is dealt with the nuclear waste problem, its refusal to make available to the public, information about the situation and that issue now has moved into the arena of the S3 table and --</text>

            <text syncTime="4634.807" offset="18539207">I think a point to be taken is that whatever the Court does with respect to the fuel cycle case, it really has no impact upon the Aeschliman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.674" offset="18578599">While the fuel cycle issue was one of the four issues remanded by the Court of Appeals, the ACRS issue, the Energy Conservation and the Dow Cost-Benefit Analysis, the fuel cycle issue was given a sentence in the Court of Appeals' opinion below by sucking in by reference to fuel cycle and while we believe that the fuel cycle has some importance to the overall administration and regulation of the nuclear energy, it has no impact upon the case that was consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.952" offset="18699807">Indeed there is some question in our minds given the fact the government opposed the Writ of Certiorari even if the Court took the cert cases and still treats in its briefs the issue secondary, whether this Court not having advised about what is before the Court, whether those issues are even before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.807" offset="18771174">It is our position that the Court ought to take a long hard look before it gets involved in a record kind of case like the Aeschliman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.842" offset="18811298">But in connection with a couple of points made by Consumer Powers Council, I think it is important to bear up; first of all it is not true that the Dow issue is essentially quiescent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.433" offset="18865633">Once again we have a moving target with respect to these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.168" offset="18880575">We have gone through a year of remanded hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.367" offset="18893427">There are new facts before the Commission now and assuming hypothetically that this Court does choose to reverse the Court of Appeals on Aeschliman, those facts are still before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.896" offset="18939507">The Commission under 10 CFR 50.100, its general superintendent power, cannot ignore facts and is proceeding forward with that case and so once again there is a fresh record that may wind its way through the appeal process in the Court of Appeals, because we are now dealing with those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.608" offset="19010351">But in connection with the Dow issue specifically there was a decision by the Licensing Board on remand just September of this year where Licensing Board of the Commission said “while Dow need steam Dow does not necessarily need it for Midland and whether Dow will ever buy steam from that plant is on this record speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.532" offset="19090077">Whether the circumstances will change by the time the remanding hearing is concluded is impossible to know,” and it goes on and suggested if Dow fails to buy steam, the circumstances will be one of a plant at a site for which only very limited alternatives were explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.785" offset="19147128">What has occurred in the process is that consumers ran out of money in the 74/75 period, the amount of funds they have spent now is barely I think 20/22% of the total amount and the remanded hearing is which this Court would interrupt by reversal of the Court of Appeals are all but over.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.238" offset="19220898">I would contemplate those remanded hearing might not last more than six months from when they begin and they are scheduled to begin as soon as the appeal board rules on the interim relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="4860.338" offset="19441267">In connection with the argument made about our neither raising energy conservation issues where the ACRS being unimportant, I think it also important to understand that the position of the government and of the utility in this case has constantly been changing, for example on energy conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.361" offset="19521411">In 1972 the licensing board said that the contentions we wanted to raise will be on their province.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.749" offset="19546906">That ruling came that's why we didn't participate in the hearing because we were told we couldn't deal with those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.624" offset="19574491">In 1973 the Appeal Board said that our contentions are well beyond the pail of NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.405" offset="19597584">Now as of 1972, President Nixon already submitted to Congress a comprehensive energy policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.250" offset="19620989">Chairman Dob or Commissioner Dob of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in specific answers to the joint committee had dealt with the question of energy conservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4917.972" offset="19671876">So the suggestion that the Commission was not aware of energy conservation as an alternative is really legal top security and it's barring of the issues below is no more than trickery because the Commission was aware that the regulatory staff moved very quickly below in the record before it sit out and consumers obliviously made the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.372" offset="19757453">In 1974 it was the first time that the Commission below decided to change what their position was and why they barred energy conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.910" offset="19791621">They abandoned the beyond the pale NEPA argument because it was unsupportable and I think the government's brief admits that and says for the first time that we didn't raise our contention specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.897" offset="19835507">Now stopping right there, you have an agency which says that your contentions weren't specific, that I didn't understand what energy conservation was, that it was beyond the pail of NEPA, that it was involving concept.</text>

            <text syncTime="5297.806" offset="21191158">And what is important in terms of the agreement proceeding is for these alternatives to be explored.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.461" offset="21221773">Now in the brief of Consumer's Power before the Court there is a suggestion made which I am sure is not pressed very strongly but I would like to make a point about it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.522" offset="21277989">The argument starts out that we spent $325 million on a plant with obviously the tag end line that this involves substantial amount of money and the Court ought to be aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.569" offset="21334204">We would like to deal with that issue kind of expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.878" offset="21343504">First of all, there is a lot in the record as to whether this money is recoverable, whether those were honest amounts, but let's just – and I might also point of the amount of the plant originally conceived that around 500 million is up to almost 2 billion dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.034" offset="21400033">So, the amounts while perhaps large are not in terms of the total amount of the plant, but the point I would like to suggest in terms of the Commission's foreclosure argument is really the same kind of argument being implicitly made by the suggestion that lot of money was spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.161" offset="21464607">The idea that any amount of money can substantially provide a legal basis for a bankrupt decision is certainly impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.801" offset="21507135">And when we finally reach the Supreme Court or if those issues are not properly before this Court, the Court of Appeals, we did everything we could to get before that court and if we are told that that point in time some three or four years later that the issues were important, they should have been ventilated and yet then we are told that the amount of money having been spent is important, regulation then amounts to having someone purchase a legal opinion from a reputable lawyer, saying that he has in good faith relied upon this and then proceed to implement the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.774" offset="21659063">And that's what really this case is all about because if this case is reversed in terms of the Aeschliman issues, talk about judicial intervention running riot we are going to have no federal agency who will be able to regulate, because APA's regulations, the FTC's regulations, the ICC's regulations, every administrative agency which has to rely on importance of finality will surely be turned around.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.113" offset="21780376">We submit that the issues of energy conservation are not only important to the country today, but they were important in 1970 and there is no basis for the suggestion that the Supreme Court can reply upon a record this case that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not become aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.910" offset="21875566">Thank you very much.</text>
