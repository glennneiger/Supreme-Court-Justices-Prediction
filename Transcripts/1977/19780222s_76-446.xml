            <text syncTime="9.510" offset="118017">This case involves a suit by an inmate of a state prison against various prison officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.210" offset="156783">It was brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and the complaint alleged various violations of the plaintiff's constitutional rights, among which as a claim that the prison officials negligently interfered with his mailing privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.582" offset="242256">The District Court, the Federal District Court in California dismissed this particular claim on summary judgment, holding that the prison officials were immune from liability for damages under the applicable decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.669" offset="310592">The Court of Appeals reversed, indicating that summary judgment on immunity ground was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.450" offset="345701">We granted certiorari and we reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.549" offset="366076">In our judgment in the circumstances of this case, the District Court was correct in holding that the officials were immune as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.320" offset="405260">The opinion we have filed, attempts to state the reasons for this result, but not well enough to convince everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.355" offset="441309">The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stevens have each filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
