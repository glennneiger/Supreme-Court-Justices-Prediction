            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79978">I have the judgment to announce in two cases 76-6997, Lockett against Ohio and 76-6513 Bell against Ohio, each of these involving the death penalty statutes of the state of Ohio and for reasons stated in an opinion for the justices supported by others who joined the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.177" offset="220621">The Supreme Court of Ohio is affirmed as to the judgment of conviction in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.074" offset="264194">But reversed in each case to the extent that those judgments sustained the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.304" offset="293137">The cases are each remanded to that Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.237" offset="332843">Justices White, Marshall, Blackmun and Rehnquist each filed separate opinions concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.466" offset="365758">Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in either the consideration or the decision of the case.</text>
