            <text syncTime="43.738" offset="254896">Mr. Margolin, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Phillip M. Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="46.883" offset="267435">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.875" offset="279451">Ensio Lakeside, the petitioner in this case was charged with a felony crime of escape of the second degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.409" offset="313515">Because he was indigent, an attorney was appointed to assist him in the preparation of his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.126" offset="336398">At trial, he raised a defense of lack of criminal responsibility and put on witnesses, including an attorney and a psychiatrist to support his position and explain his position to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.204" offset="388747">Now, as part of his trial strategy, it was decided between the petitioner and his counsel that Mr. Lakeside would not take the stand and that no comment on this fact will be made by Mr. Lakeside’s counsel during the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.483" offset="461890">Just before instructing the jury, the trial judge told Mr. Lakeside’s counsel that he was going to read the following instruction and the instruction reads, “under the laws of this state, a defendant has the option to take the witness stand to testify in his or her own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.240" offset="540884">If a defendant chooses not to testify, such a circumstance gives rise to no inference or presumption against the defendant and this must not be considered by you in determining the question of guilt or innocence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="128.892" offset="595533">Mr. Lakeside’s attorney objected to the giving of this instruction on the grounds that giving the instruction would highlight the fact that Mr. Lakeside had not taken the stand and call the jury’s attention to this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.245" offset="652898">The Court told counsel that he felt that it was best to give this instruction so as to protect the defendant’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.168" offset="684558">Now, the instruction was given to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.333" offset="701276">On appeal, we have two questions that we are presenting for the Court’s consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.423" offset="725622">First we think that the judge’s action violated the Fifth Amendment to the constitution, United States Constitution that Fifth Amendment gives a defendant in a criminal case, the right to decide not to testify and this Court has held in Griffin v. California that if the defendant decides to exercise his right, the prosecutor and the judge should not make a comment on it to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.248" offset="852891">Now, it is our position that even though the judge was acting with the best of motives and even though the instruction was worded so as to be helpful to the defendant, nonetheless in this set of circumstances by reading that instruction the judge did more harm than good and in affect commented on the exercise of the constitutional right by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.931" offset="959680">Additionally, we contend that the trial judge violated the Sixth Amendment to the United States constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.149" offset="996564">Mr. Lakeside had a lawyer appointed to help him out and to figure out what his trial strategy should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.855" offset="1027389">There was a decision made and the decision was that they were not going to comment on the fact that he was not going to take the stand and we feel that when the trial judge took it upon himself to interfere with this strategy that he was interfering with the assistance that Mr. Lakeside had been given by his --</text>

            <label>Mr. Phillip M. Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="405.496" offset="1701871">Our position is that the assistance that the attorney gave here was to advise the client on the exercise of another constitutional right, a constitutional right not to take the stand and that the trial attorney and the petitioner’s position in this should be honored by the Court unless there is some legal basis for the Court’s intervention and the reason I cited the Geders case and the Brooks case was because in those cases, the Court said in Brooks that ordinarily the judge does have a right to figure out what the order of proof will be and in Geders ordinarily a trial judge can decide when witnesses should be sequestered, but then the Court went ahead and said that if there is a conflict between these ordinary powers of the Court and the Sixth Amendment, that the Sixth Amendment should prevail and that the trial judge should not interfere with this assistance that the defendant is getting from his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.780" offset="1967066">Here, I think it is really a serious situation because the defense counsel advised Mr. Lakeside on the exercise of the Fifth Amendment right not to take the stand and from a practical viewpoint that is about the most important decision that a defendant in a criminal case can make.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.584" offset="2046269">The defendant who does not take the stand, it causes a lot of problems as far as his defense goes and he makes that decision and then a trial strategy is devised so as to soften that blow with the jury, I think it is wrong for a trial judge to come in at the end of the trial and interfere with the assistance in the trial strategy that has been plotted out.</text>

No, I do not dare give that,” the Supreme Court does not like that sort of thing and then he is convicted and goes on appeal saying he had asked for the Court to instruct the jury on a constitutional right and what about that?</text>

            <text syncTime="560.926" offset="2323585">Our position is with regard to the Fifth Amendment and this has been that, okay, there is further authority as to whether what the judge did here violates the Fifth Amendment and I think that the problem that courts that have ruled against our position have is it they cannot understand how instruction that supposedly worded to help a defendant, can ever hurt him.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.760" offset="2410938">I think the most important thing I can put across to this Court is that every criminal case has a different set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.530" offset="2442076">You do not have the same situation in each case and sometimes that instruction is very helpful, but sometimes it can hurt your client.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.656" offset="2474573">I would like to give you two quick examples just to show you the realities of courtroom situation and how this identically worded instruction can be good in some cases and bad in some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.729" offset="2522847">Let us take a situation where its helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.992" offset="2531938">You have a murder case and the defendant as made the statement that he was never at the scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.774" offset="2555030">Then the police find a fingerprint at the scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.578" offset="2570285">As soon as the jury hears that they are going to be waiting to hear that defendant come up on the stand and tell them how the fingerprint got there and if your defendant cannot take the stand, you are going to want to have that instruction given in the hopes that the jury will follow it and not hold that against him that he did not get up on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.490" offset="2653877">Also I can give you a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.892" offset="2663490">You have a burglary --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="647.020" stopTime="651.041">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="647.020" offset="2667983">I am not sure all defense lawyers would agree with you on that proposition?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="phillip_m_margolin" startTime="651.041" stopTime="866.545">
            <label>Mr. Phillip M. Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="651.041" offset="2684075">Well, I am just saying that one point I think should make here also is that because every case has a different set of facts, I think that this Court should have faith in the attorney who lives with the case, who is prepared it for months and who conducts a voir dire and gets a chance to size up the jurors who are going to be sitting on the individual case and let him make the type of decision as to whether or not that in this particular case the instruction should be given or should not be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.606" offset="2806328">I think the trial attorney has advantages over a trial judge who just gets the case on the day of trial and I note sometimes if you leave with a case for several months you get insights into it that a person who just comes on it for one or two days he never does.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.747" offset="2862961">So I think its really important here to put faith in the trial attorney and let him make that decision and not give the Court the unfetted right, especially when we are dealing with the advice on something as important as the exercise the Fifth Amendment privilege, not to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.044" offset="2932133">Getting back to the second example, that I want to give the Court, if you have a burglary, a woman wakes up in the middle of the night and sees a man in her apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.245" offset="2964943">She subsequently identifies him in a line up and your client is arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.299" offset="2985110">He comes to you and he tells you he is completely innocent, but he has got a very bad criminal record, may be involving burglaries or sex crimes, something that would upset the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.003" offset="3019905">Additionally, you think he will make a very bad appearance on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.738" offset="3038922">When you get to trial, you put on witnesses that demolish the eyewitness to show that she could not possibly have seen what she said she saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.469" offset="3069851">She had been using narcotics that evening and was out of her mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.358" offset="3085316">Additionally, you put on 25 alibi witnesses who say that the defendant was with them the whole time that this burglary occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.264" offset="3116976">In a situation like that, the jury probably is not even going to expect to hear from the defendant because his witnesses have given the jury all the information that they would need to arrive at a verdict in his favor and I think petitioner’s case fits into that second category.</text>

            <text syncTime="781.099" offset="3204329">He had put on witnesses who explained his position to the jury and probably had the judge not read the instruction, the jurors would not have been thinking too much about the fact that he did not take the stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.631" offset="3294504">The only other thing I did want to go into is an argument that respondent raised in his brief and one of the arguments that was made in the brief is that you cannot have error in a situation like this because jurors will follow the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.882" offset="3363467">So even if the judge should not have given that instruction, once the jurors heard the instruction, then they would follow it and there would not be any prejudice to the defendant’s position and I do not think that that is an appropriate argument for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.920" offset="3427624">The reason I say that is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.722" offset="3434834">First of all there is debate for years whether or not jurors do follow instruction or do not, but if the trial judge had honored the request that was made by the defense counsel and had not given the instruction then you would have eliminated the possibility that the instruction would cause any harm and you would eliminate any possibility of guesswork or any need to make guesses as to what jurors do or do not do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.061" offset="5472176">I might begin by saying that the defendant Lakeside does have quite a background of an unhappy family history.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.492" offset="8585867">First of all I think that this Court can confine itself to the very narrow issue of whether in this particular case if there is a -- if you have a petitioner or defendant who gets advice concerning the exercise of the Fifth Amendment right whether in this type of situation a judge can give instructions over objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.250" offset="8708956">I do not think you have to go ahead and ask yourselves how this would affect other situations where the righteous thing exercised is not a constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.736" offset="8754827">I think the Court could confine itself to that very narrow issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.832" offset="8767262">Secondly, I do not think the reason why a defendant in a particular case does not take the stand or whether the trial strategy is correct or incorrect is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.326" offset="8813237">I think the interesting question is raised here as how far is a judge permitted to go in deciding how a defense will be run.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.985" offset="9143843">What if a defendant’s lawyer affirmatively requested the trial judge not to charge, not to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence and the duty of the prosecution to prove guilty on a reasonable doubt and you have already said that please do not instruct the jury on that subject and the judge said, “Okay you are the lawyer, you are the boss.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2426.708" offset="9786769">But again I do not think that, that type of situation should effect the court’s decision here because here it is a defendant who is getting advice from an attorney who has supposedly have some training and some experience in these matters and it is being made through discussion and then is being presented to the Court as a particular way that the defendant wants to run his case.</text>
