            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="37.924" offset="231605">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.697" offset="246756">This is the death knell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.512" offset="257936">The Court today in this matter is being asked to decide the validity of the so called death knell exception to the vulnerable final judgment rule of Section 1291 Title 28 United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.726" offset="318854">The death knell doctrine was first formulated by the Second Circuit in the original Eisen case in 1966, simply stated it permits an appeal by a class action plaintiff from an order refusing to certify the case for a class action treatment if the plaintiff can convince the Court of Appeals that he would abandon his individual claim if he is not permitted to represent the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.843" offset="427314">Under those circumstances the Court of Appeals in Eisen deemed the refusal to certify to be a final judgment because it sounded the so called death knell of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.811" offset="475170">The purpose for the death knell doctrine as originally conceived and as the word has been applied is not to create some special right of action or special right of appeal in a class action plaintiff as the respondents in this case seem to indicate, rather the only purpose for the death knell doctrine was to make sure that an order refusing to certify the class action would not ultimately go unreviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.846" offset="619366">In other words, the question is when the order refusing to certify is issued does that whatever mean that this matter will not be maintained as a class action and I think it is important to bear that purpose of the death knell doctrine in mind throughout our discussion in this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.870" offset="679448">In the intervening 12 years since Eisen want the death knell doctrine frankly has not faired well.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.316" offset="705152">Its validity has repeatedly been questioned by the Second Circuit itself including in particular of Judge Henry Friendly who has called for its abolishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.506" offset="746008">The doctrine has been rejected flatly by the Third Circuit and the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.186" offset="768682">It has been applied and modified form by the Fifth Circuit and in very limited form by the Ninth Circuit and we are hear this morning asking this Court to uphold the judgment of the Third Circuit and the Seventh Circuit to reverse the judgment of the Eighth Circuit in the Eisen case, and if the Court will to sound the death knell for the death knell doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.341" offset="869306">It might be appropriate and helpful at this point to review in summary fashion the facts of the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.361" offset="901384">This is an action brought in 1973 under the Securities Act 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.540" offset="938060">The complaint charged that a registration statement and a prospectus issued by the co-petitioner Punta Gorda Oils, Inc. contains certain false statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.212" offset="996783">Although the original complaint made class action allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.626" offset="1014442">The plaintiffs themselves waited more than nine months before they initially requested the Court to certify a class and even at that time they did not request a hearing on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.961" offset="1059791">Eventually, some 18 months after the action was originally filed, they finally requested a hearing after being prompted to do so by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.595" offset="1102318">The hearing was held promptly and within one month after the final brief was filed by the parties on the class action question, the District Court in St. Louis certified the case for class action treatment; however, at the same time, the District Court issued an order to the attorney for the class action plaintiffs to show cause why they should not be enjoined from representing the class and the background of that was that it came out in the hearing on the class action question that those attorneys who were representing the plaintiffs in this purported to represent the class had in fact represented one of the underwriters who was involved in the offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.826" offset="1291236">It was on unrelated matters but they had had a continuing relationship with that underwriter and there are refusal to join the underwriters as defendants in the lawsuit caused some questions to come up about whether that judgment was a fair one or whether it might have been contended a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.855" offset="1367409">So at the time that the trial judge certified the matter for a class action treatment he also issued an order to show cause to the attorneys why they should not be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.241" offset="1404921">They chose not to contest that and they withdrew from the action at which time present counsel for the respondents appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.268" offset="1436999">Immediately upon the appearance of new counsel, the trial judge inquired other than whether they intended to join the underwriters in the lawsuit and the judges’ view at that time what we are still not clear who the parties to this case were going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.771" offset="1507007">He was not given an answer to that question until late in October 1975, at which time it became clear to him that the reasoning underwriters had not been joined was that the statute limitations had entirely run against them while initial counsel for the respondents had been struggling to keep the conflict of interest from coming to the Court’s attention, at that time --</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="421.194" offset="1764679">Well, a standard procedure in securities cases Your Honor to join the underwriters their liability is virtually automatic if you establish the other elements of liability under Section 11 for instance of the 33 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.596" offset="1810341">It is a fairly routine matter that the trial court just wanted to know why it was not done and never really did get a satisfactory answer and was caused to become concerned that there were other reasons just in the merits of the case --</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="451.721" offset="1886828">A small percentage Your Honor that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.565" offset="1902188">In its October 23, 1975 order the trial court expressly said that he was concerned about the adequacy of the representation of the class that was being interpreted by these respondents and he directed at that time that a notice be sent to the class advising them of what had happened today in the lawsuit and specifically requesting petitions either for intervention or for appointment of a new class representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.531" offset="2010021">It also at that time the Court directed the respondents to initiate discovery as to the names and addresses of the class members for the purpose of sending this notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.039" offset="2068117">He had stayed discovery up to point on the merit, until the class action question could finally result.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.540" offset="2094135">Again however the respondents did not comply with the order and in fact they waited more than six months been into and formally requested the names and addresses of the class members and more than nine months before they actually initiated the discovery procedures under the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.650" offset="2158501">At that point in a motion to decertify the class was filed and on September 01, 1976 the Court exacerbated with the behavior of the respondents and vitally concerned about both their adequacy of representation and that the delays that had occurred decertified the class and ordered that the respondents’ individual claims could proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.590" offset="2250348">At that time, the respondents did not ask for a Section 1292 (b) certification instead they filed a notice of appeal to the Eighth Circuit under Section 1291 and in a separate independent proceeding they asked the Court to issue a writ of mandamus against the decertification order.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.898" offset="2323490">The Eighth Circuit denied our motion to dismiss the appeal and after argument on the merits held that decertification order was appealed under death knell doctrine and then ruled that the District Court had erred in decertifying the case and it ordered to recertify it without any discussion of whether it should have been in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.195" offset="2416695">In permitting the appeal, the Eighth Circuit took note of the fact that the respondents’ individual claim was in the amount of $2,650 and that the expenses of prosecuting the action would exceed that amount and therefore held that the death knell doctrine that the death knell of a case has sounded and it denied a mandamus petition as moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.992" offset="2507915">Primary question presented to this Court on certiorari deals with the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to entertain the appeal from the decertification order.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.191" offset="2544695">Secondary question presented in our petition is that if jurisdiction is found to exist in the Court of Appeals, did the Eighth Circuit overstepped the permissible bounce of judicial appellate review in substituting its judgment for that of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.008" offset="2603941">I will confine my oral remarks primarily to the first point which I think is of most interest to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.590" offset="2630272">I think the second point has been adequately briefed and relied principally on our briefs in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.912" offset="2659634">We submit that the death knell doctrine has an improper reading of Section 1291 of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.691" offset="2686697">Section 1291 of course embodies the final judgment rule which traces through its back to the first judiciary act of 1789, it has been described as the dominant rule of federal appellate jurisdiction designed to prevent peace appeals and undue litigiousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.244" offset="2764960">In Carroll v. United States which perhaps the closest case on its facts to the instant merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.579" offset="2790246">The Court held that the judgment is final only if determination of the action is the necessary result of the order and it also held that appealability cannot depend on the facts of the given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.878" offset="2847402">Well, the death knell doctrine in our view violates these principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.391" offset="2873525">The order which decertified the class in the present case did not act in anyway upon the claim of the individual respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.386" offset="2909469">They came into Court with a claim for $2,650 after the class action was certified, they still had a claim for $2,650.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.500" offset="3029946">Well, that is not clear either.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.526" offset="3037992">The record that was made in the District Court of course was not made with a view to our determining whether the death knell would eventually sound and it never is with the few exceptions, but the record does show in this case that the individual respondent sees in Livesay acknowledged in his deposition where he would have asked, “Will you continue to proceed with this case if it does not go forward on a class basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="764.722" offset="3138824">”He said, “Well, I will have to think about that, but I have to leave that decision up to my lawyer, if my lawsuit then yes I will proceed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="772.609" offset="3170380">Well, he personally did not considered the claim to be unviable and it shows that the decision is really that of the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.306" offset="3193159">It is an economic decision by the lawyer rather than an order which acts upon a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.575" offset="3226282">The decertification order did not act upon their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.355" offset="3237358">It created a situation in which the lawyer had to make the decision whether he wanted to undertake this claim under these facts at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.837" offset="3271317">Furthermore, the respondents in an earlier petition for mandamus to the Court of Appeals had told the Court that they intended to continue with the claim even if class action certification was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.165" offset="3320637">So there they were trying to get the Court that act under representation that they did intend to pursue the matter on an individualized basis and in fact after the decertification order was issued by the Court of Appeals they did continue, while they engaged in considerable discovery at a time when the only thing that was pending for their individual claims and respondents sees in Livesay in opposition to the certification order filed an affidavit in which he said, “I do intend I am committed to this case and I do intend to follow it up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="841.253" offset="3444979">We think that the death knell doctrine is a judicially created exception to the finality requirement which in practice primarily applies to any trust and securities claims and which ordinarily does not apply to such cases as Civil Rights Actions or adversity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.928" offset="3515614">We think it ignores the teachings of this Court in Baltimore Contractors v. Bodinger and Liberty Mutual v. Wetzel and which hold that the amendments to the finality requirement of Section 1291 are really matters for Congress and in that area Section 1292 (b) has been created as the vehicle for review of interlocutory orders and that further judicial exceptions to the finality requirement are unwarned and unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.399" offset="3649570">We think that there are a number of reasons most of which are set forth in our brief at some length, why the death knell doctrine is inadvisable, improper and unwarned.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.981" offset="3699830">Reason number one has to do with the language of rule 23 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.954" offset="3719788">Rule 23 in its own terms provides that any order certifying or refusing to certify a class action is conditional and it provides that it may be altered or amended at any time by definition therefore the class action determination is not final, moreover even if rule 23 did not so provide general concepts of judicial husbandry reveal that the trial court has continuing jurisdiction over prior orders and has the power to amend them anytime prior to final disposition of a case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.315" offset="7729166">So we have to assume that these things are going to occur quickly, but the out of pocket expenses incurred during that part of the case are certainly a lot less than were actually incurred after one and half years of litigation and that changes the circumstances in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.179" offset="8228627">What happened was that the District Court decertified the class using a standard that is not mentioned in rule 23, he decertified on the grounds that the actions of plaintiff’s counsel had caused a delay in the litigation thereby taking away rights from the defendants to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.599" offset="8330295">The record indicates that the only delay that was involved in that particular aspect of the case was approximately three months where there was a dispute between counsel over the production of transfer records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.632" offset="8386511">We have relied upon a letter received from Punta Gorda’s counsel in August 1975, promising to deliver the transfer records at our request after judge has fashioned an order which took something like four months for us to that after we submitted suggested forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.847" offset="8463311">We call the counsel for Punta Gorda and they refused to produce these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.953" offset="8487761">The record at the hearing on the motion for class certification also indicated that those records were readily available to counsel for Punta Gorda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.265" offset="8533006">We argued with them telephonically about this issue and then we sought the assistance of the Court by asking for a conference on this issue when we got to that conference, we were met with a motion by defendant Coopers &amp; Lybrand that decertified the class with failure to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.861" offset="8615343">Three years after the litigation was commenced then after an enormous amount of work was performed by both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.951" offset="8647735">It was a shocking type of a motion to me and frankly that gave a little credence at the time, I guess I should have treated it with more seriousness because the judge granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.092" offset="8688277">We did put in papers in response we also had motion’s request for production then pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.285" offset="8713041">There was a stay on discovery at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.246" offset="8724953">So there we were with the respondent with clients whose losses were approximately $2,650.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.258" offset="8764973">They had already been required to incur substantial out of pocket courses and they had not as yet taken their first deposition of a defendant in the case nor were they able to receive the first document in a discovery from defending Coopers &amp; Lybrand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.118" offset="8828398">The economic reality caused by the decertification order was that to continue the litigation with the major portion of the case on the merits still ahead of us would require an expenditure of respondent’s plot of funds far in excess of the amount of their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.811" offset="8903213">That is clear from the record that even if respondents succeeded in winning their case on the merits at the trial the recovery could not reimburse the for the out of pocket requirements to complete the litigation on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.270" offset="8969041">Now, one of the problems with the death knell as I stated before is what standard to apply in these situations and I suggest to Your Honors that the standard should be this if a plaintiff in this kind of a case having one on the merits on an individual claim could not recoup the out of pocket expenses incurred by him during the prosecution of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.149" offset="9096519">It makes no economic sense for him to proceed and we are not talking about legal fees, legal fees as what he is concerned where at the beginning of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2271.324" offset="9165273">Well now, three years into litigation in this case, Chief Livesay and his wife have already incurred certain expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.197" offset="9200695">They looked down the road and they say we have two thirds of the case yet to go on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.243" offset="9224937">It is going to cost $15,000 to litigate it, we do not have a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.909" offset="9251582">The only reason we started this action as because we thought we would have a class so that if we won on the merits we would be reimbursed for the expenses that we laid out on behalf of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.521" offset="9294005">It makes no economic sense to bring the $2,650 action where if you personally get a judgment at the end for that amount with the taxable cause she cannot recover the $15,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.380" offset="12501423">Nine more federal practice paragraph 110, 128 of pages 315 and 316 are recognized us that while the procedure is set forth in the rule for mandamus as rule 21 of the rules of appellate procedure should be followed the Courts of Appeal cannot frequently do to treat a notice of appeal as a petition for mandamus, if the order sought to be reviewed is not applicable, but the question presented is subject to review by mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.730" offset="12626811">So the Court had the power to treat the 1291 appeal even if it found that it was not an appropriate appeal remedy as a mandamus petition and as such this case is we are now reviewing that decision and we say that the Eighth Circuit can again take the mandamus petition then.</text>
