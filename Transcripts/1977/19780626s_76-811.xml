            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80274">The judgment and opinion of the Court in 76-811, Regents of the University of California against Bakke, will be disposed of in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.115" offset="140669">Mr. Justice Powell will announce the judgment of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.992" offset="156238">There is no opinion of the Court supported by a majority and accordingly other justices will state their dissenting and concurring opinions in due course, following that.</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="30.111" offset="200646">As the Chief Justice has stated, I am authorized to announce only the Judgment of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.812" offset="231471">The facts in this case are too well known to be re-stated this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.751" offset="251219">Perhaps no case in modern memory has received as much media coverage and scholarly commentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.429" offset="281939">More than 60 briefs were filed with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.917" offset="295941">We also have received the advice through the media and the commentaries of countless extra judicial advocates.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.508" offset="334289">The case was argued some eight months ago and as we speak today with a notable lack of unanimity, it maybe fair to say that we needed all of this advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.134" offset="384757">In any event, it will be evident from the several opinions that the case intrinsically difficult, has received our most thoughtful attention over many months.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.437" offset="433972">So much for the introduction; as there are six separate opinions, I will state first the Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.606" offset="474618">Insofar, as the California Supreme Court held at Bakke must be admitted to the Davis Medical School, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.167" offset="520907">Insofar, as the California court prohibited Davis from considering race as a factor in admissions, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.793" offset="567405">I will now try to explain how we divided on these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.745" offset="587154">This may not be self evident from a hard examination of our various opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.778" offset="611291">The decision of the California Court presented us with two central questions; the first and the one widely perceived as the only ultimate question is whether the special admissions program discriminated unlawfully against Bakke either under the Constitution or under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.600" offset="718602">I will refer to this as Bakke admissions question.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.309" offset="737410">The second and broader question is whether it is ever permissible to consider race as a factor relevant to the admission of applicants to a State University.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.966" offset="792058">I will refer to this question generally as whether race maybe considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.870" offset="815673">As will be perceived at this point, if the answer to the second question were negative, that is that race may never validly considered, this answer disposes of both issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.360" offset="877636">Bakke would be admitted and the University could not in the future, give any consideration to race in its admissions program.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.380" offset="917760">If however, the second question were answered affirmatively, that is that race maybe considered, then it becomes necessarily to address the first question separately that is whether the “special admissions program” at Davis is compatible with Title VI and with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.770" offset="1007307">I have mentioned both Title VI, often referred to as a statutory issue and the Constitution under which is presented the Equal Protection issue arising under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.935" offset="1067912">The case is further complicated because if it were disposed of under Title VI, there would be no occasions to reach the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.829" offset="1115559">I will now state more specifically how the questions are decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.504" offset="1142204">The Chief Justice and justices Stewart, Rehnquist and Stevens in an opinion authorized by Mr. Justice Stevens have concluded that the only question before us is whether Bakke was unlawfully excluded from the Medical School because of his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.606" offset="1222661">In their view, Congress has answered that question in Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.272" offset="1245335">They would affirm the judgment of the California Court without addressing the question whether race maybe ever be considered as a factor in an admissions program.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.137" offset="1300819">Justices Brennan, White, Marshall, Blackmun and I have a different view as to Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.491" offset="1330181">We believe despite smaller and detailed provisions that it goes no further in prohibiting the use of race than the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.510" offset="1374276">The five of us therefore, reach both of the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.707" offset="1403010">On a constitutional analysis, founded on the Equal protection Clause, justices Brennan, White, Marshall and Blackmun, in that joint opinion, hold, not only that race properly maybe considered but also that the special admissions program of the Davis Medical School is valid in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.019" offset="1508336">When I have concluded, Mr. Justice Brennan will state this position more fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.261" offset="1525263">Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Blackmun also will make statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.161" offset="1548878">As I agree that Title VI does not dispose of this case, I also address the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.435" offset="1589943">On the first of these, whether the special admissions program is invalid, I agree with the result reached by Mr. Justice Stevens' opinion, but I do so on constitutional grounds rather than on under Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.014" offset="1656294">Thus there are five votes to affirm the judgment, invalidating the “special” program.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.132" offset="1684715">Under this judgment, Bakke will be admitted to the medical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.431" offset="1705926">As to the second constitutional issue, whether race may be considered as a factor in an admissions program, I agree with the result reached by the joint opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan and my brothers who have joined him.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.724" offset="1771128">Thus, there are five justices who join in a judgment of reversal on this issue, but the process of constitutional analysis by which I reach this result differs significantly from that of the four justices who have filed a joint opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.409" offset="1853884">As my reasoning is set forth fully in my written opinion, and as other justices will speak, I will merely make a brief conclusory summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.763" offset="1899232">The Davis “special admissions” program with sixteen of 100 seats reserved exclusively for three categories of minorities, is a classification based on race.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.110" offset="1956702">Our cases establish beyond question that a racial classification by a state agency is inherently suspect and must be subjected to the most exacting judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.847" offset="2015634">Although adopted primarily to protect persons of the Negro race, the guarantee of the Equal Protection Clause by its terms protects all persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.213" offset="2065058">It provides explicitly that no person shall be denied equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.258" offset="2101211">Despite this absolute language, our cases have held at some distinction are justified if necessary to further a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.976" offset="2144156">Davis relies on several interests thought to be compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.590" offset="2162547">One is the desire to readdress racial imbalance said to result from general societal discrimination against the minority groups selected for preferential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.223" offset="2213120">But there is a complete absence on this record of any finding that this imbalance is traceable to discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.498" offset="2254184">Discrimination by society at large, with no determined effects, is not sufficient to justify petitioner's racial classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.830" offset="2303503">In my view, the only state interest that fairly may be viewed as compelling on this record is the interest of a university in a diverse student body.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.540" offset="2350419">This interest, encompassed within the concept of academic freedom, is a special concern of the First Amendment, but there has been no showing in this case that the Davis “special” program is necessary to achieve educational diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.755" offset="2427219">The Davis program totally excludes all applicants who are not Negro, Asian or Chicano from 16 of the 100 seats in an entering class.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.990" offset="2480196">No matter how strong their qualifications, qualitative and quantitative, including their own potential for contributing to educational diversity, they are not afforded the opportunity to compete with the applicants from the preferred groups for those sixteen seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.428" offset="2565982">At the same time, the preferred applicants have the opportunity to compete for every seat in the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.180" offset="2608927">A university's interest in a a diverse student body is not limited to ethnic diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.914" offset="2639856">Rather it's compelling interest in this respect encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which race is only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.166" offset="2684891">I refer in my opinion to the Harvard Admissions Program as one example of how race properly, in my opinion, maybe taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.724" offset="2731076">I will quote briefly from the description of the Harvard program, a copy of which is in the Appendix to my opinion and here I quote in substance, “The Admission Committee has not set target-quotas for the number of blacks, or of musicians, football players, physicists or Californians to be admitted in a given year.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.748" offset="2835252">Awareness of the need for a diversity means only that in choosing among thousands of academically qualified applicants, the Committee, with a number of criteria in mind, pays some attention to distribution that should be made among many types and categories of students.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.497" offset="2926158">"Thus race is considered in a flexible program designed to achieve diversity, but it is only one factor weighed competitively against a number of other factors being relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.749" offset="2987180">Under such a system, each applicant is treated as an individual, regardless of race and is considered in competition for each seat in the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.684" offset="3034932">As the briefs in this case, and the literature in this area, abundantly illustrate many of our finest universities and colleges peruse a flexible, competitive admissions program in which race maybe considered as a relevant factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.574" offset="3106507">This experience demonstrates that the Davis type program, one that arbitrarily forecloses all competition solely on the basis of race or ethnic origin, is not necessary to attain reasonable educational diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.473" offset="3186129">In my view, it therefore violates the Equal Protection Clause in the most fundamental sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.429" offset="3217894">Yet, the way is open to Davis to adopt the type of admissions program, proved to be successful in so many of the universities and colleges of our country.</text>

          <heading>Opinion Announcement of Justice John Paul Stevens</heading>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="799.478" stopTime="1304.248">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="799.478" offset="3278184">The University of California through its special admissions policy excluded Allan Bakke from participation in it's program of medical education because of his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.356" offset="3333668">The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I are of the opinion that, that action violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.635" offset="3386749">Section 601 of that Act prohibits the exclusion of any person on the ground of race from any program receiving federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.313" offset="3429485">The Davis Medical School is such a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.691" offset="3442965">The language of the statue is exceptionally plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.973" offset="3456130">It provides, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="868.568" offset="3554455">The legislative history of the statute makes it clear that Congress meant exactly what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.913" offset="3583921">During the lengthy debates, opponents of the legislation expressed their concern that the Act would be read as mandating racial quotas in "racially balanced" colleges and universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.993" offset="3636166">In response, those supporting the legislation gave repeated assurances that the Act would be colorblind in it's application.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.992" offset="3676186">One supporter of the Act expressed this position in these words, “The basic fairness of Title VI is so clear that I find it difficult to understand why it should create any opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.566" offset="3734491">Private prejudices, to be sure, cannot be eliminated overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.534" offset="3754344">However, there is one area where no room at all exists for private prejudices, that is the area of governmental conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.058" offset="3788408">As the first Mr. Justice Harlan said in his prophetic dissenting opinion in Plessy against Ferguson, “Our Constitution is color-blind, so I say to Senators, must be our Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.731" offset="3843161">Title VI closes the gap between our purposes as a democracy and our prejudices as individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.438" offset="3873985">The cuts of prejudice need healing.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.388" offset="3885792">The costs of prejudice need understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.976" offset="3900107">We cannot have hostility between two great parts of our people without tragic loss in our human values.”</text>
            <text syncTime="963.628" offset="3934694">In words that would be paraphrased and repeated throughout the congressional debates, Senator Pastore, the floor manager of the Bill, clearly stated the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.615" offset="3978684">Title VI will guarantee that the money collected by colorblind tax collectors will be distributed by Federal and State administrators who are equally colorblind.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.328" offset="4025495">We cannot ignore the plain language in the legislative history and in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.824" offset="4051513">The simple rule set forth in the statute is not qualified by any words that say in substance that the prohibition against racial discrimination shall apply only if the racial discrimination is also unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.807" offset="4115461">In order to interpret this unusually clear colorblind statute, there is no need to decide whether the Constitution is also colorblind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.773" offset="4163317">In other provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Court has held that the statute has a meaning of its own that is not necessarily congruent with any constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.669" offset="4214935">Thus for example, in Washington against Davis, an employment discrimination case arising under Title VII, the Court stated, “We have never held that the constitutional standard for adjudicating claims of invidious racial discrimination is identical to the standards applicable under Title VII and we decline to do so today.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.275" offset="4309290">And in other Title VII cases, the Court has also squarely held that the statute prohibits racial discrimination against white petitioners upon the same standards as would be applicable where they Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.766" offset="4367281">Quoting from our earlier decision in Griggs against Duke Power, the Court reaffirmed the principle that the statute prohibits discriminatory preference for any racial group, minority or majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.463" offset="4422034">But the university argues that regardless of the principle of none-discrimination established by Title VI, an individual who was injured by a violation of Title VI, has no standing litigate his claim in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.694" offset="4482952">This contention was not raised until oral argument before us and has been repeatedly and consistently rejected in cases both in this Court and others where individuals have raised claims similar to Bakke's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.604" offset="4538645">In the context of this case, we find no merit in the argument that Bakke has no standing to a assert his statutory claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.275" offset="4573335">Two questions remain, first; even though the statutory ground to decision in this case is dispositive is it appropriate to discuss any constitutional issues presented by the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.778" offset="4631327">The Court has repeatedly given the same answer to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.282" offset="4649299">To quote only one such answer in Spector Motor Co. against McLaughlin, “If there is one doctrine, more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable."</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.463" offset="4726099">The more important the issue, the more force there is to this doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.970" offset="4756088">In our view, we have a clear duty to avoid unnecessary discussion of constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.918" offset="4787853">Finally, should the Court volunteer its views about university admissions programs other than the one which resulted in the rejection of Bakke's application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.909" offset="4831843">Again, the answer is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.274" offset="4841352">It is well settle that this Court reviews judgments not statements and opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.951" offset="4867996">This lawsuit is between two specific litigants; Allan Bakke and the Regents of the University of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.411" offset="4897881">The judgment now before us, as we explain in our opinion, declares that the university's special admissions program was unlawful and orders that Bakke be admitted to the medical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.268" offset="4949290">The specific holding of the California Supreme Court that is under review in this case is limited to the conclusion that the “special admissions” program employed by that university was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.447" offset="5002057">No other issue remains in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.549" offset="5014387">Just as we have a duty to decide that issue, so too we have a duty, equally strong and equally ingrained in the constitutional structure of our government, to avoid discussion of important issues not presented by the controversy before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.017" offset="5084290">75 years ago, in one of his classic dissenting opinions, Mr. Justice Holmes observed that in great cases, the interest at stake generates a kind of hydraulic pressure which makes what previously was clear seem doubtful and before which even well settled principle of law were abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.248" offset="5177182">Not withstanding the pressures that tempt us to speak about other issues, well settled principles dictate a course of judicial restrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.291" offset="5217410">For these reasons, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Rehnquist and I have concluded that the Court should simply affirm the judgment of the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.867" offset="5263699">To the extent that the Court today purports to do anything else, we believe, it exceeds it's proper judicial role.</text>

          <heading>Opinion Announcement of Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</heading>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="1304.248" stopTime="2395.680">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1304.248" offset="5297241">As my brother Powell has already said, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and I have filed a jointly signed opinion supporting our views that the judgment of the California Supreme Court should be reserved in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.131" offset="5396715">Not only insofar as it prohibits the university from establishing “race conscious programs in the future,” but also insofar as the judgment orders that respondent Bakke be admitted to the Davis Medical School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.828" offset="5459513">As is apparent from the statements of both my brother Powell and my brother Stevens, all nine members of the Court addressed the threshold question of statutory construction and a majority, consisting of Mr. Justice Powell and the four of us, construe the statute as going no further in prohibiting the use of race then the Equal Protection Clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.881" offset="5583752">Now that then is a law of statutory construction for the purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.461" offset="5618024">Although it may strike some as unusual, that the dissenters in that construction rests their affirmance of the California Supreme Court on their construction of Title VI, that is not the law, having being rejected by a majority of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.514" offset="5686256">The dissenters have chosen not to address the constitutional question required by the majority's controlling construction namely whether the Davis program violates the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.026" offset="5744352">Our brother Powell, as he said, also affirms the California Supreme Court insofar, it directed Bakke's admission but on the ground, even though I know I am repeating I think it's important that it be emphasized, reaching the constitution, Davis's special admission program was unnecessary in his view to the achievement of the compelling goal of achieving a diverse student body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.466" offset="5858037">So in consequence, only five members of the Court addressed the constitutional question of uniquely paramount importance that this case presents, what race conscious programs are permissible under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.975" offset="5936091">Although it's no secret that the Court took this case as the vehicle for confronting that issue after avoiding it on mootness grounds in the DeFunis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.376" offset="5981753">But the fact that only five of us addressed the constitutional question must not obscure the signal importance of today's decision on the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.583" offset="6046537">Five of us, a Court majority, reversed the judgment of the California Supreme Court insofar as it prohibits Davis from establishing race conscious admissions programs in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.743" offset="6111216">Thus the central meaning of today's opinions is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.846" offset="6131592">Government may take race into account when it acts not to demean or insult any racial group, but to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice, at least when appropriate findings have been made by judicial, legislative or administrative bodies with competence to act in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.159" offset="6240888">Now the opinion of the four of us, is some 55 printed pages and of course, I shall only briefly touch up it's highlights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.316" offset="6293446">The first half addresses the threshold question of the construction of Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.656" offset="6314867">Although the dissenters have that there is a private right of action under Title VI, three of the four of us agree with our brother Powell that this case doesn't require us to decide that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.494" offset="6366171">Our brother White however, believes we should address it and accordingly he has filed a separate opinion stating his view that there is no private right of action under Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.807" offset="6423432">The rest of our statutory construction discussion canvases in great detail the legislative history that contrary to the view just expressed by my brother Stevens in our view establishes beyond question that Title VI was not indented to bar State affirmative action programs not bared by the Equal Protection Clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.831" offset="6531578">In other words, the legislative history contrary to the dissenters reading, provides no support for the proposition that Congress intended to impose statutory limitations upon constitutionally permissible racial preferences designed to extend the benefits of federally financed programs to racial minorities that historically have been excluded from the full benefits of American life as a result of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.121" offset="6652682">In sum, in our brother Powell's words and his opinion and I quote them, “ In view of the clear legislative intent, Title VI must be held to proscribe only those racial classifications that would violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Fifth Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.508" offset="6738259">Our discussion of the constitutional question, takes up the second half of our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.125" offset="6772741">It opens with a history of our national betrayal of our founding principle that all men are created equal, for candor requires acknowledgment that the Framers of our Constitution, to forge the 13 Colonies into one Nation, openly compromised this principle of equality with its antithesis slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.921" offset="6879947">The consequences of this compromise are well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.460" offset="6894054">They have have aptly been called our 'American Dilemma'.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.438" offset="6909936">Thus we think it well to recount how brief the time has been if it has yet come, when the promise of our principles has flowered into the actuality of equal opportunity for all regardless of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.298" offset="6977436">The Fourteenth Amendment, the embodiment in the Constitution of our abiding belief in human equality, has been the law of our land for only slightly more than half of our 200 years as a nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.415" offset="7033861">And for half of that half, the Equal Protection Clause of the Amendment was largely moribund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.139" offset="7060819">Worst the clause was only turned against those whom it was intended to set free, condemning them to a "separate but equal" status before the law, a status always separate, but seldom equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.445" offset="7122050">Not until 1954, only 24 years ago, was this odious doctrine interred by our decision in Brown v. Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.644" offset="7162801">Brown I, and its progeny which proclaimed that separate schools and public facilities of all sorts were inherently unequal and forbidden under our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.488" offset="7206165">Even then, inequality was not eliminated with "all deliberate speed."</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.922" offset="7231869">In 1968 and again in 1971 we were forced to remind school boards of their obligation to eliminate racial discrimination root and branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.806" offset="7275441">And a glance at our docket and those of lower courts even today will show that officially sanctioned discrimination is not a thing of the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.265" offset="7329254">Against this background, claims that law must be "colorblind" or that the datum of race is no longer relevant to public policy must be seen as aspiration, rather than as descriptive of reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.227" offset="7389126">This is not to denigrate aspiration, but for reality rebukes us that race has too often been used by those who would stigmatize and oppress minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.028" offset="7432385">Yet we cannot and as our opinion attempts to demonstrate need not, under our Constitution, let color blindness become myopia which masks the reality that many "created equal" have been treated within our lifetimes as inferior both by the law and by their fellow citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.771" offset="7527262">The association of human equality is closely associated with a proposition that differences in color or creed, birth or status, are neither significant nor relevant to the way in which persons should be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.191" offset="7592986">Nonetheless, the position that such factors must be constitutionally in relevance, summed up by the short hand phrase or if Constitution is colorblind has never been adopted by this Court as the proper meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.245" offset="7665188">Our opinions cites numerous decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.441" offset="7682011">School desegregation cases, gender discrimination cases, decisions sustaining affirmative action programs of the Congress and Federal agencies supporting the conclusion that nothing whatever in the history of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Civil Rights Acts, even remotely suggests that the states are foreclosed from furthering the fundamental purpose of equal opportunity to which the Amendment and these Acts are addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.693" offset="7803010">Our opinion next turns to the problem of what the judicial role should be in reviewing state action that expressly classifies by race for remedial purposes as does the Davis program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.110" offset="7864659">Respondent Bakke argues that racial classifications are always suspect and consequently, that this Court should weigh the importance of the objective served by Davis's affirmative admission program to see if they are compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.597" offset="7926622">In addition, he asserts this Court must inquire whether in it's judgment there are alternatives other than racial classifications which would suit Davis' purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.381" offset="7973747">The university on the other hand, states that our proper role is simply to accept its determination that the racial classifications used by its program are reasonably related to what it tells us are its benign purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.069" offset="8040516">Our opinion adopts a standard somewhere in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.940" offset="8064026">Because of the significant risk that racial classifications established for ostensibly benign purposes can be misused, causing effects not unlike those created by invidious classifications, it is inappropriate to inquire only whether there is any conceivable basis that might sustain such a classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.778" offset="8159321">Rather to justify such a classification, an important and articulated purpose for its use must be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.191" offset="8201012">In addition, any statute must be stricken that stigmatizes any group or that singles out those least well represented in the political process to bear the brunt of a benign program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.150" offset="8252839">Thus, our review under the Fourteenth Amendment should be strict, not "strict' in theory and fatal in fact" because it is stigma that causes fatality, but strict and searching nonetheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.792" offset="8315428">The opinion next analyses the Davis problem by that standard and concludes that it passes constitutional muster as a permissible program to remove the disparate racial impact it's admissions program might otherwise have and was adopted on the basis of the reasonable belief that the disparate discrete impact is itself a product of past discrimination whether the universities or that of society at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.243" offset="8445205">It's not claimed that the Davis program operates to stigmatize or single out any discrete and insular, or even any identifiable, non-minority group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.685" offset="8490971">Bakke was not in any sense stamped as inferior by the Medical School's rejection of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.678" offset="8518974">Indeed, it is conceded by all that he satisfied those criteria regarded by the school as generally relevant to academic performance better than most of the minority members who were admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.705" offset="8567040">In addition there is simply no evidence that the Davis program discriminates intentionally or unintentionally against any minority group which it purports to benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.582" offset="8610507">The program does not establish a quota in the invidious sense of a ceiling on the number of minority applicants to be admitted nor can the program reasonably be regarded as stigmatizing the program's beneficiaries or their race as inferior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.546" offset="8674455">It's uncontested that Davis admits only those minority applicants in the special program who are fully qualified to study medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.122" offset="8712698">Once admitted, these students must satisfy the same degree requirements as regularly admitted students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.662" offset="8738821">They are taught by the same faculty in the same classes and their performance is evaluated by the same standards by which regularly admitted students are judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.837" offset="8779572">Under these circumstances, their performance and degrees must be regarded equally with the regularly admitted students with whom they compete or standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.159" offset="8824816">Our opinion finally comes to our reasons for disagreeing that the set aside those 16 places under the Davis program requires the conclusion that Bakke was unconstitutionally denied admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.215" offset="8881032">Davis's special admissions program cannot in our view, be said to violate the Constitution simply because it has set aside a predetermined number of places for qualified minority applicants, rather than, as thus the Harvard Program approved by our brother Powell, using race as positive factor to be considered in evaluating the applications of disadvantaged minority applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.180" offset="9000986">We think that for purposes of constitutional adjudication, there is simply, no difference between the two approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.261" offset="9033273">It's inescapable that in any admissions program which extends the preference to disadvantaged racial minorities, a decision must be made as to how much of a preferences is to be given and any given preference that results in the exclusion of a white candidate is no more or less constitutionally acceptable than a program such as that at Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.462" offset="9122090">Furthermore, the extent of the preference inevitably depends on how many minority applicants the particular school is seeking to admit in any particular year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.554" offset="9170468">There is no sensible, and certainly no constitutional distinction as we see, between, for example, adding a set number of points to the admissions rating of disadvantaged minority applicants as an expression of the preference with the expectation that this will result in the admission of an approximately determined number of qualified minority applicants and setting a fixed number of places for such qualified applicants, as was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.547" offset="9294393">A "Harvard" program as those employing it readily concede, openly and successfully employs a racial criterion for the purpose of ensuring that some of the scarce places in institutions of higher education are allocated to disadvantaged minority students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.042" offset="9376418">That the Harvard approach does not also make public the extent of the preference and the precise workings of the system, while the Davis program employs a specific, openly stated number, does not, in our view, condemn the latter plan for purposes of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.409" offset="9457815">It may be that the Harvard plan is more acceptable to the public generally than is the Davis "quota."</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.308" offset="9489476">If it is, any State, including California, is free to adopt it in preference to a less acceptable alternative, just as it is generally free, as far as the Constitution is concerned, to abjure granting any racial preferences in its admissions programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.128" offset="9572754">But there is no basis for preferring a particular preference program simply because in achieving the same goals that the Davis Medical School is pursuing, it proceeds in a manner that is not immediately apparent to the public.</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="2395.680" stopTime="3031.354">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="2395.680" offset="9662929">Mr. Justice Powell has stated that this case is intrinsically difficult; perhaps so, perhaps not. I suspect that for those four members of the Court who find the Title VI issue controlling, the case really is not very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.403" offset="9741818">But for the five of us who feel that Title VI does not provide the answer, the case has much deeper and more profound ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.019" offset="9784346">This case like the death penalty issues that had been before the Court in years last past, like the abortion cases, like the schools' desegregation cases has caught the popular interest and the peoples' deep concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.613" offset="9850697">Like each of those it finds the people as well as justices divided in their in their eight reactions; strands of heritage and strands of emotion and strands of presumption all are plucked (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.666" offset="9918929">For me, this case is distinctly a constitutional, not a statutory case and because it is, I have joined my brother Brennan and White and Marshall in the opinion Mr. Justice Brennan has just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.467" offset="9986116">What I have written separately, I believe and I hope is complementary to what is said in the opinion for the four of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.631" offset="10022792">I emphasis, however, a number of very general factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.276" offset="10045361">First, until just a few years ago, in the early 1970s, a very small number, less than 2%, of all the physicians and all the attorneys and all the students in medical and law schools in this country, were members of what we refer to as minority groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.076" offset="10140552">And in addition to this factor, almost three quarters of our Negro physicians where trained at only two medical schools; Harvard here in Washington and Meharry in Nashville Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.622" offset="10206694">If ways are not found to remedy that kind of situation, the country will never achieve it's professed goal of a society that is not race-conscious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.380" offset="10261760">Second, I am optimistic that remedy will be forthcoming and I am optimistic that we shall see a time when race consciousness is a far less significant factor in our national life than it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.384" offset="10325707">When that time will come, I do not know, but when it comes, affirmative action, so called a reverse discrimination will be a thing of the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.182" offset="10380983">Third; in this case we are considering not a demarcation between the qualified on the one hand and the unqualified on the other, but we are considering a process of selection among those who are qualified to go to medical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.361" offset="10453707">It follows when all those qualified cannot be admitted as is sadly the case today, that there is a denial to the deserving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.057" offset="10492473">This inescapable fact is brought into sharp focus here because Allan Bakke is not himself charged with discrimination and yet he is one who is disadvantaged, and because the Medical School at Davis itself was not charged with historical discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.835" offset="10571572">Next; for me there is particular or very real significance in the 84-16 division at Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.779" offset="10611383">The same legal and constitutional considerations necessarily apply if the Davis Special Administration Program had focused on any lesser number, that is, on 12 or 8 or 4 or indeed, on only one place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.136" offset="10684734">It is somewhat ironic to have us so deeply disturbed by this case which concerns a program where race is an element of consciousness, and yet for all of us to be aware of the fact, and to know that our institutions of higher learning long have given and still do give conceded preference up to a point to accomplished or promising athletes, to the children of alumni, to the affluent and to those who have connections with celebrities, and the famous, and the powerful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.232" offset="10833110">Next; it seems to me that the programs of admission are basically a responsibility for academicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.106" offset="10864666">The judiciary is ill-equipped and poorly trained for this task.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.856" offset="10883683">Management of a university or of a professional school is within the special competence of educators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.954" offset="10912000">Interference by the judiciary, therefore, must be the rare exception, and not the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.892" offset="10943765">Next; I agree with Mr. Justice Powell that today's philosophical conception of the Fourteenth Amendment as he has set forth in his opinion, embraces a so called “broader principle” than the Amendment did when it was adopted in 1868, 110 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.743" offset="11031223">But for me that enlargement does not mean, not the Fourteenth Amendment has broken away from its moorings and from its original intended purpose, those original aims still persist and that, in a distinct sense, is what "affirmative action," is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.588" offset="11110530">If this conflicts with idealistic equality or with pure equal protection, any such tension of that kind is original Fourteenth Amendment tension, and it is constitutionally conceived and constitutionally proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.622" offset="11186703">I am not convinced as Mr. Justice Powell is that the difference between the Davis Program and those employed by the Amici here Harvard and Stanford and Pennsylvania and Columbia, is constitutionally significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.753" offset="11247203">Certainly, the line between the two is a thin is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.754" offset="11263190">And I say this because in each program subjective application is at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.472" offset="11290148">I do agree that the Harvard type program where race or ethnic background is only one of many factors, is a program probably better formulated than two-track system at Davis and yet the cynical may say that under the Harvard program, one may accomplish covertly what Davis says it does openly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.558" offset="11386488">I think it is worth noting that governmental preference is not a stranger to our legal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.775" offset="11411356">We certainly see it in veterans' preference legislation, we certainly see it in the aid-to-the-handicapped programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.231" offset="11441136">We see it in the progressive income tax, we see it in the Indian programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.160" offset="11464855">We accept some of these on the the ground that they have special constitutional protection or as with Indians, that they are wards of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.913" offset="11499859">Nevertheless, the preferences exist, and we have accepted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.953" offset="11523996">I suspect that it would be impossible to arrange an affirmative action program in a racially neutral way and to have it successful, that almost demands the impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.328" offset="11569554">In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.544" offset="11594423">And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.645" offset="11614798">We cannot and I think we dare not let the Equal Protection Clause of all the provisions in the Constitution perpetuate racial supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.678" offset="11666938">And so for me the ultimate question, as it was at the very beginning, it is this; among the qualified, how does one choose?</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.798" offset="11711451">And putting that one in the framework of constitutional considerations and requirements, it seems to me that we get back to basics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.329" offset="11749590">At the risk of being repetitious, I think it brings back what a very Great Chief Justice, known as the Great Chief Justice, said a long time ago, or he pointed the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.462" offset="11822106">“In considering this question, then, we must never forget, that it is a Constitution, we are expounding."</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.222" offset="11853139">And later in McCulloch against Maryland, he went on, in words that I think are particularly appropriate for this case, "Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means, all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adopted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional."</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.848" offset="11983647">More recently, one destined to become a Justice of this Court said this, “The great generalities of the Constitution have a content and a significance that vary from age to age."</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.724" offset="12043102">Well, those are precepts of breadth and flexibility and ever-present modernity so far as our Constitution is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.335" offset="12077583">They are precepts basic to our constitutional law and today again, for the four of us anyway, or five of us I think, we expound a Constitution and the same principles that governed McCulloch's case in 1819, govern Bakke's case in 1977 and 78.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.353" offset="12173610">For me there can be no other answer and there is no alternative.</text>

          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3031.354" stopTime="3845.441">
            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="3031.354" offset="12205688">And some of what I have to say will be repetitious but I feel obliged to say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.381" offset="12237766">I agree with the judgment of the Court,, this Court only insofar as it permits a university to consider the race of an applicant in making admissions decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.987" offset="12292205">I do not agree that petitioner's admissions program violates the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.688" offset="12318955">For it must be remembered that, during most of the past 200 years, the Constitution, as interpreted by this Court, did not prohibit the most ingenious and pervasive forms of discrimination against the Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.304" offset="12389485">Now, when a State acts to remedy the effects of that legacy of discrimination, I cannot believe that this same Constitution stands as a barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.310" offset="12449463">Three hundred and fifty years ago, the Negro was dragged to this country in chains to be sold into slavery and the system of slavery brutalized and dehumanized both master and slave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.350" offset="12505574">An implicit protection of slavery was embodied in the Declaration of Independence and was made explicit in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.252" offset="12549250">The individual States likewise established the machinery to protect the system of slavery through the promulgation of the Slave Codes, which were designed primarily to defend the property interest of the owner and his slave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.841" offset="12615601">The position of the Negro slave as mere property was then confirmed by this Court in Dred Scott against Sandford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.599" offset="12654576">The status of the Negro as property was officially erased by his emancipation at the end of the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.866" offset="12691670">But the long-awaited emancipation, while freeing the Negro from slavery, did not bring him citizenship or equality in any meaningful way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.817" offset="12731481">Despite the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, the Negro was systematically denied the rights that those Amendments were supposed to secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.378" offset="12785711">The combined actions and inactions of the State and Federal Governments maintained Negroes in a position of legal inferiority for another century after the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.739" offset="12843180">The Southern States took the first steps and immediately following the end of the Civil War, many of the provisional legislatures passed Black Codes, similar to the Slave Codes, which, among other things, limited the rights of a Negro to own or rent property and permitted imprisonment for breach of employment contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.527" offset="12938370">Congress responded to these legal disabilities by enacting the Reconstruction Acts and the Civil Rights Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.342" offset="12973583">Thus for a time back there, it seemed as if the Negro might be protected from the continued denial of his civil rights and might be relieved of the disability that prevented him from taking his rightful place as a free and equal citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.880" offset="13047771">That time, however, was short-lived. Reconstruction came to a close, and, with the assistance of this Court, the Negro was rapidly stripped of his new civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.641" offset="13114749">The Court began by interpreting the Civil War Amendments in a manner that sharply curtailed their substantive protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.404" offset="13161874">Then in the notorious Civil Rights cases, the Court strangled Congress' efforts to use its power to promote racial equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.281" offset="13205342">The Court's ultimate blow to the Civil War Amendments and to the equality of Negroes was of course, Plessy against Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.371" offset="13245675">In upholding that Louisiana law, they said that, “equal but separate" accommodations for whites and Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.596" offset="13282560">The Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended "to abolish distinctions upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political equality, or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either."</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.063" offset="13356434">Ignoring totally the realities of the positions of the two races, Mr. Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion recognized the bankruptcy of the Court's reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.426" offset="13401887">He expressed his fear that if like laws were enacted in other States, “the effect would be in the highest degree mischievous."</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.590" offset="13446609">The fears of Mr. Justice Harlan were soon to be realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.984" offset="13464163">In the wake of Plessy, many States began expand their Jim Crow laws, which had up until that time been limited primarily to passenger trains and schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.123" offset="13512751">The segregation of the races was extended to residential areas, parks, hospitals, theaters, waiting rooms, and bathrooms, you name it, The enforced segregation of the races continued into the middle of the 20th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.835" offset="13575549">In both World Wars, Negroes were for the most part confined to separate military units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.255" offset="13601254">It was not until 1948 that an end to segregation in the military was ordered by President Truman and the history of the exclusion of Negro children from white public schools is too well known and recent to require repeating here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.735" offset="13671157">That Negroes were deliberately excluded from public graduate and professional schools and thereby denied the opportunity to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, and the like is too well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.565" offset="13722462">The position of the Negro today in America is a tragic, but inevitable consequence of centuries of unequal treatment measured by any benchmark of comfort or achievement, meaningful equality remains a distant dream for the Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.183" offset="13804904">A Negro child today has a life expectancy which is shorter by more than five years than of a white child, that's today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.263" offset="13849312">The median income of the Negro family is only 60% of the median of a white family, and the percentage of Negroes who live in families with incomes below the poverty line is nearly four times greater than that of whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.326" offset="13913574">Today, when the Negro child reaches working age, he finds that America offers him significantly less than it offers his white counterpart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.438" offset="13961952">For Negro adults, the unemployment rate is twice that of whites, at least whites and the unemployment rate for Negro teenagers is three to four times that of white teenagers, I am talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.462" offset="14022034">The relationship between those figures and the history of unequal treatment afforded to the Negro cannot be denied and I haven't heard it denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.569" offset="14062472">At every point from birth to death, the impact of the past is reelected to the still disfavored position of the Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.989" offset="14104163">In light of the sorry history of discrimination and the devastating impact on the lives of Negroes, bringing the Negro into the mainstream of American life should be a state interest of the highest order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.542" offset="14166439">To fail to do so is to ensure that America will remain a divided society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.957" offset="14200085">I do not believe that the Fourteenth Amendment requires us to accept that fate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.097" offset="14224640">Neither its history nor our past cases lend support to the conclusion that a university may not remedy the cumulative effects of society's discrimination by giving consideration to race in an effort to increase the number and percentage of Negro doctors in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.540" offset="14306351">The experience of Negroes in America has been different in kind, not just in degree, from that of other ethnic groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.896" offset="14347833">It's not merely the history of slavery alone, but also that a whole people were marked as inferior by the law and that mark has endured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.213" offset="14401123">The dream of America as great melting pot has not been realized for the Negro because of his skin color, he never even made it into the pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.699" offset="14455040">These differences in the experience of the Negro make it difficult for me to accept that Negroes cannot be afforded greater protection under the Fourteenth Amendment where it is necessary to remedy the effects of past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.365" offset="14517734">In the Civil Rights Cases, this Court wrote that the Negro, emerging from slavery must cease "to be the special favorite of the laws."</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.499" offset="14562246">We cannot in light of the history of the last century yield to that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.138" offset="14580741">Had this Court been willing in 1896, in  Plessy and Ferguson to hold that the Equal Protection Clause forbids difference in treatment based on race, we would not be faced with this dilemma in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.583" offset="14638524">We must remember, however, that the principle that the "Constitution is color-blind" appeared only in the dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.016" offset="14680320">The majority of the Court rejected the principle of color blindness, and for the next 60 years, from Plessy to Board of Education, ours was a Nation where, by law, an individual could be given "special" treatment based on the color of his skin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.069" offset="14764538">It is because of a legacy of unequal treatment that we now must permit the institutions of this society to give consideration to race to making decisions about who will hold the positions of influence, prestige and influence in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.098" offset="14832666">Far too long, the doors to those positions have been shut to Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.064" offset="14852519">If we are ever to become a fully integrated society, one in which the color of a person's skin will not determine the opportunities available to him, we must be willing to take steps to open those doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.755" offset="14911242">I do not believe that anyone can truly look into America's past and still find that a remedy for the effects of that past is impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.771" offset="14955337">It has been said that this case involves only the individual, Bakke and nobody else and on the other hand it says it only involves Davis University.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.677" offset="14998909">I doubt, however, that there is a computer capable of determining the number of persons and institutions that may be affected by the decision in this case today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.911" offset="15051885">For example, we are told by the Attorney General of the United States that at least 27 federal agencies have adopted regulations, requiring recipients of federal funds to take "affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin."</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.518" offset="15150315">I cannot even guess the number of state and local governments that have set up similar affirmative-action programs, which may be affected by today's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.274" offset="15201306">I for one, fear that we have come full circle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.732" offset="15219174">After the Civil War our Government started several "affirmative action" programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.740" offset="15251147">This Court in the Civil Rights Cases and Plessy against Ferguson destroyed the movement toward complete equality through affirmative actions and then for almost a century, no action was taken and this non-action was with the tacit approval of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.902" offset="15351876">Then we had Brown versus Eduction and the Congressional Civil Rights Act followed by numerous affirmative-action programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.448" offset="15393985">But now today, we have this Court again stepping in this time to stop affirmative-action program of the type used by the university of California in doing so I cannot go along.</text>
