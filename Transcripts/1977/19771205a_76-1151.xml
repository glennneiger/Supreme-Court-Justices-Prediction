            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="23.719" offset="174760">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.722" offset="186777">This case presents two important issues concerning the scope of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.253" offset="208928">The facts in the case are not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.895" offset="219482">Briefly respondent Mr. Ceccolini owned and operated a flower shop in Tarrytown, New York where he conducted a gambling business by taking bets on numbers and sporting events from customers and turning over the proceeds to one in man named Francis Millow.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.166" offset="288550">In 1973 the FBI conducted a visual surveillance of respondent's flower shop and concluded that the shop was being used as a drop spot or pick up spot for a numerous operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.881" offset="339436">In December 1973 however the FBI surveillance was discontinued, a year later in December 1974 a local policeman officer Ronald Biro, took a break from his school patrol duties and went in to the shop for a cigarette break and went behind the counter and sat down and struck up a conversation with Lois Hennessey, a sales women who had been employed in the shop for about a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.711" offset="458764">Respondent was not in the shop at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.668" offset="470571">While officer Biro was sitting down, taking a break and talking to Miss Hennessey, he noticed on top of the cash register an envelope, an unsealed envelope, it had some money sticking out it and apparently for no other reason than curiosity, he looked in the envelope and saw in the envelope money and what appeared to him to be gambling slips.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.284" offset="557088">And he put the envelope back, he closed the envelope and put it back on top of the cash register.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.713" offset="578822">Office Biro did not tell Miss Hennessey what he had seen in the envelope and she testified later that she did not know what was in the envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.921" offset="619573">He did however ask Miss Hennessey, who the envelope was for and she told that the respondent had given it to her to give to somebody later that day, but she did not say who and he did not ask her.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.379" offset="677461">Officer Biro was unaware at that time that the respondent had been under investigation for gambling activities but the next day he did tell his fellow officers at the local police station what he had seen in this shop and they in turn informed one of the FBI agents who had conducted the earlier surveillance that officer Biro had seen some gambling slips in this shop and that apparently Miss Hennessey appeared to know something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.653" offset="778502">Four months later in April, 1975, the FBI agent interviewed Miss Hennessey at her home and the record is quite clear that she freely and willingly undertook to disclose to the FBI agent, her considerable knowledge about respondent’s gambling activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.015" offset="1419965">In May of 1970, four months later, the respondent was subpoena to appear before the grand jury and he unequivocally denied under oath that he had ever taken gambling bets from his customers either for himself or for Mr. Millow or that he ever had discussed gambling operations for Mr. Millow.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.557" offset="1490182">Respondent was then indicted for purgery before the grand jury and he waived his right to a jury trial, and he was tried before Judge Gagliardi.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.412" offset="1521634">The government’s principal evidence in this purgery trial was a testimony of Lois Hennessey who testified in some detailed about respondents gambling activities over the year of her employment with Mr. Millow.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.851" offset="1579312">At the end of the trial, Judge Gagliardi entered a finding of guilt on one count of the purgery indictment against Mr. Ceccolini.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.545" offset="1610137">Judge Gagliardi then considered the respondent’s motion to suppress the testimony of Miss Hennessey that respondent had made at the outset of the trial but that judge with respondent’s consent had deferred pending the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.958" offset="1667815">The judge then granted respondent’s suppression motion on the grounds that the testimony of Miss Hennessey was the tainted fruit of officer Biro’s search and he then set aside his finding of guilt on the ground that without her testimony there was insufficient evidence to convict respondent of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.415" offset="1741585">Although the Court granted the government’s petition raising two exclusionary rule issues, respondent’s principal argument is that the government’s appeal in this case was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.926" offset="1787665">We believe that that argument, that the respondent’s Double Jeopardy argument is clearly foreclosed by the decisions of this Court in United States versus Wilson and United States versus Jenkins and United States versus Martin Lennon which hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated unless there is a possibility of a retrial in the general issue of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.715" offset="1866764">And that possibility does not exist in this case; if the government prevails Judge Gagliardi’s finding of guilt may simply be reinstated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.322" offset="5529235">Well thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.782" offset="5551074">The first issue that our petition raises is whether the exclusionary rule requires expression of evidence in connection with crimes committed after the evidence is obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.443" offset="5597676">That issue is simply illustrated by the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.060" offset="5612200">Officer Biro’s excessive curiosity disclosed information about gambling activities incriminating to Mr. Ceccolini, that information was of two types.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.613" offset="5650339">First it was tangible evidence of gambling activities, and second it was information that Miss Hennessey appeared to know something about it. Now there is no question in this case that the information, at least the tangible evidence that officer Biro discovered could not be admitted in any prosecution of the respondent for crimes committed before that search took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.495" offset="5737901">Either gambling offenses or other crimes, the only question in this case is whether the exclusionary rule requires the information that he discovered to be suppressed in the prosecution of purgery that took place 5 months after his search took place and our position is very simple that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.341" offset="5821284">The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct by taking away their incentives and it is very difficult to see how policemen would have much incentive to search for evidence of a crime that has not yet taken place and may never take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.534" offset="5890039">And even if a policeman did have much incentive in that respect it is doubtful that the exclusionary rule would provide much significant deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.656" offset="5926610">If a policeman is not going to be deterred from conducting an unlawful search by the prospect of jeopardizing the prosecution of a crime that is already been committed, it seems very unlikely that the prospect of suppressing evidence of a future crime would make him behave any differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.066" offset="6000171">And in any event, it is clear from the facts of this case we submit that officer Biro was not at all motivated by desire to find evidence of a crime that had not yet taken place or evidence upon his purgery 5 months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.112" offset="6052416">Officer Biro testified and there is no dispute that he was not even aware at that time the respondent was engaged in a gambling activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.877" offset="6083449">Well we think the Court of Appeals erred in applying the exclusionary rule to the subsequently committed crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.290" offset="6105079">The issue does not appear to arise and is not very frequently, where we have only three other cases discussed in our brief, in which the issue is arisen and in all of those decisions, the courts held evidence was admissible The issue that arises far more frequently is a second issue presented in this case which is whether the trial testimony of Lois Hennessey should be considered to be the tainted fruit of officer Biro's search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.186" offset="6224719">This court is expressly reserved the live witness testimony question in previous decisions and there has been considerable difference in the opinion among the Court of Appeals on the matter. That issue is separate and independent from the first subsequent crime issue, and if our position is sustained it would want a reversal to this case whatever the court decided on the subsequent crime issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.227" offset="6320850">In this case it appears as a result of the search of the envelope officer Biro learned that Hennessey might know something about respondent’s gambling activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.562" offset="6358153">He did not find that out for certain and he did not know what if anything she knew about it, but a follow up interview four months later disclosed that she had considerable knowledge about the matter and was perfectly willing to cooperate and testify about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.122" offset="6420429">The question very simply is whether her testimony, a trial about those matters is excludable as the fruit of officer Biro's search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.661" offset="6462538">Ever since Nardone versus United States, it has been accepted that at some point along the causal chain of evidence originating from some illegality, the connection between the evidence developed and the original illegality becomes so attenuated as to dissipate the original taint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.148" offset="6552504">The attenuation doctrine is simply an application of the basic theory of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.533" offset="6582075">At some point an item of evidence derived only remotely from the original illegality the exclusion of that evidence is not going to significantly deter a policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.795" offset="6623139">So the question in each case is where in that causal chain the attenuation point occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.051" offset="6652187">Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Nardone suggested that question be left to the good sense of judges but in close cases judges have equally good sense frequently disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.069" offset="6688236">So this court has established a number of guidelines to guide Federal judges in that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.232" offset="6716866">With respect to the question of verbal statements made after an arrest for example, this court in Wong Sun versus United States and Brown versus Illinois defined the inquiry as whether the statement is sufficiently a product of free will as to break the causal chain between that statement and the original illegality and is defined as relevant to that inquiry, a number of factors including the temporary proximity between the arrest and the illegality, the presence of intervening circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.149" offset="6872556">The degree to which the police exploited the original illegality and finally the flagrancy of that illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.879" offset="6907456">The trouble is that those considerations just do not apply very well in case of considering -- in considering whether the testimony of a witness should be deemed to be the fruit of an original illegality or if they did apply they would indicate, they would lead to the conclusion in almost every case we submit that the testimony ought to be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.558" offset="7010169">Whether the testimony of a witness like Lois Hennessey is more approximately the result of officer Biro’s search or is more approximately the result of intervening acts of free will by herself or by the FBI agent who decided to interview her or by the prosecutor who decided to subpoena her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.384" offset="7089477">Those are basically philosophical questions that are un-resolveable and that have very little to do with the purpose of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.802" offset="7123123">They do not have much to do with the purpose of the exclusionary rule because essentially they focus on the witness’s state of mind and the circumstances occurring after the police search took place, the policeman's conduct took place, rather then on those things that might have motivated the police to engage in that conduct in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.673" offset="7206610">Furthermore and in almost every case the decision of a witness to testify is based on a very large complex of motivations and circumstance and an analysis that requires the court to try to figure out the role that free will plays in that decision permits court to come to almost any conclusion that they desire in any given case, as we thank the opinions of Court of Appeals in this area indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.888" offset="7319459">Those reasons we think the live witness question ought to be decided as a policy matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.689" offset="7334715">A policy matter that looks to the purpose of the exclusionary rule and very simply, a question which inquires whether the exclusion of a witness’s trial testimony is likely to provide enough additional deterrents of police misconduct outweigh the social cost of exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.719" offset="7410783">And while there is not much empirical data on the matter, there really is in not in exclusionary rule cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.395" offset="7433562">We think it is reasonable to conclude that the police have significantly less incentive to engage in unconstitutional conduct, to discover the name of a possibly potential witness than to obtain tangible evidence or verbal fruits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2570.154" offset="10360530">I think that if the government does this, goes to this delay in order to give itself a technical right of appeal and I think that if the district court judge goes along with this then you have inequitable conduct which should in my judgment stop the federal government from exercising its technical right of appeal but what is even more important is that there was a motion made to dismiss at the close of the prosecutions case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.094" offset="10464288">At that point Judge Gagliardi in my judgment, was under an obligation to determine what evidence licitly was before him, if he was going to determine then that the only listed the evidence before him was insufficient to convict the defendant, then he should have it that time entered a judgment of acquittal, at that time jeopardy would have attached, at that time the government would have no right of appeal by merely through a nicety or technicality reserving this right, reserving it until after he has heard all of the evidence, reserving until he has weighed illegal evidence in determining a verdict of guilty, then determine to set it aside simply because.</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.794" offset="10919132">Now, I don’t believe that the government should take advantage of its own wrong doing, this court has many times said that a wrong doer should not profit by its wrong doing and this case it is the government who was the wrong doer and in this case it is the government that seeks the profit by its wrong doing and it will if this court will permit it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2737.328" offset="11029265">In other words, should an individual who finds himself in a position of knowing that the government has illegally obtained evidence, should he be with impunity able to fly in the face of that that evidence and commit subsequent crimes, I believe not and I do not intend to argue that point; what I would argue is simply this and I think all of the cases that have been considered have held this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.444" offset="11117663">That where a defendant has no knowledge of the illegality and then he goes before a grand jury and then the prosecutor does not tell him that he is a target and then the prosecutor does not tell him that he has any kind of illegal evidence and then this defendant is not placed in the same position as the individual who is aware of the fact there was an illegal search and seizure, then despite that such as in the income tax cases files a fraudulent return or in the other fraud cases commits a fraudulent act relying of course, erroneously, on the fact of that the government can not use that testimony or that illegal evidence in order to convict him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.972" offset="12395782">Now, we turn to a question of double jeopardy, I heard the Solicitor General argue quite strenuously for the fact that you can at any time appeal from any type of an order which -- the effect of which will be if you win the appeal merely to reinstate a guilty verdict and he says that even if the court would make further findings that still that is all right because all you are going to do reinstate a guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.294" offset="12517095">If that would be the rule that this court sets, I would disagree with it wholeheartedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.928" offset="12535694">I would argue and I would ask this court to adopt a rule which says that if the court whether it is this court, the Second Circuit or the lower court whoever is given the task of making further findings is obligated to make factual determinations of any kind and it defends the rule against double jeopardy and I would not permit, if I had the power to allow the court to make further findings, I believe and that the solicitor general is accurate when he says that if all the court has to do without making any further findings of any kind is to reinstate a guilty verdict then of course that the order is appealable or the judgment is appealable without further to do when this court has said so but if It is going to add on or wander away from, melt away the question of do you or should you make further findings then I would strenuously argue that it should not be permitted, no further findings otherwise its double jeopardy I believe that is what the case is saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.078" offset="12812279">I would like just a moment to address something which I do not believe has ever then fully argued before this court if it has been argued at all and that is I believe this court should adopt the Doctrine of Equitable Estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.212" offset="12860762">I believe that the foundation of every exclusionary rule, the foundation of every rule which says evidence can or cannot be admitted and that one can or cannot exercise a privilege or a right is based upon the Doctrine of Clean Hands that the wrong doer should not profit by his wrong doing that one should not walk into court with unclean hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.123" offset="12936412">I believe this court in Harris v. New York which was argued unsuccessfully unfortunately by my former partner and it is a matter of the interest argued successfully by the District Attorney who later became my partner is simply that one who does come into court with unclean hands, that is one who is perjurer, that can not take advantage of that purgery by getting on the stand and perjuring himself a no, that you can use illegal evidence to impeach him, if that be the case I would argue more strenuously that where the government is a wrong doer, where the government makes a mistake where the government does something to create something which it really has no right to then under that set of circumstances the government should be estopped, the government has been estopped in civil cases involving aliens and the tax cases and other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.325" offset="13121255">I believe it to be the foundation of all of your doctrine of exclusionary rules and I would ask this court to adopt it in this case to prevent or estopp the government from exercising any technical right of appeal and saying that from this moment on the government has to act is a civilized human being just as everyone else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.320" offset="14153196">I know its an over simplification but I think you have to make an analysis as to whether or not what happened, in the intervening time superseded what happened before hand so as to be independent and I do not think that is what happened here, I am not saying it can not happen or that you can not get a set of facts in which something like that will arise, I suppose it is a close time element that maybe that would be more persuasive but we do not have this type of analysis in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.764" offset="14391015">18 U.S.C. Section 3731 appears to me to permit a government appeal from a decision granting a suppression motion even after a finding of guilt or a verdict of guilt has been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.096" offset="14448275">The statute says an appeal by the United State shall lie to Court of Appeals from a decision in order of the – from a decision or order of a district court, suppressing or excluding evidence, not made after defendant has been put in jeopardy and before the verdict of finding on an indictment or information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.590" offset="14530300">The language would seem to imply that if the suppression order is made after the verdict or finding of guilt, it may be appealed, if the decision is a made and there is not in the statute any requirement of that decision on a suppression motion being the form of a judgment.</text>
