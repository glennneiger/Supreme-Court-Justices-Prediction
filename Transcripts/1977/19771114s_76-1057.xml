            <text syncTime="11.703" offset="126789">This case was brought here -- this case is brought here on a -- by way of appeal from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.500" offset="169944">A woman by the name of Sallye French died in the district of Columbia just 20 days after executing a will, leaving most of her estate to certain churches in the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.289" offset="225114">A section of the D.C. Code makes void any devise or bequest to a religious institution made within 30 days of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.486" offset="269836">Faced with this provision of the code, the appellee, Michael M. Doyle, asked for instructions in the probate division of the superior court of the district of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.206" offset="324798">Both that court and ultimately the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the law is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.106" offset="360324">The decedent's heirs and next of kin brought an appeal to this Court under a Section of volume 28 of the United States Code that provides for review by appeal in cases "where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of the United States and the decision is against its validity."</text>
            <text syncTime="91.523" offset="446006">We postponed consideration of the question of our appellate jurisdiction until the hearing of the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.776" offset="479025">For the reasons set out in considerable detail in the court's written opinion filed with the clerk today, we have concluded that a law applicable only in the District of Columbia is not a statute of the United States for purposes of the jurisdictional provision in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.652" offset="554571">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.321" offset="573170">Treating the papers as a petition for writ of certiorari as we are required by law to do, we deny the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.295" offset="609114">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion which has been joined by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
