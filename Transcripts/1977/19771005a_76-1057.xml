            <text syncTime="90.089" offset="440255">Very briefly, I would like to mention the statement of the case to this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.641" offset="470452">This case involves a D.C Board, main statute, Section 18-302 and that statute basically provides that a devise or bequest of real or personal property to a minister, priest, rabbi, a public teacher or preacher of the gospel or to such religious order and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.171" offset="548611">He is not valid unless it is made unless it is made within 30 days before the death of the testator.Sallye Lipscomb French executed a will and left religious bequest and did not survive that will for 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.052" offset="640144">Thereafter a complaint for instructions was filed by Judge Doyle and the case was heard before the Superior Court on motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.159" offset="692598">The religious legatees being defendants as well as the heirs at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.641" offset="726452">The lower court found that 18-302 is in fact unconstitutional for both First and Fifth Amendment reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.155" offset="772532">Appeal was taken to the District Court of Appeals, that court found that the statute was unconstitutional for due process or Fifth Amendment reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.412" offset="965525">In inadvertence, Your Honor, it is sort of hidden way down at the bottom of one of the, one of your rules and we just did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.667" offset="1002619">We did a make statement that 1257 (1) is a basis of the jurisdiction but we did not argue and we apologize to the court for not having done so.</text>

            <label>Mr. Floyd Willis, III</label>
            <text syncTime="244.629" offset="1058416">Frankly the significance of that escaped us to and we are now prepared to argue and our argument would be very brief basically based on Palmore, that this court does in fact have appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.157" offset="1136575">Because of 1257 (1) and because of the language in 1257 (1) which states that the -- for purposes of this section and I think the language must include the whole section, paragraphs, one two and three, so that the highest court of the state include District of Columbia, Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.822" offset="1239184">And in Palmore, I believe Your Honors decided basically that since Congress had not said that the appellate right of Mr. Palmore were because the statute was in fact, made the District of Columbia equivalent to a state statute then it must follow in our reasoning that the statute is in fact a statute of United State, and were it not so, I think that the additional language that I earlier cited would have no meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.742" offset="1442939">In addition to that, Your Honors, I feel that there are substantial Federal questions involved here and that our jurisdictional statement could be treated as a petition for writ of Certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.874" offset="1499468">Now with respect to the issues involved in this case, it is submitted that this statute does not infringe on the Establishment Clause over the free exercise clause of First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.990" offset="1631856">At first blush it certainly appears to involve religion, the statute is directed solely at religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.650" offset="1882527">I suppose if there were not a comma after public teacher, he went into -- that your attribute to the statute would be much clearer, public teacher or preacher of the gospel, that comma makes your construction of it a little more difficult or the construction that you tell us that the District of Columbia courts have put on.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.201" offset="1964761">I think those are just consecutive statements of who the statute will applied to Your Honor and I think that is what the comma means.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.375" offset="2033411">Now, it certainly is something that has not occurred to us any of us before this the arguments below taken somewhat by surprised by that and I really probably do not have a good answer to it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Floyd Willis, III</label>
            <text syncTime="519.482" offset="2157858">That is correct that has been the position of both Judge Newman and the DC Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.250" offset="2200908">Now, the Court of Appeals decided this case only on the rationale basis doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.791" offset="2243122">It decided that the statute had no objective of that to extend withstand a statutory scheme that would make it consistent with the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.463" offset="2325773">We submit that the statute just really part of the statutory scheme involving a testamentary transfer of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.272" offset="2357016">A power reserved solely to the Courts and solely to the states and that if the statute involves religion, at all it just does so indirectly, the statute's objective is to prevent the improvident gifts to buy a testator within this very brief period 30 days, since the making of a will and I think it has two- fold and a prophylactic basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.324" offset="2469238">It is to preclude the use of undue influence by religion for a limited period of 30 days</text>

            <text syncTime="666.924" offset="2747598">I submit that surely the effect on religion, if there is any effect at all is less then existed in Brawnfeld wherein huge merchants maintained their day work discriminated against because of their religious beliefs and they were not able to stay in the status of workings on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.169" offset="2848640">The statute is not designed to punish religion in our view, or to limit religious practices or beliefs, nor it is purpose to establish or de-establish religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.548" offset="2890123">It prescribes only for a very brief period testamentary transfers and such prescription is for a legitimate state purpose that is the legitimate fear of government that there is a mischief that can be perpetrated by as Mr. Justice Rehnquist says at least more readily by a person having the ability to express to a testator, the possibility of salvation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.710" offset="6554789">I submit also now that we have already talked about a little bit that there is no reason to apply the strict scrutiny standard, I submit the statute has a clearly secular purpose, that is to protect the testator and the heirs and to prevent a particular class, a defined class from exercising undo influence within a very limited period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.042" offset="6660114">Its primary effect, I think neither advances nor inhibits religion and I emphasize the words 'primary effect' and there is no excessive entanglement with religion in this case, no more so certainly than in the tax case was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.336" offset="6757290">And in that situation as I indicated the primary effect portion of that standard is one that most closely be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.038" offset="6804101">The question becomes in my view, in our view, he is the incidentally impact on religion that is the denial of this bequest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.121" offset="6848405">Here assuming that there is an incidental impact, which results from the non-fundamental interest of a scheme of testamentary disposition obviously one which does not have a fundamental right attached to it; there is some question as to whether or not there is right to testamentary disposition without state procedures in any of event, is that incidental impact sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny, and I submit that in the standard that Your Honors have previously made the 'primary effect' clearly eliminates incidental impact and consequently that there is no compelling state interest that must be shown by the heirs at law or ordinarily by the District of Columbia government but they have declined to become involved in this after the superior court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.141" offset="7120496">Further, I suggest that what the courts below have done is they have substituted their own judgment for what is purely a legislative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.967" offset="7167830">There is a rational basis for the statute, they do not like the statute and as a consequence, they declare the statute to be violative of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.476" offset="7213806">The statute may no longer be as valid as it once was, it is an 1866 statute, the same Congress that passed the Fourteenth Amendment and Judge Pomeroy in a dissent in a case from Pennsylvania, In re estate of Cavill (ph), said that in an age when the hope of salvation may be less vivid and the fear of damnation less acute than formerly it was, one may disagree with the wisdom or necessity of the provision before today but wisdom whether that this of court or the legislature is not determinative of legislative power, thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.294" offset="7413068">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.276" offset="7461029">I would like first to address myself to the jurisdiction question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.311" offset="7489136">The Appellees renew their motion to dismiss this appeal on the ground that the court has no jurisdiction over the appeal under Title 28 USC Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.340" offset="7549323">This motion is based upon the fact that allows any statute of the Congress is a statute of the United States, Congress did not intend laws applicable only in the District of Columbia to be statutes of the United States for purposes of this courts appeal jurisdiction under Section 1257 of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.204" offset="7652767">We rely on the case of the American Security and Trust Company v. the Commissioners and the other case is cited in our motion to dismiss and also in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.188" offset="7712640">In the American Security case the court had under consideration, the provisions or Section 250 of the judicial code enacted in 1911 which provided that any final judgment or decree of the Court of Appeals may be reexamined in cases in which the construction of any law of the United States is drawn in to question by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.960" offset="7831758">The court in the American Security case held that Section 250 of the judicial code should not be applied to purely local laws applicable only in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.355" offset="7885362">The opinion pointed out that the same phrase used in the statute may have different meanings in different connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.136" offset="7924441">In other words it is the context in which Congress uses the phrase that is important and it is we say here that the context in the present situation, it is unreasonable to believe the Congress in cases from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals where a statute is limited or confined to the operation in the District of Columbia are determined to be invalid is not to be -- come to this court by direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.236" offset="8064875">In Palmore v. United States, the court pointed out that jurisdictional statutes are to be strictly construed in authorizing appeals to this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.192" offset="8112732">That case interpreted certain provisions of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.917" offset="8135615">The Court reformed a Criminal Procedure Act of 1917, that act clearly indicated that distinctions between the statutes of the United States and statutes of the District of Columbia are of jurisdictional importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.127" offset="8200398">If the new District of Columbia courts organized under article 1 or to be able to function as purely local courts and United States District Courts for the -- and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia was to be able to function as an exclusively Article III Court by section 1702 (C) of that Act, Congress added section 1363 to Title 28 of the code and that section provides for purposes of this chapter referring to District Court jurisdiction, references to the laws of the United States are acts of Congress do not include laws applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.833" offset="8395272">Congress has recognized not only in the District of Columbia Court Reform Act in 1970, but generally, that enactments for the District of Columbia are separately distinct from those that are applicable to the entire United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.208" offset="8468728">It is done this by enacting two separate codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.302" offset="8485133">The District of Columbia code specifically provides that it contains all the general and permanent laws relating to or enforcing the District of Columbia except such laws as are applicable in the District of Columbia by reason of being laws of the United States, latter laws of course are -- appear in the United States code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.541" offset="8578129">Now in the American Security and Trust Company case, the court recognized that the jurisdictional statute, it was interpreting there was passed to reduce the number of deals to this court; the position which was contended for by the appellant in that case would have had the effect of increasing the number of appeals contrary to the intention of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2939.255" offset="11836957">The Court of Appeals relies on the legislative history and stated that the purpose of the Statute was to preclude bequest, gifts to clergymen and to religious organizations by persons who might be unduly influenced by religious considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.787" offset="11919086">It pointed out that the Statute voids only bequest and devises for the benefit of religious institutions or the clergy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.097" offset="11952314">Testamentary bequest to charitable organizations are not included in the DC Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.256" offset="11976973">Further the Statute is interpreted by the District of Columbia Courts and I believe this Court will power the interpretations of the District of Columbia Court distinguishes between bequest to religious institutions and bequest to charitable institutions owned and operated by religious institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.834" offset="12059207">The Statute only validates bequest to religious organizations and for the religious purposes and to the clergy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.349" offset="12097345">The Court concluded that there was no rational basis for presuming that a testator troubled by religious convictions is likely to make a bequest directly to a church rather than to a charity run by the church, the Statute thus treats similarly situated legatees entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.389" offset="12193476">They further pointed out that there were others, such as lawyers, doctors, nurses and charities who are in an equal position with to influence a testator, yet the Statute never covers them and the same lean out of religion where there is no grounds or difference is irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.834" offset="12283233">As I stated before this Statute operates if the testator has no family or heirs and this if it does had no family heirs, the bequest is automatically void and escheats to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.962" offset="12375811">It was stated that the Courts of the District of Columbia had used the doctrine of dependent relative revocation in other cases to avoid the Statute and this is true, and it was pointed out that it was not used in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.077" offset="12504229">The reason was not used in this case, and we never got to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.347" offset="12901290">It is argued that it is a part of the law of District relating to testamentary dispositions, the appellees recognized that a state can legislate to regulate both testate and intestate succession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.698" offset="12962730">However when the State does so legislate, it can not do so in a discriminatory matter and it is here, its laws must be consistent with the requirements of equal protection and the Statute here singles out gifts to religious institutions for religious purposes and to the clergy in a discriminatory matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.110" offset="13072340">The Appellant state that the Statute does not regulate a fundamental interest protected by the First Amendment and therefore that there is no need to show a compelling interest to justify the Statute.</text>
