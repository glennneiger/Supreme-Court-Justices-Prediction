          <turn speaker="chester_m_howe" startTime="130.866" stopTime="557.997">
            <label>Mr. Chester M. Howe</label>
            <text syncTime="130.866" offset="603395">I would agree with that Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.344" offset="621368">The Congressional Authorization appears in Section 1464 (h) and it provides in pertinent part, that no state shall impose any tax on Federal associations or their franchise, capital reserves, surplus or loans or income greater than that imposed on similar Local Mutual or Cooperative Thrift and Home Financing institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.549" offset="730142">This is a case of first impression which should determine extent to which Congress has authorized state taxation of federal associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.834" offset="775281">In 1966, Massachusetts elected to tax federal associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.690" offset="798687">The tax as imposed was measured by a deposit element and by an income element.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.395" offset="825541">The statute is now challenged on the grounds that it conflicts with 1464 (h) because it discriminates against federal associations and also because it violates federal constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.763" offset="879039">I propose to address four issues presented in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.920" offset="899624">The first is that the state statute exempts entirely all Massachusetts Credit Unions from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.966" offset="935777">The exemption is discriminatory if State Credit Unions are similar to federal associations within the meaning of 1464 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="224.862" offset="979454">The largest Credit Unions in Massachusetts are functionally similar, though not identical in both powers and purposes and in operations to federal associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.801" offset="1027206">The next two issues, which I would like to address, is whether the tax is a franchise tax or whether the commerce clause is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.072" offset="1064195">Both arise from one statutory defect and that is, that the statute has no apportionment provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.380" offset="1093453">As a result, all income earned outside the Massachusetts by federal associations, is taxed by Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.650" offset="1130546">Federal associations have earned during years that we have statistics about a third of their income from states other than Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.353" offset="1169417">The associations are a part of a National Housing Program and necessarily do a large out-of-state business.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.197" offset="1204734">Other states provide a variety of benefits upon federal associations to their recording facilities in other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.050" offset="1240156">The statute makes no attempt to exclude from the tax base, the benefits conferred by the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.165" offset="1268577">By definition of franchise tax measures only, the value of the benefits conferred by the taxing state, Massachusetts goes beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.999" offset="1311941">It fails to limit is tax based in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.920" offset="1331585">The commerce cause parallels to franchise tax issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.489" offset="1349870">Again, no apportionment is provided where income earned outside the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.573" offset="1374217">The risk here is one of double taxation on the federal associations, which ought to be prohibited by the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.869" offset="1415386">The final and perhaps most important issue is that the State Court found that the income measure of the tax discriminates against federal associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.172" offset="1456659">The discrimination is caused by the deduction from income for required additions to surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.128" offset="1488424">All Thrift institutions have that kind of requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.985" offset="1507859">The terminology may vary from institution to institution, but they are called guarantee fund surplus or something equivalent to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.483" offset="1545893">The State Court finding discrimination is clearly accurate, it should be dispositive of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.073" offset="1572225">However, the State Court excused the discrimination on the grounds that its source was a Federal Regulatory Agency, which regulates the amount of the reserve requirements for federal associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.714" offset="1626768">The court also said that the associations have failed to show a substantial competitive disadvantage, neither justification is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.180" offset="1676715">This case arises as a result of a declaratory judgment by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.141" offset="1712555">The record consists of a stipulated facts and an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.520" offset="1734079">The Court upheld the state’s statute against all challenges presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.585" offset="1754246">It was the second time that the state statute had been before court.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.633" offset="1774517">In 1973, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, held the deposit elements of the tax to be invalid as against the federal associations on the grounds that it was discriminatory against them on the 1464 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="438.784" offset="1835121">The basis of the holding was that in general the mortgage deduction loans, which were a deduction from the deposits element, were applicable solely to them state institutions. Out-of-state loans were not deductible and the greatest impact of that limitation was against the federal associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.980" offset="1923833">The court, the Court of Appeals that is, abstained from the adjudicating the income element of the tax on the grounds of comity, indicating that there was an adequate remedy in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.605" offset="1974406">Beginning with the Credit Union Issue, the State Court found that Credit Unions are in fact, mutual thrift and home financing institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.401" offset="2013590">However, it concluded that they were not similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.402" offset="2029577">The Court said that and I quote, “The test for similarity is not what each type of institution might do, but rather what each type of institution does not in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.954" offset="2087777">The associations urge the standard adopted as erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.627" offset="2102510">The test is otherwise in other cases, other tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.404" offset="2121528">Since 1935, this Court’s leading decision in Morrisey v. Commissioner, the character of an institution has been determined by its powers, not by what is does not in fact, but by what it might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.329" offset="2185266">The basis of the holding is an institution may exercise the powers granted to it fully at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.016" offset="2215986">In the National Bank taxing cases, involving a statute related 1464 (h), the test is also based upon powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.016" offset="2259977">For example, in Mercantile Bank v. New York case, the sole emphasis for testing similarity between New York Trust Companies and National Banks was the respective powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.647" offset="2398530">Would that require them to repeal the tax on the federal or is there a requirement that all similar institutions be taxed?</text>

            <text syncTime="872.070" offset="3568189">The state court, in fact did note, that there were statutory differences and commented that the primary area was in the details of the loans that might be made and in the lending powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.885" offset="3611448">Beyond that, it made no judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.415" offset="3629629">For the larger Credit Unions, the percentage of mortgage loans may, it begins to approximate the percentage of the loans made by federal associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.580" offset="3670275">There were 99 Credit Unions with over $2 million in assets each in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.112" offset="3696398">The $2 million figure is important because the powers of Credit Unions are scaled according to their size.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.496" offset="3721893">At the $2 millions level, the powers that I have been addressing are with Credit Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.906" offset="3747598">Below that, the loan provisions are lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.076" offset="3772257">Of the 99, that group invested $330 million in of their assets in mortgage loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.220" offset="3812799">The 20 of that group had more that 50% and 10th of that group had over 60% of their assets in mortgage loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.844" offset="3851356">The major difference which exists between the two kinds entities is that the federal associations invest almost exclusively in mortgage loans, whereas Credit Unions do a substantial personal loans business.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.775" offset="3911020">They invested approximately 43% of their assets in personal loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.209" offset="3932754">Nevertheless, other concededly similar institutions, invest substantial portions of their assets in non-real estate loans and by way of example, the State Saving Banks in 1972, invested over 35% of their assets in corporate securities, a power which the federal associations do not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.759" offset="4018958">State Savings Banks are conceded to be similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.897" offset="4039542">In considering this question of similarity, it should be remembered that differences must exist if similarity can exist between entities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.069" offset="4096280">Without differences, there would be identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.311" offset="4105162">If we do not have differences, we would either have only Credit Unions or only federal savings and loan associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.459" offset="4133792">The State Courts which have considered this issue in the past, have failed to recognize that simple proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.481" offset="4165870">They have universally permitted, very minimal differences to be the basis for the exemption of Credit Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.892" offset="4219474">Unlike the State Court, the tax commission emphasizes differences in lending powers to support finding of dissimilarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.575" offset="4258239">To properly assess this contention, it should be remembered that the Congress intended to protect federal associations from discriminatory tax treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.254" offset="4300976">If a state institution has powers greater than those of the federal associations, the local institution has an advantage, an economic advantage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.914" offset="4391568">In substance, the Tax Commission would have the court believe that the Credit Union with over $65 million in assets, with larger investment powers, needs special protection by way of tax exemption, stating the proposition demonstrates its invalidity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.520" offset="4482057">Both the State Tax Commission and the State Court also assert that the preference for personal loans imposed on Credit Unions, limitation was significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.904" offset="4531585">In fact, it really adds the power to Credit Unions that federal associations do not have and in an any event, it is not restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.546" offset="4570142">Any Credit Union, which invests in accordance with its statutory powers that is for example up to 80% on mortgage loans, cannot validly be criticized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.629" offset="4614445">The commission cites no case or regulatory proceeding to show that the statutory precatory language regarding personal loans has ever been enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.603" offset="5834364">If there is proof that, that proposition is incorrect, it has not come forth and that burden rests on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.212" offset="5896848">Regarding the legislative history, the State Commission relied heavily on the fact that the federal taxing policy towards Federal and State Credit Unions, supports their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.195" offset="5948780">We believe that the reliance is misplaced and the reason is that the federal legislation began in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.932" offset="5983679">At that time, the Federal Credit Union was empowered to make loans with a maturity of not over 2 years and the maximum loan that a Credit Union could issue was $200.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.217" offset="6032790">In 1951, which is when Savings and Loans Associations became taxable under Title XXVI, the Internal Revenue Code, the maximum maturity for loans for Federal Credit Union is only 3 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.061" offset="6104156">The differences in powers and purposes of the Federal Credit Unions and Federal Savings and Loan Associations clearly justified the Federal difference in treatment in taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.711" offset="6146788">Federal Credit Unions continue to be exempt from tax for Federal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.778" offset="6167059">States, however, have been empowered to tax Federal Credit Unions from the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.405" offset="6193599">If taxed, however, they had to be taxed at a rate not greater than that imposed on Local Banking Institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.981" offset="6227872">The fact that Congress linked, Federal Credit Unions with Banking Institutions establishes that the Federal Credit Unions were considered to be light Banking Institutions and not some unique kind of entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.057" offset="6292133">The Massachusetts tax policy, on the other hand, began in 1966, 32 years after Federal Credit Unions were first created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.372" offset="6361410">In doing so, it was obligated in 1966 to make the comparison between Federal Associations and Credit Unions to see whether at that time, they were similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.932" offset="6407699">There is no point in comparing Credit Unions as they existed in 1934 and Federal Associations as they existed in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.009" offset="6455973">Moreover, our view is 1464 ought to be read to impose a continuing obligation on states to maintain a nondiscriminatory tax on Federal Associations, that is the whole function of 1464 when compared to all similar institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.354" offset="6525355">If a local entity is to have its tax exemption continue, the exemption must be re-examined each time, there is a substantive change in the powers of either, Federal Associations or the Local Entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.396" offset="6585541">It is not something that can be once looked at and then forgotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.966" offset="6603826">An exemption from tax not discriminatory in its origins, may become so over time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.157" offset="6920535">Perhaps the most important aspect of the statutory history is what President Carter has asked the Congress to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.262" offset="6960973">The President has said in his message to the Congress on January 21 of this year and I quote, “Credit Unions are tax exempt,” yet their powers and functions are defined so broadly that the term Credit Union can include financial institutions that are functionally identical to a Savings and Loan Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.926" offset="7047699">The tax exemption provides them with an unfair advantage over their competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.390" offset="7069537">That is precisely what we have been saying since 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.876" offset="7091480">The federal statutory and legislative history rather than supporting the State Tax Commission, clearly establishes Credit Unions to be similar banking institutions nearly identical to Federal Savings and Loans Associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.380" offset="7157518">There is no justification for the exemption of the tax of the Credit Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.615" offset="7194403">The next two subjects can be handled together and briefly I hope, and they arise because the state statute provides for no apportionment for income earned outside the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.562" offset="7246230">The failure to apportion is fatal in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.388" offset="7265456">The two simple propositions are presented here and the first is definitional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.241" offset="7284891">The State Court labeled the tax a franchise tax and of course, 1464 (h) permits a franchised tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.345" offset="7317283">The real question is, is it a franchise tax within the meaning of 1464 (h) and the answers seems to me is a clear “no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.375" offset="7353436">By definition, a franchise tax must measure only the value of the privileges conferred by the taxing state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.104" offset="7388336">Here in Massachusetts taxes the entire value of the Federal franchise without regard to the benefits conferred by other states and the other states do confer substantial benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.200" offset="7728764">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.175" offset="7740675">I wish to argue three points on behalf of the Commonwealth this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.892" offset="7759484">First and primarily as it turns out that Credit Unions are not similar to the appellant associations either as the word similar was intended by Congress in 12 U.S.C. Section 1464 (h) or under the current facts as presented in the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.114" offset="7848404">My second argument will be that the Massachusetts tax is neutral and fair and nondiscriminatory under the standards of 12 U.S.C. 1464 (h) and finally and briefly that the tax does not intrude upon interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.156" offset="7920607">For the purposes of the whole argument, I wish to emphasize these elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.635" offset="7938475">Massachusetts is attempting to do with this tax is to have the appellant associations, domiciliary corporations contribute their fair share to support the cost of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.869" offset="7991451">The Acts of Congress which authorized state taxation of federal institution such as this in National Banks, plainly support that state tax policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.408" offset="8045577">Additionally, the appellants have presented no independent substantive federal policy which is violated on supremacy class grounds by the state tax in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.405" offset="8101583">Given the fact that Congress in this Court have accorded state tax policy making broad discretion, we believe that the appellant associations have come to this appeal with a heavy burden of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.610" offset="8170442">I am going to turn initially to the tax treatment of Credit Unions which the appellants have emphasized in their oral argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.231" offset="8212865">The appellants say that by treating Credit Unions differently, Massachusetts has violated Federal Law because in their view, Credit Unions are similar to Federal Savings and Loan Associations as the word similar is used in Section 1464 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.915" offset="8279634">This is not he case, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.069" offset="8288202">Credit Unions are not included in state tax, that is true, but they are not similar either as a matter of Congressional intent, the primary standard for this Court or as a matter of current actual fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.109" offset="8344417">Appellant made no argument about Congressional intent at all in the brief they presented to this Court and they could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.685" offset="8374719">The legislative history to the Home Owners Loan Act and it was the Home Owners' Loan Act that established Savings and Loan Associations and also enacted 1464 (h), the Federal Statue in question, that Federal Home Owners Loan Act in the legislative history to it, presented in our brief makes plain that the 73rd Congress did not intend Credit Unions to come within the definition of the word similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.722" offset="8486837">What the Congress had in mind were State Savings and Loan Associations, State Saving Banks and State Cooperative Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.530" offset="8518079">It is interesting to know that the very same Congress, which enacted the Home Owners Loan Act, was the Congress that enacted the Federal Credit Union Act, creating Federal Credit Unions for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.210" offset="8568757">The Federal Credit Union Act was enacted one year later in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.098" offset="8588297">The Congress which had created Savings and Loan Associations, one year later in a establishing Federal Credit Unions, established a wholly different, wholly separate regulatory structure for Federal Credit Unions, which differ significantly from the Federal Home Loan Bank or in Federal Savings and Loan Association, not assigning its view that similarity as what its view of Credit Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.721" offset="8698847">Finally, in terms of Congressional intent, what Massachusetts has done, tax the franchise of Savings and Loan Associations and while not taxing the franchise of Credit Unions, follows almost exactly the tax policy that Congress itself has chosen for purposes of Federal Income Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.464" offset="8785782">Congress has always exempted all Credit Unions, state and federal, from the federal income-base tax, but has since 1951, imposed a Federal Corporate Income Tax on Federal Savings and Loan Associations, including appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.949" offset="8859761">It would be an anomalous to say that the state is precluded from the adopting the same kind of taxing policy in terms of supporting its cost that Congress itself has chosen in imposing the Federal Income Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.040" offset="8920156">One additional point, my brother suggested that Federal Credit Unions were subjected to taxation by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.361" offset="8973446">In fact, I believe that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.783" offset="8983059">The citation is 12 U.S.C. Section 1768 and suggested, the language is that Federal Credit Unions, their property, etc.'shall be exempt from all taxation now or here after imposed by the United States or by any state, territorial, a local taxing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.922" offset="9075637">It appears clear to us that the Congress used Credit Unions, Federal and State as different and subject to different forms of taxation than Federal Savings and Loan Associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.812" offset="9135196">Turning now to the record in this case and the actual facts putting aside for the moment Congressional intent, we believe that appellants have not shown similarity in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.235" offset="9176888">In addressing similarity, we believe it is a comparison between classes of institutions that should be paramount rather than picking a single institution from one class and seeing whether it may bear some similarity to a single institution from another class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.046" offset="9240104">In looking at the classes of institution in question, the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.452" offset="9261733">Credit Unions are very small.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.708" offset="9486804">As far as the remaining 40% of the Credit Unions are concerned, appellants have not shown that their loans are at all competitive with the Federal Associations much larger and far more pervasive real estate lending activity and they could not show competition because the Credit Union Loans are, once again, limited to their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.157" offset="9576561">Credit Union simply cannot go out on a general market and seek to compete with other institutions, who lack the kind of limits that Credit Unions have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.623" offset="9618462">The facts, in short, are against the arguments that appellant are making and they do not support excusing appellants all together from state tax as they would have this Court do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.192" offset="9684708">At bottom, the argument here that the appellants present is one on tax policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.472" offset="9705815">The fact is, as appellants have suggested with quoting a statement from President Carter, it is a policy debate that is now going on between the legislative and executive branches and Massachusetts believes that this Court should resist an attempt to draw the judiciary into the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.428" offset="9801632">I would like to set an out turn just briefly because appellant has not raised this issue in their oral argument to the question of discrimination between Federal Associations on the one hand and the state's treatment of those state entities which they do tax under Section 1464 (h), these are State Saving Banks and State Cooperative Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.674" offset="9902674">The question is whether Massachusetts has unfairly favored local savings institutions somehow at the expense of the Federal Associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.948" offset="9939768">The vital facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.375" offset="9953456">The statute, Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 63 Section 11, is neutral on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.349" offset="9985325">The rate of the tax is the same for the federal and state institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.407" offset="10001626">The types of deductions are identical and the appellants offer nothing apart from the face of the statute to suggest that it was past enacted as a hostile or unfriendly act towards the federal institution and these are the words that this Court has used in assessing the question of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.912" offset="10083650">As far as the appellant’s factual proof goes, they have made no showing of discrimination or disproportion in result between in taxing of federal state and institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.434" offset="10145717">Chiefly, they have made no showing that their actual tax burden in dollars and cents is any heavier proportionally than the tax burden of state institutions and under the decisions of this Court, the failure to show a difference in practical impact on account of the state tax is fatal to their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.357" offset="10237355">The appellants, while they do not present evidence of actual tax impact do present some evidence about the amount of their deductions under the state tax as compared with their total assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.484" offset="10289913">They present ratios comparing the amount of their deductions with total assets and compare that ratio to the ratio for state institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.161" offset="10324604">That ratio has no proximate relationship to actual tax burden about which the record is silent, but even looking at the ratios which are presented, there is no clear pattern this favoring the federal institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.392" offset="10393567">What those ratios of federal and state institution show is that in some years, the state’s institutions did enjoy a proportionally or comparatively a greater deduction than the federal institutions, but in other years, the reverse is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.983" offset="10459918">In three of the years presented by the appellants it was the federal institutions which enjoyed a greater benefit from the deduction, using the ratio evidence that they present and rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.006" offset="10527941">Finally, on this question of discrimination, this Court’s decisions under Section 1464 (h) and the companion provision permitting state tax on National Banks 12 U.S.C. 548, this Court’s decisions under both of those Sections leave no doubt in our view that the state tax is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.959" offset="10619787">Those decisions require fairness and even handedness from the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.012" offset="10639954">Appellants have shied away from these principles and instead their argument demands rigid, mathematical equality between state and federal institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.895" offset="10683526">Following their analysis, no deduction which had a disparate result or even the potential for a disparate result, no matter how small could stand under the principle of discrimination which they advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.689" offset="10746742">In our view, following this Court’s more practical standard of fairness, the appellants claim of discrimination falls short.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.562" offset="10794181">Finally, I would like to turn to the question of whether or not the state tax intrudes impermissibly on interstate commerce under the principles lay down by this Court under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.184" offset="10860741">We believe that on this issue, appellants do not law or evidence on their side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.738" offset="10882893">There is no direct evidence whatsoever of the extent of income that the appellants derive from interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.393" offset="10913508">The record is bare on how many borrowers, real estate mortgage borrowers, live out of state and there is no evidence on how many these loans were culminated out of state, however, we do know this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.806" offset="10975157">We do know that everyone of appellants have all their offices in Massachusetts, and therefore, all of the processing of the loans, all the monitoring of the loans and all the receiving of the loans, goes on in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.380" offset="11053524">Well, we believe the record thus establishes two independent bases, under the commerce clause principles for the tax that Massachusetts has imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.596" offset="11090305">The first relies on the fact that Massachusetts is the state of domicile for the Appellant Associations and under this Court’s decision, a strong presumption exists in favor of a state’s right to demand a support in contribution in the costs of government, when that demand is made by the home state of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.449" offset="11185704">Then second, quite apart from domicile, putting domicile aside, the record shows in this case a close connection between the taxing State Massachusetts and the activities and income upon which the Massachusetts tax has levied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.409" offset="11257593">As a final point under commerce clause, appellants raise the specter of multiple taxation, but they simply have no foundation in our view for arguing that interstate commerce is in jeopardy of multiple taxation and the burden that would flow there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.343" offset="11329377">There is no overlapping tax that exists right now and it would be a strange, we believe, to strike down this current justified tax on the basis that in the future, some state with a lesser claim and a lesser right might impose some tax burden or might stake a claim to a tax burden on some portion of appellant’s income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.981" offset="11435853">In our view, this is a “thin ice” for a constitutional challenge to a state tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.131" offset="11464483">We believe, therefore, and for this reason and other reasons are presented, the reasons the Commonwealth has presented in its brief that the state tax should stand and the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.016" offset="11524042">Thank you very much.</text>
