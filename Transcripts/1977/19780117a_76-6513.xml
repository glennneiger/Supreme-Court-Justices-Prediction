            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79974">We will hear arguments next in Bell against Ohio, 6513.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.413" offset="297626">Mr. Hoefle you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="h_fred_hoefle" startTime="57.246" stopTime="448.004">
            <label>Mr. H. Fred Hoefle</label>
            <text syncTime="57.246" offset="308911">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.047" offset="320092">Before commencing with the more formal part of the argument, I think it would be helpful to delineate the issues briefly and to go into the Ohio statute, both as the legislative history has developed it and as it is operational at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.974" offset="387801">The basic issues that we see in the challenge of the constitutionality of the statute, are, first is the Ohio statute place unconstitutional limitations upon the meaningful consideration of mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.481" offset="445897">Secondly, whether the Ohio capital mitigation set forth in the statute, so narrowly -- is so narrowly circumscribed by the statutes and further by the judicial clause put on it by the Ohio Supreme Court that it precludes consideration of these important factors, and therefore, is virtually a mandatory, and therefore, unconstitutional capital system.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.849" offset="539311">Finally does the Ohio statute permit a sentence or even require a death sentence which is grossly disproportionate to such as to violate the constitution and we claim that the answer to those issues are affirmative in all three instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.138" offset="616425">The Ohio capital statute presently in affect had its genesis before the decision of this Court in Furman as part of an overhaul of all of Ohio's criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.504" offset="673894">When it was first introduced and passed by the Ohio House, it was a model of constitutionality as we have come to see from the Gregg cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.412" offset="713600">It had open ended, broad mitigating factors included.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.082" offset="732199">It had jury participation in the sentencing process guaranteed.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.332" offset="753202">It had a broad roster of aggravating circumstances and the statutes provided for a bifurcated proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.932" offset="791654">While that bill had passed the house and was presently or was at time in the Senate of Ohio, this Court decided the Furman case and the Ohio Senate felt required by Furman, due to its own legislative service committee's recommendations which are cited in the Amicus Brief that to permit discretion even though there were specific mitigating factors enumerated to permit any discretion might be to resolve in the statutes being declared unconstitutional under Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.145" offset="940552">So the final bill as it was passed, retained the bifurcated proceedings, retained all of the, I believe eight aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.669" offset="990603">The mitigating circumstances which were open ended were illuminated eliminated and, but three narrow mitigating circumstances were put into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.233" offset="1028846">Also omitted from the final version was jury participation in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.566" offset="1070224">We feel that the Ohio Legislature has did the legislatures in Louisiana and North Carolina, misconstrued from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.452" offset="1117767">They felt I think that Furman was -- stood for the position that any discretion in the part of sentencing would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.771" offset="1175027">In the present statutes, two statutes within the same group, specifically remove discretion from the Trial Court in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.424" offset="1237616">2929.03(E) which we have cited on page 5 of our brief, indicates that if the Court finds that none of the mitigating circumstances listed in Division B of 2929.04, the revise code, is established by preponderance of the evidence, it shall impose sentence of death on the offender, otherwise it shall impose sentence of life imprisonment on the offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.986" offset="1343883">Now, it is fairly clear in itself, but they go on, on page 6 of our brief it is cited, they repeat this and this is 2929.04(B) down at the bottom of the page where the three mitigating circumstances which we will discuss in a moment are listed.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.839" offset="1415249">Again, it states that death penalty is precluded when considering the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history character or condition of the offender, one or more of the following is established by a preponderance of the evidence is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.797" offset="1467076">So the sentencing really has no discretion at all under the Ohio statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.884" offset="1487452">If the facts are -- as found to constitute a mitigating circumstance, then the offender will live.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.568" offset="1518172">If the facts do not constitute one of the three statutory mitigating factors, he will die. So there is no sentencing discretion whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.289" offset="1573029">Even more significant change that the Ohio Senate made in the statute in response to Furman was the narrowing of the mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.389" offset="1621512">The broad open ended mitigating factor was eliminated, but three remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.657" offset="1646590">I would distinguish that from I believe eight in Florida and the open ended statutes in the Texas and Georgia statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.109" offset="1684310">The most important of the mitigating circumstances because it is the only mitigating circumstance that has anything at all to do with the personality and the individual offender is the third and that provides that the death penalty is precluded if the offense was primarily the product of the offender's psychosis or mental deficiency, though such condition is insufficient to establish the defense of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.925" offset="1803638">Psychosis has been defined as a major severe form of mental disorder or disease that is Random House Dictionary's definition and Webster as the aggitive profound mental disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.629" offset="1862465">So, either a person who is --</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="448.004" stopTime="452.850">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="448.004" offset="1871974">How does that compare with the American Psychiatric Association definition?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_fred_hoefle" startTime="452.850" stopTime="562.470">
            <label>Mr. H. Fred Hoefle</label>
            <text syncTime="452.850" offset="1891305">On psychosis, I believe it is close Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.030" offset="1900082">I frankly have not seen the American Psychiatric definition of psychosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.328" offset="1917218">I believe that is fairly close.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.086" offset="1924219">At any rate I think it is severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.265" offset="1936967">My college psychiatric course said the way to distinguish a psychotic, it has to go to the hospital and a neurotic need not.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.652" offset="1962567">That is maybe a lay definition or distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.496" offset="1977927">But the mental deficiency is the key because that is not defined in the statute, but the Ohio Supreme Court has construed it and they have construed it as being equivalent to mental retardation.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.237" offset="2044905">This was in their first post Furman capital case, State v. Bailus.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.111" offset="2068415">They cited two medical dictionaries, case law and the court psychiatrist in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.115" offset="2092343">In the medical dictionaries they cite -- indicate to further characterize what retardation is, is that a moron is the highest retard in intelligence and an idiot is the lowest in an imbecile is in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.568" offset="2166217">The authorities, psychiatric authorities cited in our brief indicated that a moron is someone with an IQ of 70 or less, a mental age of 12 or less and the other two are below that.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.662" offset="2218567">Therefore, under the Ohio statute, under this third mitigating circumstance, the only one dealing with the offender himself, only a psychotic, a moron, an imbecile or an idiot has a reasonable chance of surviving the sentencing process and then only if that condition, that mental condition caused the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.717" offset="2322743">The other statutory factors --</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="562.470" stopTime="564.301">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="562.470" offset="2329848">That is a fact finding, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_fred_hoefle" startTime="564.301" stopTime="844.992">
            <label>Mr. H. Fred Hoefle</label>
            <text syncTime="564.301" offset="2337163">That is, it is strictly fact finding, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.272" offset="2348970">And that is fact finding by the Trial Judge where the three, if it is a one, two or three judge panel as we did, then the three judges decide and they must unanimously find that none of these circumstances are present before they can sentence a man to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.344" offset="2405290">If one of the judges finds a circumstance present then the sentence is life, even though the other two may feel that the death penalty is warned.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.941" offset="2443638">The first of these three mitigating circumstances as it appears in the statute is victim inducement, that the victim induced or facilitated his own death.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.214" offset="2480732">If this can be shown to a preponderance, then the offender will escape with his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.647" offset="2502465">However, we must remember that we are talking about an aggravated murder situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.307" offset="2525140">Not all taking of life is aggravated murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.097" offset="2536320">One of the aggravating circumstances must be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.369" offset="2557427">The only one that I could conceive would be murder for hire, because that would involve the victim hiring his own killer.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.971" offset="2595775">I suppose if a case like that ever comes along, perhaps the victim inducement mitigation will have some significance, but we feel that it is basically illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.192" offset="2632660">Although, there was one Northern Ohio appellate case where the court did find victim inducement where the victim was armed and it involved a narcotics purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.479" offset="2677799">However, that unreported appellate case, added another element.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.616" offset="2694413">They said, that the only time you can even consider using victim inducement is mitigation as if the victim himself is acting unlawfully and that condition is not even in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.560" offset="2750211">The final mitigating circumstance is that it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed, but for the fact that the offender was under a duress, coercion or strong provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.317" offset="2801202">Duress and coercion though has been interpreted in Ohio's capital context by the Ohio Supreme Court is such compulsion that will overcome the mind or volition of the defendant, so that he acted other than he would ordinarily have acted in those circumstances which we feel at least more as the distinction if any between mitigating duress and coercion and the duress and coercion which is a defense to any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.615" offset="2910394">In our own case, they have further blurred that distinction by applying the doctrine of withdrawal, on page 142 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.620" offset="2974446">The court said, even if it were believe that appellant, that is Bell, was apprehensive of Hall and was forced to go along with the crimes, the hard fact remains that appellant could very easily have quit the scheme when following in another car.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.539" offset="3030034">And in the other case, the Woods case that we have referred to in our brief, the Ohio Supreme Court has in discussing the doctrine of withdrawal, withdrawal as applied to the defensive of duress, really blurred the distinction between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.029" offset="3096072">There really is no distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.976" offset="3103804">If a defendant is acting of his own free mind or will, then he is under such duress or coercion that makes him not guilty of the offense at all and he will not even have to worry about getting to a penalty trial, because he will be found not guilty at the close of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.802" offset="3183112">Now, it is important to note here, extremely important that these are three exclusive mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.805" offset="3215190">There are no other mitigating factors in Ohio, either in the statute, or in the interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.565" offset="3242149">There is a lot of talk about some other factors in some of the cases, but there are no other mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.782" offset="3283004">In our particular case, where we have alleged several mitigating factors which this Court has held to be constitutionally significant which we will discuss in a moment that basically they are the youth of the offender, his non participation in the offense, his cooperation with police, his drug involvement, his emotional disturbance, his domination by someone else, none of these factors were considered at least independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.981" offset="3383837">The Ohio Supreme Court said and this is at A 141 of the Appendix, we will examine each of the three mitigating circumstances provided for in the statute to determine if the evidence established with such a mitigating factor existed, that is the scope of the inquiry in an Ohio penalty trial and that is the only scope.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.992" offset="3459905">Well, if you place very much rest on this domination of the one by the other, you must also -- we must also, I suppose consider that at the time he was arrested, he was engaged in the same kind of an enterprise again.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.796" offset="3695112">Bell was still under the influence of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.351" offset="3705352">Hall drove the two to Dayton and as far as we know Bell had never been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.499" offset="3721966">Hall still had the shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.401" offset="3733564">The fact is I think that if we are talking about strong domination, that is the kind of -- if it is not particularly strong domination, maybe he would have broken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.301" offset="3769091">But strong domination which I think has been recognized as mitigating is the type of thing which will coerce someone in going along.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.386" offset="3829486">The fact remains further in discussing the mental deficiency aspect as defined by the Ohio Supreme Court that the court has had many cases before it where mental problems have been alleged and in not one has it reversed the sentence of death.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.194" offset="6576732">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.664" offset="6598570">I feel that the basic matter that is currently before this Court in so far as the Bell case is concerned and as I reflect it in my brief, as a center point between this Court's decisions in Furman and this Court's decisions in Woodson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.761" offset="6698985">In Furman we have unbridled discretion, in Woodson we have no discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.669" offset="6730645">Now, if we take the pronouncements of this Court in which it is reflected that there should be some discretion and that there the sentence should be tempered and adjusted as to the individual defendant, a party charged with an offense, the Supreme Court or this Court I should say has reflected that the courts should set forth with some specificity, the grounds of the aggravating circumstances and the grounds for the mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.592" offset="6910263">I do not believe that there is any question that the aggravating circumstances under Ohio law clearly follows the decisions of this Court in which the death penalty is precluded except in certain specific instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.613" offset="6970345">In other words, you do not get the death penalty in Ohio for every murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.929" offset="6995631">It is only where it is a calculated preconceived thought of murder, a perpetration of murder and relative to certain specific instances such as the assassination of the President, a person who is incarcerated where there are two or more persons who are supposed to be killed in an overall plot and they are specifically enumerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.335" offset="7097300">I do not believe that the petitioners in this Court have contested that aspect and I think that there should be no question whatsoever with regard to the first part of the statute at least delineating and eliminating the passing of the death penalty as to or the imposition of the death penalty relative to all murders in the state of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.355" offset="7197296">The second point is the one that I think is the basic point before this Court and that is the one as to whether or not a state has the authority to specify what mitigating circumstances will or will not be used, so that they can temper the imposition of the sentence with regard to the individual who is standing before them for the purpose of being sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.342" offset="7329267">I think that Ohio takes and follows the pronouncements of this Court as set forth in the group of cases set forth by Gregg and those that followed it, in which the Ohio legislature has set forth a statute whereby they specifically open the statute with the pronouncement regardless of whether one or more of the aggravating circumstances listed in Division A which is the specific types of murder for which the death penalty can be imposed, regardless, that is the first word, that death penalty for aggravated murder is precluded when considering the nature and circumstances of the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.242" offset="7960908">Now, I believe that this Court is bound to give the interpretation of the state statutes as reflected by the highest court of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.354" offset="8017332">This Court still has the final determination as to whether that state Court's interpretation of its statute still pass constitutional muster, but I think this Court, based on a long line of decisions is supposed to recognize that the highest court of a state has the right to interpret its statutes and to include that in the totality of the picture as to what the statute means or does not mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.759" offset="8134988">And without going through each of the items that are set forth in my brief, I believe that the Ohio Supreme Court has clearly reflected what the meaning of the statute is and broadened the condition, so as to determine and make a prerequisite and take into consideration the nature and circumstances of the offense.</text>
