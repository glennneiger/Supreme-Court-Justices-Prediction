            <text syncTime="72.491" offset="370505">The record in this case is a simple one and the basic facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.772" offset="395583">Of importance though, I believe, is that the Commonwealth of Kentucky had overwhelming proof of Mr. Hayes’ guilt.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Chenoweth</label>
            <text syncTime="128.256" offset="593486">The prosecutor offered a sentence recommendation to Mr. Hayes of five years on this uttering charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.428" offset="626192">This offer was rejected, although Mr. Hayes was advised prior to the rejection that an enhancement charge could be brought in view of Mr. Hayes’ two prior felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.461" offset="682303">After the rejection, the prosecutor did go back to the grand jury, did re-indict so as to include in the indictment an enhancement charge and the original substantive offense of uttering a force instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.534" offset="746668">The petitioner believes that it is important in this case to consider the unique character of an enhancement statute as it relates to plea negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.101" offset="788882">This Court in Oyler v. Boles indicated that an habitual criminal enhancement charge does not create a separate and distinct substantive offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.020" offset="832559">Let me interrupt you just a second, if I may, General Chenoweth.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.349" offset="849904">In the course of a plea bargaining, did the prosecutor offer to drop any of the charges or simply to make a sentence recommendation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_l_chenoweth" startTime="200.562" stopTime="340.960">
            <label>Mr. Robert L. Chenoweth</label>
            <text syncTime="200.562" offset="882714">At the time that the plea negotiations were going on at a pretrial conference, really two pretrial conferences, there was only the singular substantive offense of uttering a forged instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.224" offset="941437">It was really a sentence recommendation possibility and that there were no other charges to deal with at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.219" offset="969336">The basic plea-inducement capability at that time really was a sentence recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.527" offset="1006639">The enhancement statute does not constitute a substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.826" offset="1019805">I think that is very critical in view of the prosecutor’s broad discretionary powers in deciding whether to charge and what to charge, and especially so as this relates to the national interest for a number of reasons of a prosecutor seeking to enter into plea negotiations with the criminally accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.268" offset="1101516">This case then involves the timing and the scope of a prosecutor exercising his charging discretion when the possibility of an habitual criminal charge exist, a non-substantive offense, and a plea negotiation is nevertheless desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.010" offset="1176539">Now, if the prosecutor is faced with facts that will support an indictment on the substantive offense and a non-substantive enhancement charge, the prosecutor has to decide whether he wishes to indict the accused as a habitual offender and if so, he has further to decide whether to seek an indictment on that habitual criminal statute at the time the principal offense indictment is returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.182" offset="1293255">He is faced with that kind of decision when he has the facts initially before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.692" offset="1319273">Now, it may be that the prosecutor will decide that an indictment is proper under a habitual statute, but since the prosecutor, in looking at the facts of the case, has determined that he intends to offer some kind of plea-inducement on the substantive charge that he would decide that the plea negotiations can proceed more fairly and proceed more expeditiously if an indictment on the substantive offense only is sought at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.551" offset="1450721">Why would he reach that conclusion?</text>
            <text syncTime="344.828" offset="1459811">Do you think that plea bargaining is more likely to ensue with an initial lighter charge than the enhancement aspect?</text>

            <text syncTime="354.599" offset="1498890">Yes, very definitely, if I understand your question, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.533" offset="1518639">The very reason that a prosecutor will come to that kind of conclusion when he has those facts before him is that if he has a strong case, as there existed in the Hayes’ case, he has to realize that if he is going to enter into any kind of plea negotiations that he cannot enter into plea negotiations if there is an habitual charge already on the books.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.365" offset="1629921">Well, he has to be willing if he has already gotten the case to the posture of having an habitual charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.739" offset="1655416">He is going to have to be willing to remove that habitual charge before he can go to the prosecutor and say “I am willing to enter into plea negotiations,” because no defendant is ever going to plead guilty to a charge as long as that enhancement statute is still on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.181" offset="1721245">It will still continue to enhance whatever the plea arrangement that was arrived at.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.465" offset="1738381">So, the prosecutor has to be willing if that indictment on the habitual charge is brought in the beginning.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.011" offset="1764504">You are coming up from the other side of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.429" offset="1778192">Why does the prosecutor not bring everything in the original indictment or information, everything and take it from there with his plea bargaining, if that is what he wants?</text>

            <text syncTime="433.551" offset="1814659">Because if he brings everything, he is going to have to and he desires to go forward with plea negotiations, he is bringing an element into the negotiations that he really need not bring and that is the habitual criminal indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.091" offset="8392814">That does not preclude the mere fact you do not bring it in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.413" offset="8406188">It does not preclude the fact that that prosecutor has on his mind that if he cannot enter into a plea negotiation in view of the overwhelming evidence that he should not, in the interest of the society, then indict for the habitual felony offender so that the punishment that the statutes authorize should be placed in case for consideration by a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2231.437" offset="9006273">In the next instance, we have something legitimate done with actual vindictiveness and I believe it was Mr. Justice Powell pointing out in Michigan v.

            <text syncTime="2248.515" offset="9074505">In this case, the actual vindictiveness was to say “if you will exercise your constitutional right to a trial before a jury to plead not guilty, to have the right to confront witnesses against you, to be free from self-incrimination, I am going to put a penalty on it and that is the sole reason I am doing it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.585" offset="9150783">The Sixth Circuit found this in the penultimate paragraph of their opinion when they clearly said “we do not need to infer vindictiveness in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3801.228" offset="15285379">I think the Sixth Circuit addressed this quite clearly and perhaps it has been a mistake on my part to not point this out, but always, the prosecutor is allowed, as under your decisions in Blackledge and North Carolina v. Pearce to demonstrate changes that account for why he did not obtain the original indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3832.126" offset="15408990">That would be perfectly acceptable because the original indictment could not have anticipated the subsequent conduct like your U.S. v. Paige analogy in North Carolina v. Pearce.</text>
