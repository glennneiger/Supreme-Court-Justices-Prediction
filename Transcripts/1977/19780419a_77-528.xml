            <text syncTime="62.877" offset="251507">What interest does the government as an institutional litigator have in wanting a narrow construction of a statute enacted by Congress?</text>

            <text syncTime="72.567" offset="290168">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, of course the United States is a statutory separate party and is therefore a respondent in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.403" offset="329561">In this particular case, the United States has or the Department of Justice has a separate interest because it has an independent responsibility to enforce this statute quite separate from the commission's responsibility to enforce the same statute in its regulatory field.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.990" offset="399882">It is therefore appropriate it seems to us for the United States to speak the views of the Department of Justice in this case, since it must be bound by the decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="195.415" offset="781584">Indeed Mr. Justice White, I have cited in the brief the provisions of both the Communications Act and the judicial code which make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.589" offset="830276">Perhaps the clearest provision is that, in the judicial code and one finds it in Section 2342, first tells us that all in paragraph one there, that all final orders of the Federal Communications Commission made reviewable by Section 402(a) of Title 47 all covered by the following sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.922" offset="951589">This is such an order issued by the Commission under Section 402 of its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.231" offset="980846">When we then change to Section 2344, we note that an action brought in the Court of Appeal to review such an order is to be an action against the United States, and it further provides at the end of that provision that the clerk shall serve a true copy of the petition on the agency and on the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.834" offset="1091291">And when we return to Section 2348 of Title 28, we note that the Attorney General is responsible for and has control of the interests of the government in all Court proceedings under this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.036" offset="1156075">The agency and any party in interest may appear – I am skipping words -- as parties thereto of their own motion and as of right, primary responsibility of the Attorney General but independent right of the agency to be represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.923" offset="1231621">Hence here, the Commission, though not joined by the Solicitor General was authorized to file a petition for certiorari.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="316.036" offset="1264118">Mr. Claiborne, as it occurred to you that there may be a difference between relationship with the Department of Justice to let us say the Secretary of Defense, a Cabinet Officer and the relationship with what is thought of as an independent regulatory agency, which is not subject to in the same way surely to the direction of the Executive Branch.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="352.046" offset="1408104">Mr. Chief Justice that would certainly apply, apply with greater force in those circumstances where the agency was not free to represent itself before this Court, and where therefore, the Solicitor General would feel a greater inclination to support the independent Commission's view, which could otherwise not be presented to the Court, to when the agency has an independent right to appear here that considerations perhaps lessened.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.063" offset="1528163">This, however, is an unusual case, in that the Department of Justice has a quite separate responsibility under the statute, and therefore cannot be bound or overly influenced by the views of the Commission as it applies to the statute in a different field.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.130" offset="1596500">And indeed when this Court decided the ABC case in 347 of the United States reports, the Court relied on the construction of that anti-lottery statute for Communications Act, relied on the construction placed on that statute by the Attorney General and said it cannot have one meaning for the Commission and another for the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.129" offset="1720424">We notice that the Department of Justice does not view these programs as violating that statute, and we're influenced by that in holding that the Commission has ever stepped the line.</text>
