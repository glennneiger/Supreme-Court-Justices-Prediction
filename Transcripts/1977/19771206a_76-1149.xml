            <text syncTime="23.349" offset="173286">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.072" offset="188228">This case is here today for determination of the right for an award of general compensatory damages in a failure to provide an adequate due process hearing where the plaintiffs neither proved any individualized injury or any pecuniary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.403" offset="249564">The issue before this Court is whether or not the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit erred when it determined as a matter of law, general compensatory damages must be awarded for violation of the Civil Rights absent some proof of individualized injury or pecuniary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.695" offset="314661">Briefly, the record reflects the following facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.258" offset="328976">We have a consolidated matter before the Court, we have two plaintiffs Mr. Silas Brisco being the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.025" offset="352068">Mr. Brisco was a student Chicago public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.034" offset="368055">During the year of 1972-73, the school which he was attending was changing from a predominantly white school to that of the black school.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.736" offset="402850">During that time, the school officials noted that there were some gang activity in the school in around the area and some gang recruitment and had occasion to observe that during that period, wearing of an earing was -- that some student for wearing earings during that period of time and decided on that basis after conferring with two or three of the school officials determined that it was necessary in the interests of safety to ban the wearing of earings.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.025" offset="519984">Mr. Brisco was on actual notice of this ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.318" offset="533149">In May 1973 Mr. Brisco was observed wearing an earing.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.677" offset="550599">He was told to remove it, he refused to remove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.274" offset="565019">His mother was called then, after extensive conversation with the District Superintendent, Mr. Brisco removed the earing and no further incident occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.947" offset="595739">In September 1973, when school reconvened on September 11, Mr. Brisco again wore the earing to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.070" offset="624160">The System Principal and the Principal instructed Mr. Brisco to remove the earing, he denied. He refused to remove the earing.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.012" offset="655925">Mr. Brisco’s mother was called.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.998" offset="663866">She came in and she supported Mr. Brisco’s refusal to remove the earing and Mr. Brisco was suspended for 20 days for his failure to remove the earing.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.626" offset="698452">Mr. Brisco served 17 days of that suspension and was voluntarily readmitted pending motion for preliminary injunction at the trial District Court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.947" offset="735755">Mr. Piphus was a high school student in the Chicago public schools and on January 23, 1974, Mr. Piphus was observed that on school premises with another young man, outside the building, but on the school premises he was observed by the principal smoking and passing, what the principal characterizes an irregularly shaped cigarette.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.766" offset="823004">As the principal approached he had occasion to observe or smell an odor what he believed to be marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.705" offset="854769">As he approached, the cigarette was either discarded or at some point cigarette was discarded as he was taking the two pupils back to the -- The System principal was the disciplinary at the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.233" offset="900849">The two boys denied any smoking of any marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.673" offset="914641">They were taken back the Principal instructed the System Principal to follow the usual procedures of the 20 day suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.417" offset="941600">This was followed and Mr. Piphus was suspended along with the other young man for 20 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.412" offset="973574">Some time later subsequent to the District Superintendent reduced the suspension and Mr. Piphus was out of school for eight days.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.686" offset="1010668">The District Court in this matter sitting as a triar to fact on the stipulated record, determined that the defendants failed to provide an adequate due process hearing, because he determined that the 20 day suspension triggered a need for a full evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.221" offset="1084855">He further found that there was no good faith defense available to the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.761" offset="1102932">Although he did observe that Wood v. Strickland, in which this Court determined and qualified immunity to the board members and board employees, he did observe that we do not have to predict the future to constitutional law and since this case arose prior to Wood v. Strickland, he said that necessarily would not apply but the doctrine of Linwood v. Peoria, Seventh Circuit case which said that anything over seven days may trigger a need for a full evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.318" offset="1201153">He said, based upon that rationale the board would not be able to have a good faith defense and if that was unavailable to the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.238" offset="1236888">Although he did observe that this was not -- that obviously the educators were trying to or were upholding the integrity of this educational process.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.840" offset="1287252">He further found that although they were entitled to damages for the violation of the deprivation of an adequate due process hearing, there was no proof of any evidence submitted nor any evidence which would even lead to a speculative inference, to form any major of the damages and therefore he allowed no damages and the case was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.922" offset="1363634">The case went up to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.311" offset="1377218">There was a motion for reconsideration filed, on the issue of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.256" offset="1392996">The issue of damage was reopened and during dependency of the motion for reconsideration, the District Court judge passed away.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.240" offset="1420895">It was assigned to another District Court judge after considering the matter to the other District Court judge determined that the motion must be denied in the issue of damages and he stated the same reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.740" offset="1462899">Basically there was no proof of any damages and there was nothing which would lead to any speculative inference which would allow measurement as to the extent of damages so, he also denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.552" offset="1502083">The case went up to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on the issue of general compensatory damages and as I have indicated before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal held that as a matter of law, the two individuals were entitled to general compensatory damages which was inherent and naturally wrong and as a matter of law and the measure of damages were not so small to trivialize a right of so large as provided windfall.</text>

            <text syncTime="727.044" offset="2988137">The traditional law of damages --well, let me start from the case, this Court ruled in Monroe v.

            <text syncTime="746.266" offset="3065041">With that concept in mind, we believe that as long as the basis of liability for this 42 U.S.C. 1983 action should be read against Tort Liability we should then look to the relief granted in tort law to determine what relief should be granted for violations of this 42 U.S.C. 1983 actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="799.436" offset="3277678">To that extent we believe that the law in regarding compensatory damages has always been that you are entitled to compensatory when you have established your actual or your legal injury, your effect of damage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.155" offset="12348542">Given that the constitutional rights, our position cannot be separated from the from the intangible interests which those rights are intended to protect, it is not surprising that the common law has long recognized that the damages may be presumed from the violation of civil rights themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.163" offset="12404548">There are no special remedial rules for civil rights cases which exempt them from this normal rule that damages should be presumed where intangible injuries are the natural and proximate result of a violation and since 1703 in the English voting rights case of Ashby v. White, the common law has recognized the principle that every injury to a right import to damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.738" offset="12486886">Mr. Justice Holmes relied on this principle in Nixon v. Herndon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.150" offset="12500575">In that case, held that a valid claim for substantial damages were stated when the only harm alleged was the deprivation of Equal Protection which arose out of the denial of the right to vote on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.940" offset="12543729">I think our brief incorrectly describe that as a voting rights case but in fact it is an Equal Protection case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.632" offset="12570478">And there are also many other American voting rights cases that recognized this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.538" offset="12594093">Now, petitioner’s argument is not only contrary to these common law cases, it is also contrary to Congressional intent that courts apply, the most effective remedies that are available for the purpose of deterring violations of the constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.241" offset="12652921">It is clear from the Congressional debates and from many opinions of this Court that the primary purpose of Congress in enacting the Ku Klux Act of 1871 was to deter constitutional rights of the violations and in Section 1988 of Title 42 Congress gave the Court specific direction as to how they were to apply remedial principles under the Civil Rights Clause in order to achieve that deterrent purpose and as this Court stated in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, courts would use whichever federal and state rules on damages would better serve the policies of the Federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.027" offset="12791997">Now, the technical trespass damage rules proposed by petitioners would obviously be less effective in deterring civil rights violations than the damage rules in the voting rights case and these intangible injury cases and Nixon v. Herndon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.935" offset="12847690">A rule that required independent proof of injury for the award of damages for civil rights violations would give officials absolute immunity from damages where the nature of the constitutional right is such or the circumstances of a violation are such that affirmatively provable injury is unlikely to result from the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.120" offset="12924385">Examples of the First Amendment cases or due process, and it is exactly such absolute immunity the petitioners are asking for in their reply brief on page 28 where they query, whether as a result of the Seventh Circuit’s decision educators would have to think about it, they research, their own discretionary acts in terms of the possibility that a Court might find them liable for damages for violating a person’s civil rights, but it was precisely to force officials to give consideration to avoiding constitutional rights that this Court rejected educator’s claims of absolute immunity in Wood v. Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.297" offset="13069104">There is nothing about that particular type of compensatory damages awarded for the deprivation of civil rights which is relevant to whether educators should be allowed to violate constitutional rights, free of any concern for their accountability under the Civil Rights Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.741" offset="13130857">The rationale would require us that public officials not be given such a zone of immunity for their constitutional violations where the interest protected by the rights are of such an intangible, unquantifiable nature.</text>
