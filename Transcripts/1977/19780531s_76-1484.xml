            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80070">The other announcement I have is -- as Justice Brennan indicated is Zurcher against Stanford Daily number 76-1484 and Bergna against Stanford Daily, number 76-1600.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.151" offset="148615">These cases are here on Writ of Certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.903" offset="175678">Under traditional Fourth Amendment law, the Fourth Amendment has permitted warrants to search property on which there is probable cause to believe, there is located fruits, instrumentalities, or evidence of a crime regardless of who owns the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.417" offset="281735">We are now asked to reconstrue the Fourth Amendment and to hold for the first time that when the place to be searched is occupied by a person not then suspected of a crime, that only in the most unusual circumstances should a search warrant be issued, rather it is suggested, a subpoena duces tecum should be employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.546" offset="394166">This was the holding of the District Court which was adopted by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.876" offset="415482">We decline to adopt this rather sweeping revision of the Fourth Amendment and accordingly, have filed an opinion disagreeing with the Court of Appeals in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.822" offset="463339">The lower courts also held that whatever the rule might be generally with respect to Third - so called third-party searches, where the third-party isn't suspected of crime, that a search warrant should not issue, but a subpoena duces tecum should be used when the third party is a newspaper, that is when the premises to be searched is occupied by a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.315" offset="585278">We also disagree with this narrower holding and in our view, the whatever First Amendment considerations, there might be in a situation like this can be satisfactorily accommodated by a careful application of the usual criteria governing the issue of search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.522" offset="702098">As I say, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Marshall has joined him.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.655" offset="754656">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the case.</text>
