            <label>Mr. George W. Lindberg</label>
            <text syncTime="50.254" offset="280912">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.411" offset="293555">I represent the Illinois State, defendants in this cause and I intend to argue for approximately 15 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.403" offset="329500">I will argue the position that Illinois can maintain a Special Assistance Program for Emergency Needs under its regular AFDC Special Needs Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.514" offset="381954">Mr. Keith Jones, the Deputy Solicitor General, represents the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare also a defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.706" offset="418734">He will argue the balance of the time and specifically address the subjects of the basic statutory scheme underlying the AFDC and Emergency Assistance Programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.220" offset="468785">He will distinguish the two programs, one from the other and he will argue why the Social Security Act does not impose mandatory eligibility requirements on the state in that regard and he will establish why after, the first Mandley decision in this case, the first Mandley decision, the case became moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.153" offset="568572">This case arose when the plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that the Illinois Emergency Assistance Program violated Section 606 (e) of the Social Security Act under which Illinois operated the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.499" offset="637954">The Illinois Plan for Emergency Assistance covered essentially four kinds of emergency needs for AFDC eligible individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.743" offset="694900">Homelessness due to damage of the structure, homelessness due to partial damage of the structure, and the court ordered evictions, except for the non payment of rent and there was a provision for ADC applicants who had not yet obtained eligibility or have been established eligible that they could have food, clothing, household goods, and equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.779" offset="807018">The plaintiffs’ allegations in attacking the plan allege that the Illinois Emergency Assistance Program, as then operated, did not address the emergency needs of all destitute children.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.103" offset="888311">The plaintiffs in the case, the individuals were persons who had applied for and had been denied emergency assistance in that their particular need was not one of those met by the criterion that I mentioned a few moments ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.495" offset="965947">These attacks were all principally made in Count 1 of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.271" offset="984964">Count 2 then went on to address allegations that the Illinois Plan violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause because it did not provide emergency assistance to all persons facing destitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.051" offset="1052151">The District Court had found for the State defendants and for the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, that is, it did not find a violation of the Supremacy Clause and it did in fact find that the Illinois Plan created under 606 (e) did not violate 606 (e) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.334" offset="1133235">The plaintiffs appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed the District Court and found that the Illinois Plan more narrowly defined eligibility than is permitted in the court’s opinion under 606 (e) of the Social security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.650" offset="1218499">This has been referred to as the Mandley I decision because there was a second appeal which I will address in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.437" offset="1245666">The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the court’s holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.094" offset="1280252">The defendants then made a motion to dismiss the case as moot for the reason that the State of Illinois had withdrawn its Emergency Assistance Program under Section 606 (e), and instead, opted to operate an Emergency Needs Program under the regular AFDC Special Needs Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.070" offset="1420164">The plaintiffs’ answer to that motion said that Illinois was continuing to operate its Emergency Assistance Program and not under Section 606 (e), but under Section 402 and of course, it is correct that Illinois was operating a program of emergency assistance under its ADC Provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.107" offset="1508354">The District Court offered the plaintiff ample opportunity to amend its complaint and address the new program under Section 402 of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.546" offset="1570107">The plaintiffs refused to amend its complaint and some months later the District Court granted the defendants’ motion and dismissed the case as moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.696" offset="1646698">The plaintiffs again appealed to the Seventh Circuit and the Court of Appeals, again having a second opportunity at this case, concluded that the District Court erred, the case was not moot and most importantly, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals found that 606 (e) is now the exclusive statutory channel to receive federal reimbursement for the operation of an Emergency Assistance Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.296" offset="1789118">Again, the decision was sent to the District Court and the court entered an order that was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.756" offset="1834989">The state and the Secretary filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.203" offset="1872709">The results of the Seventh Circuit holding in Mandley II is that states now can only look to Section 606 (e) of the Social Security Act to operate an Emergency Assistance Program for needy children.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.398" offset="1961526">It is the position of the State of Illinois that there is no support anywhere in the Act, in the legislative history, in the administrative interpretation of the decisions of the Act or the decisions of this court that support the holding of the Seventh Circuit, and in fact what is available, suggests just the opposite conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.768" offset="2075002">That 606 is not the exclusive mechanism for the operation of emergency systems program.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.971" offset="2107811">The Social Security Act establishes the basic framework of supporting the operation of the AFDC Program by the states and the regulations of the Secretary, perhaps as far back as 1949, recognized and authorized a Special Needs Program under the conventional AFDC Program operated by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.325" offset="2229229">Specifically, I would draw the Court’s attention to Section 23-233.20 of the Code of Federal Regulations, if you will look in the yellow copy which is the original brief of the state petitioners on A9, you will see the language quoting, this is 233.20a25, if the state agency includes special need items in its standard, parenthetical A describes that they will be recognized in the circumstances under which they will be included and provide that they will be considered and need determination for all applicants and recipients requiring them.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.776" offset="2446985">Now, this is the Secretary’s acknowledgment that special need items are permissible under the regular AFDC Program and it is the position of the State of Illinois that for many years, emergency needs, non-reoccurring needs of AFDC recipients have been in fact met under that provision, special needs and it has been of course as I have indicated, recognized by the Secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.701" offset="4034708">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.291" offset="4049127">The Solicitor General authorized the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in this case on behalf of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare because it was believed that the decisions below are counterproductive in terms of the legislative purpose of encouraging emergency assistance and also in terms of the interest of the very welfare recipients that the Court of Appeals thought it was assisting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.264" offset="4144945">The legal implications of the decision below are that the federal government may no longer reimburse state payments of AFDC Emergency Assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.032" offset="4184024">Second, that states that wish to make federally reimbursable payments to AFDC recipients in order to alleviate the hardship that may result from emergencies, must do so not under an AFDC Plan, but under and EA Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.518" offset="4254032">Third, all state EA Plans, whether newly created or preexisting, must afford relief to all needy families with children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.058" offset="4292171">You cannot just carve out certain groups who would be eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.909" offset="4307531">They must provide need not in just certain enumerated emergencies, but in all circumstances entailing the risk of destitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.301" offset="4345147">The foreseeable practical consequence and implication of this decision, we believe, would be that many states that now provide EA or AFDC Emergency Assistance would be required to simply abandon emergency relief all together because they simply could not afford the extensive program devised by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.281" offset="4429052">In our view, this disruption of state welfare plans and policies is not required by the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.985" offset="4455906">The burden of my argument here is that decisions below rest upon a misreading of the scope of the AFDC and EA Programs under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.820" offset="4499165">I will begin with the AFDC Program which is by far the larger and more important of these two programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.801" offset="4527168">Under AFDC, the federal government reimburses a portion of state payments of eight families with dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.704" offset="4558724">Section 406 (a) and (b) of the Act define a dependent child roughly as a needy child who has been deprived of parental support and care as a result of the death, absence, or disability of a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.769" offset="4622985">In order to qualify for federal reimbursement for AFDC payments, the state must submit a plan to the Secretary that satisfies the requirements of Section 402 (a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.519" offset="4678051">If the Secretary approves the plan, the state payments are reimbursed according to the formula set forth in Section 403 (a) (1) of the Act under which, as a practical matter, the federal reimbursement ranges from 50% to 65%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.479" offset="4749836">Alternatively, in some cases, the state may elect to have reimbursement determined under Section 1905 of the Act and under that provision, federal reimbursement will range from 50% to a maximum of 83%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.869" offset="4823397">The normal mode of assistance contemplated by AFDC is regular monthly payments based upon continuing need, but the Secretary consistently, and from the beginning and from before the enactment of the EA Program, has approved state plans that provide for supplemental payments to meet special non recurring needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.299" offset="4921095">At least some states have included within their AFDC Plans, have included within the non recurring items, emergency needs arising from, for example natural or man-made disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.261" offset="4976997">Now unfortunately, as has been pointed out, in part because of the manner in which this litigation has proceeded, the record is not satisfactory with respect to prior administrative practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.259" offset="5028928">The Secretary has never formally defined the special need items for which, since 1949 and not before, the state has been entitled to reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.821" offset="5071247">In an answer to your question Mr. Justice Stewart, it is clear that the states have included emergency items within their state AFDC Plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.382" offset="5225474">I think that is not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.959" offset="5235714">I think that a total of 45 jurisdictions that includes not only states but certain territories, includes some kind of special need item in their AFDC Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.173" offset="5292660">Unfortunately, although I would have thought at the outset of this litigation, we could have identified the precise count of the number of states that provide emergency assistance under their AFDC Plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.330" offset="5349294">The fact that state plans are not sufficiently specific to permit us to tell the Court exactly the number of states, but just to give the Court an idea, I will read to you from this booklet a description of two state plans which I have selected at random just here at the argument, “Michigan has a special circumstance item which is described as faultless, the provisions for medical transportation, access shelter when required to preserve equity in home or because of family size or other unusual circumstances,” and that is all it says and I cannot determine from that whether it covers the kinds of emergencies with which we are concerned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.952" offset="5547720">Let me read to you another one in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.476" offset="5561826">It covers provisions for supplies for college or training school, attendant care, camp fees, life insurance premium, home delivered meals, replacement of clothing lost in fire, flood, or other catastrophe, purchase of essential furniture required for establishment of a home, repair of essential heating equipment, cooking stoves and refrigerators and I will skip some of the items, restaurant allowance, temporary shelter and hotel, and allowance to meet increased needs of pregnant mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.246" offset="5708948">There are variety of special needs there, but it is clear that some of them include emergency needs that arise from fire or other catastrophes.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1417.678" offset="5750639">I suppose the best test of the administrative interpretation of special need items is its, as you are standing here on behalf of the agency and I guess that they do include what Illinois is now doing?</text>

            <text syncTime="1436.150" offset="5824514">Actually, there is very little, if anything, in the record in this case which establishes prior administrative practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.870" offset="5855442">Perhaps, one reason of why there has been little emphasis on these special items in the past is that since AFDC provides for regular monthly payments, in many cases emergency needs can be promptly translated into a decrease in assets or an increase in expenses, and therefore, reflected in the changing calculus of monthly benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.153" offset="5968500">Now for that or for some other reason, it is true that the Secretary’s construction of the Act has not been widely publicized, but there can be no doubt that the AFDC Program in fact has been construed as permitting reimbursement of AFDC emergency benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.196" offset="6228680">Well, there are some minor differences between the two programs that I will reach in a moment and I have no independent knowledge of whether those differences affected the state’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.264" offset="6281029">It may be that the state was ill-advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.113" offset="6292419">On the other hand, I should point out that the State of Illinois, at the present, is at the 50% level in its AFDC reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.858" offset="6335364">The formula under which federal reimbursement is calculated depends upon a ratio, in part at least, on the ratio of per capita income in state, per capita income in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.512" offset="6390012">Right now, that works out so that Illinois receives the minimum reimbursement under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.287" offset="6421046">So for Illinois, in terms of the direct monitory reimbursement, there was probably no difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.551" offset="6458140">I do not know, Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.442" offset="6465663">I know that since 1975 it has been the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.485" offset="6485829">At any rate, our submission is that the remedial purpose of the AFDC legislation and its broad language compels the conclusion that the Secretary is authorized to reimburse the states for their emergency payments under that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.648" offset="6554479">Now whereas the AFDC Program is designed to meet the needs of a statutorily defined families with dependent children, that is, of one parent or of no-parent families, the EA Program is designed to afford short-term assistance to a much broader category of families without regard to the requirement of dependency that is the lynch pin of the AFDC Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.507" offset="6653954">As is the case with AFDC, a state must submit to the Secretary, an EA Plan, that satisfies the applicable requirements of Section 402 (a) of the Act in order to qualify for federal reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.133" offset="6716438">Some of the requirements of Section 402 (a) do not apply to the EA Plans however and in particular, the requirement in Section 402 (a) (10), that benefits be paid to all persons who satisfy the federal definition of eligibility, by its terms applies only to the AFDC Plans and not to EA Plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.113" offset="6804419">Instead, the Secretary has indicated, by regulation, that the states may set their own EA eligibility conditions and they specify the particular emergency needs that their EA Plans will meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.273" offset="6865023">Now, a major difference between EA and AFDC, as we have already discussed, is the difference in the applicable formulas that determine the federal reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.680" offset="6906610">EA has always have 50%, whereas, depending upon the formulas that apply, AFDC reimbursement may be from 50-83%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.411" offset="6945585">In this connection, I would like to point out a correction that we had made in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.416" offset="6969617">In footnote 16 at page 27 of our brief, we had indicated that in some circumstances, the formula for determining EA and AFDC reimbursement may be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.292" offset="7025101">That statement is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.935" offset="7031684">We pointed out in a letter to the clerk last August, which I understand has been distributed to the Court, that different formulas always will apply to these two programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1771.276" offset="7165013">One of these has already been alluded to, whereas, AFDC assistance may be continuous and emergency needs may be met whenever they arise, EA assistance is available only, as the statute says, for a period not in excess of 30 days in any twelve-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.842" offset="7239305">In other words, under EA, a family is limited to one emergency per year and there is no similar limitation under the AFDC Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.214" offset="7280788">There are other differences, as we point out in our brief at pages 23-27, relating to work requirements, age limitations, living arrangements within the family, and family income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.010" offset="7351945">With this statutory background in mind, it is somewhat easier to understand the inception and follow the progress of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.687" offset="7386636">In 1973, as has been indicated, the State of Illinois adapted an EA Plan and the Secretary approved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.621" offset="7446404">The EA Plan covered only AFDC beneficiaries and provided benefits in certain enumerated circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.959" offset="7483811">As I have indicated, it is not entirely clear why the state chose to provide EA coverage since it could have simply amended its AFDC Plan to cover the same beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.776" offset="7543057">Nevertheless, the state did adapt an EA program and this litigation resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.730" offset="7566881">The respondents have challenged that EA Program on two related grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.574" offset="7586211">First, they claim that the state's plan is to narrow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.865" offset="7603348">It should be extended to all needy families with children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.290" offset="7617036">Second, they contend the state should provide assistance whenever necessary to avoid destitution and not just in certain enumerated emergencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.811" offset="7663220">Our position, in essence, is that these contentions fail to make out a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.313" offset="7697180">The respondents have not been unable to point to a source of positive law that entitles them to the extended EA coverage which they seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.070" offset="7736154">Their claim is that Section 406 (e), which defines emergency assistance to needy families with children, constitutes a federal definition of EA eligibility and that Section 402 (a) (10) of the Act makes that definition mandatory upon the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.719" offset="7826851">Section 406 (e), the definition, does not purport to establish eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.299" offset="7853078">It does no more than define the outer perimeter within which the Secretary may make reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.466" offset="7881813">Now in doing so, Section 406 (e) does define, in a general way, a class of potentially eligible EA recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.959" offset="7923714">But, Section 402 (a) (10) does not require a participating state to make EA payments to anyone who is eligible to receive them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.078" offset="7964256">As the Court of Appeals recognized, and as the parties here now apparently agree, 402 (a) (10) by its terms is limited to just the AFDC Plans, not to EA Plans. Accordingly, in so far as it rests upon the statute at all, respondent’s argument boils down to an inference from Section 402 (a) (10) that Congress intended to impose mandatory eligibility standards upon state, EA Programs as well as upon state AFDC Programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.209" offset="8100719">This argument has, we believe, three separate and independently conclusive answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.688" offset="8122662">First, the logical inference to be drawn from the statutory text is just opposite to that that the respondents would draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.744" offset="8158920">Since Congress explicitly made 402 (a) (10) applicable only to the AFDC Program, it must be inferred that Congress intended that that provision would not apply to the EA Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.854" offset="8211374">Secondly, the respondents’ argument in this case is inconsistent with this Court’s reasoning in New York Department of Social Services against Dublino.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.574" offset="8258185">In that case, the Court determined that in the absence of a clear manifestation of congressional intention, Section 402 (a) of this Act, this very Section, would not be read as restraining the considerable latitude that the states must be allowed in setting their own welfare policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.654" offset="8350554">Here, there is no such clear manifestation of legislative intent and the respondents’ argument, by implication, does not remedy that deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.478" offset="8389842">Third, the task of interpreting and applying the statute has been delegated in the first instance to the Secretary and the Secretary has construed the Act as granting the states leeway to set their own EA eligibility standards and that construction should be accorded deference in the absence of compelling legislative history to the contrary and there is none here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.685" offset="8498616">In this regard, I would like to dispel any confusion that may have been created by the respondents’ claim that the Secretary’s regulations have been superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.272" offset="8541039">Secondly, respondents in their brief contend that the so called Townsend regulations, which the Secretary adapted in the wake of this Court’s decisions in King against Smith, Townsend against Swank, and Carleson against Remillard, supersede the specific EA regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.726" offset="8626825">But, the Townsend regulations do no more than acknowledge the Townsend line of decisions which were that 402 (a) (10) imposes mandatory federal eligibility requirements on AFDC Programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.299" offset="8685131">All the regulations do is say in effect, that the states must abide by the requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.323" offset="8717209">The regulations do not go further and attempt to define those requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.101" offset="8736331">In particular, they do not purport to require the states to abide by mandatory federal EA eligibility requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.844" offset="8775305">Accordingly, the Townsend regulations have not superseded the Secretary’s more specific regulations relating to the EA Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.184" offset="8816683">For all of these reasons, we submit that the Court of Appeals erred in its first decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.056" offset="8840194">The states participating in the EA Program are not required to pay benefits to every needy family with children in every circumstance presenting the risk of destitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.633" offset="8886482">Instead, they may set their own reasonable eligibility standards and limit relief to those circumstances as emergency needs that they deem most compelling.</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.043" offset="11376056">I believe that the arguments that you have heard petitioners point out the difficulties that they bring to the Court when they do not follow orderly appellant procedures and I would like to briefly state what the procedures have been so far in my opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.546" offset="11434153">More than two years ago the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Mandley I held that Illinois cannot grant federally funded emergency assistance to some needy families eligible under 406 (e) of the Social Security Act while denying it to equally eligible families under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.911" offset="11507609">This decision came approximately two years after the complaint was filed in the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.590" offset="11534254">In so holding that Illinois’ definition of emergency need conflicted with the federal definition of emergency assistance to needy families with children contained in Title V (a) of Social Security Act, the Court of Appeals filed a line of unanimous decisions of this Court starting with King v. Smith, Townsend v. Swank, Remillard v. Carleson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.035" offset="11620040">Now, rather than comply with the Court of Appeals’ ruling or abandon federal funds or petition this Court for certiorari, the Illinois welfare officials with the cooperation and approval of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare implemented a fictitious abandonment of federal funds for emergency assistance which has enabled it to maintain is the illegal program for more than two years after the judgment in Mandley I.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.320" offset="13025219">In addition, they provided emergency help for families already receiving regular AFDC or families eligible to receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.803" offset="13059178">In fact, the Senate report noted that this type of family would be the typical type of family that would be eligible for emergency assistance, the family who is eligible to receiving AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.458" offset="13109751">The legislation authorizing emergency needs to be met immediately by giving flexibility as to the form of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.381" offset="13137441">A state could provide the payment in a hurry by cash, in kind, by vendor payments or such other methods as the state might specify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.044" offset="13180073">The program was optional with the states and it was limited to a 30-day period in the twelve-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.662" offset="13210584">And to encourage the states to participate, Congress offered the states 50% matching funds for payments made as emergency assistance. Now under this legislation, there are five points of eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.023" offset="13256037">There must be a needy child under the age of 21 living now or recently with a relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.036" offset="13288115">The child must be without available resources and the payment must be necessary to avoid the destitution of a child or to provide the living arrangements in a home for a child and neither the child nor the relative can have refused without good cause to accept employment or training for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.286" offset="13381111">In 1971, Illinois adapted its first Emergency Assistance Program under Section 406 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.518" offset="13405980">It provided nearly complete eligibility in terms of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.144" offset="13428549">It provided that the aid would be given from the local offices throughout the state by a dispersing order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.330" offset="13449238">That is a form given to a merchant for say $10 for food or $15 for clothing, or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.268" offset="13481003">In 1973, the state administratively constricted eligibility in the face of contrary state legislation which requires them to have a full program and limited emergency assistance to new applicants for AFDC, to recipients who were homeless from result of fire, and recipients who were evicted for reasons other than non payment of rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.169" offset="13572641">Now I have noticed in their regulations just this summer that they have eliminated even those evictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.512" offset="13593957">So now, any family evicted in Illinois who is without available resources cannot receive any emergency assistance from the Public Aid Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.687" offset="13630633">In addition, they excluded all non-AFDC eligible families.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.642" offset="13650486">As a result of this, no relief from destitution was available to many families lacking food and clothing, all evictions now, crimes against persons of property, utility, failures of turn offs as a result of agency error or delay, or if a child is abandoned by a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.057" offset="13732197">The state also centralized the distribution of emergency assistance in the state capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.636" offset="13750482">After an applicant’s request was approved, the case were to mail the form, just bring it for final approval and then if that was approved there, a check was mailed back to the recipient somewhere in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.155" offset="13816520">As a result of these procedures, Illinois cut its expenditures for emergency assistance from $2.5 million a year to $500,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.379" offset="13861451">In doing so, they referred many of the people they used to aid to private charities, some of whom may have joined this suit as amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.001" offset="13895932">For instance, the United Way of Metropolitan Chicago, one of its components, the Counsel for Community Services which is an umbrella group of about 280 private charities or social service agencies as amicus curiae in this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.916" offset="13955596">These charities, lacking a regular budget to provide the need that the state has traditionally provided and ought to provide, have been unable to help many of these poor people and these people then are now just suffering, bearing their own suffering, as this Court said I think in the Maricopa County case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.572" offset="14022260">Illinois testified that at the trial the reasons they constricted the program were for administrative ease and to prevent abuses and fraudulent applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.252" offset="14064892">The District Court ruled that the Department was processing applications much too slow that delays of 7-10 days in assistance were not in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.726" offset="14114838">They held for the state and federal defendants on the eligibility provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.173" offset="14136572">On appeal, the Court of Appeals in Mandley I reversed holding that Illinois could not constrict eligibility among needy families following the line of decisions that this Court has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.288" offset="14189026">It is an important principle that they follow because, by doing so, they ensure that people get the aid that Congress meant to have the aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.720" offset="14218806">Further, the court in Mandley I followed what I think is a traditional pattern and practice in litigation, at least from my knowledge of it, when they invalidate a regulation of an agency, be it federal or state, they did not order HEW to file draft regulations with the court that conform to Mandley I.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.094" offset="14296337">They suggested that it would be helpful to the states and to the courts if HEW would exercise its rule making power to give a new regulation to replace the one that the court invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.457" offset="14369794">In following the principle, this Court has said, which I believe is stated succinctly in Townsend v. Swank, that states may not vary eligibility requirements from federal standards in the absence, at least, of an authorization clearly evidenced upon the Act or its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.933" offset="14439697">The Court of Appeals, by that a test to the Illinois situation and it found in Section 406 (e) (1) two areas of state discretion and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.090" offset="14476269">It found an area of discretion for the form of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.813" offset="14495181">The state could, as I said, make cash or vendor payments and it found that the states could in 406 (e) (2) include migrant workers if they wished, but there was no evidence in the Act to allow it to exclude the families that Illinois had excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.783" offset="14579087">This pointing out various state discretions is, as this Court noted in Townsend, cogent evidence that Congress intended no further discretion to be given to the states to narrow eligibility and indeed, the petitioners point to no evidence on the basis --</text>

            <text syncTime="3662.198" offset="14728716">My answer is that there was an error in their understanding, I believe, of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.421" offset="14749614">First, we would say that the result is the same whether 402 (a) (10) applies or not because the principle of this Court’s decisions is the conflict of the state regulation with the federal statute and not 402 (a) (10).</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.099" offset="14808337">In 402 (a) (10), the court focused on making sure that all eligible individuals receive assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.459" offset="14837803">For instance, in Townsend the court italicized the term “all eligible” twice in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.014" offset="14868001">Moreover, 402 (a) (10) would not had normally have an emergency assistance because it is an optional program with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.916" offset="14911573">This is our argument that applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.235" offset="14920873">Once a state opts to provide emergency assistance, then 402 (a) (10) would become operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.455" offset="14949712">In other words, the term “aid the families with dependent children” includes whatever aid is provided under Title V (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="4256.668" offset="17106590">They cited this Handbook of Public Assistance Administration and Regulation which was the book or regulations HEW had before they begin promulgating them into Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations and they read that special need regulation to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.583" offset="17182241">There is no mention in it of an emergency assistance. What they did not mention in their briefs or in their argument here is that prior to 1968, HEW had some regulatory material on emergency situations that we cited in our brief as Section 34.2 of the Handbook of Public Assistance Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.076" offset="17268236">They had one on emergency payees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.121" offset="17280461">They had a Section on emergency situations prior to complete the determinations of eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.816" offset="17307211">If HEW had any authority at all to provide emergency assistance, it would have been under these provisions, but I think it is clear from the testimony of their administration’s only witness at the senate hearings who was Under Secretary Wahlberg Cone that HEW had not viewed that they had not authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.294" offset="17385056">Under Secretary Cone testified that there was no mechanism in existing law to meet the emergency needs of children in a crisis situation and remarks on the floor of both the Senate and the House reflect that it was the new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.369" offset="17441376">There was a change in the existing law that for the first time, the federal government will match the payments for emergency assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.540" offset="17466035">So I think it is pretty clear, whatever may have been before, the congressional direction in 1968 clearly pointed the way for states to provide emergency assistance if they provided it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.664" offset="17510548">Under the Cooperative Federalism which pervades the Social Security Act, the states do not have the ability to tailor eligibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="4513.602" offset="18134352">I do want to make a reference to this idea that the 45 states provide special needs and I believe that there is an inference that many states provide emergency assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.609" offset="18186388">Well, I think one of them did say that only five states provided assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.490" offset="18201852">From what we have gleaned from this document of HEW, which is not really very clear, only five states provides some very limited items of assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.913" offset="18235602">But in their brief, HEW concedes 27 states participate in the Emergency Assistance Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.793" offset="18263083">15 of them and I am not sure if this is in the brief, but 15 of them have full eligibilities required by Section 406 (e) and the other 12 have different degrees of eligibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="4567.478" offset="18349810">We believe that Mandley II was clearly correct on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.446" offset="18361722">It is an analysis of the legislation and the history of the legislation, I think, prohibits their conduct and prohibits their claiming funds in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.541" offset="18394114">If they have had a reasonable basis for believing it, I think that they would advanced it long before presenting it for the first time to the Court of Appeals in Mandley II.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.044" offset="18432148">They never told the District Court on remand that “we can do it this way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.432" offset="18445627">They wanted to keep it a secret, an administrative secret perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.255" offset="18460987">It was and they kept it a judicial secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.630" offset="18470496">I do not see how a court can function unless it gets full advocacy of the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.392" offset="18509470">I would like to turn, if I may, to the relief question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.793" offset="18527129">The facts show that this is a most unusual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.446" offset="18541758">I think it is a unique case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.650" offset="18554505">HEW had issued a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.326" offset="18565268">It was invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.495" offset="18569865">The regulation on emergency assistance, Your Honor, was invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.982" offset="18587838">The Court in Mandley I invited HEW to issue a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.867" offset="18603407">HEW did not issue a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.094" offset="18612288">It did not petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.931" offset="18631619">It approved Illinois’ plan without any regulation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.415" offset="18645620">This is a message to the states that you can ignore Mandley I.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.924" offset="18655651">You can ignore judicial decisions because we are going to put the stamp on your plan and you need to carry that over to the Secretary of the Treasury to collect your 50% reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.820" offset="18703194">They also did not redefine their special need regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.150" offset="18716569">They could have put ineligibility standards in that if they really believe that they could do it under AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.645" offset="18738512">They could have put in a timeliness requirement because under AFDC, there is no forthwith requirement as there is in emergency assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.558" offset="18774143">The only requirement now is that a person receive assistance within 45 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.660" offset="18790548">An emergency assistance delays is emergency assistance denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.050" offset="18812177">They did not make any recommendations to Congress that they needed new legislation or hold any hearings in the states to see if there were any problems in administering an Emergency Assistance Program as the Court of Appeals in Mandley I defined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.514" offset="18869960">They engaged in the circumvention of the mandate and the Court of Appeals in Mandley II found that they had indeed circumvented the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.044" offset="18900053">Under those circumstances, within three years since the complaint was filed in a case involving the needs of people in the most dire straights in the one year since the mandate had been returned with no action by HEW, I would not say no action, they have approved the plan illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.681" offset="18958672">The court, considering Mandley I was a final judgment, granted what we believe was equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.517" offset="18985944">It ordered HEW not to approve plans inconsistent with 406 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.274" offset="19005065">It directly then issued a new regulation to replace the old one and I think that this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.994" offset="19039860">They modified the judgment that was proposed by the plaintiffs and they removed from it the requirement on HEW to define certain terms of the 406 (e) definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.375" offset="19085418">I think perhaps it is best and easiest to just cite what the Court of Appeals said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.362" offset="19109346">“It did not require HEW to define necessary to avoid destitution or lack of available resources.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.205" offset="19136722">Those terms were not really at issue in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.743" offset="19150933">What the court said was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.153" offset="19156576">“While it would be salutary to include such definitions in the new regulation, while the Secretary might find it necessary as a matter of administrative practicality to include any items in this new regulation -- to include them, we will not order HEW specifically to include any items in this new regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.403" offset="19237555">Of course, whatever regulations the Secretary issues, it must be consistent with today’s opinion in Mandley I.</text>

            <text syncTime="4816.068" offset="19344239">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.193" offset="19356674">I would like to clarify our position in regard to emergency assistance and special needs or emergency assistance as a special need.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.064" offset="19392200">Our position is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.584" offset="19398260">If a state should be allowed by this Court to grant emergency assistance as a special need.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.084" offset="19428249">A state must still do so in accordance with the eligibility requirements of Section 406 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.880" offset="19451446">Congress in Section 403 (a) (5) of the Act, which is the funding provision, provides that for federal reimbursement if a state makes payments as emergency assistance to needy families with children and that a statute is contained in the yellow brief at page A4, on A4 is a continuation of the full statute set out, it begins at A2, and at A4 (subparagraph 5), and the previous parts would read with it, “The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to each state which has an approved plan for aiding services to needy families with children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.884" offset="19655514">In the case of any state, an amount of 50% of the total amount expended under the state plan during such quarter as emergency assistance to needy families with children.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.102" offset="19700340">This language reflects that Congress contemplated the function of emergency assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.554" offset="19722179">If it had just meant emergency assistance in 406 (e), it might have said “of” emergency assistance to needy families with children, but it said “as.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.632" offset="19758437">I can think of no better words to sum it all up than to repeat what Judge Cummings said writing for the court in Mandley II, “a rose is a rose, is a rose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.439" offset="19801696">Emergency assistance is emergency assistance no matter what the state may call it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.699" offset="19822698">The Solicitor General, here today, acknowledges that he does not know why the state participated in 406 (e) if they can do the same thing as a special need.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.784" offset="19867106">I suppose the we could all say that if that view should prevail here that we do not know why Congress enacted 406 (e), but we think Congress had that special reason to enact it and that was to make sure that all needy families with children who face these dire circumstances and had no available resources to meet emergency needs receive some aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.119" offset="19964386">A contrary result would mean that Congress’ statute would be, as the Court of Appeals said in Mandley II, totally eviscerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.571" offset="20010257">On the other points, there are ways concerning relief both as to federal and state defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.216" offset="20040768">We believe that they are fully covered in our briefs and there has not been any contest on their part about them that we believe that the Court of Appeals was clearly correct in ordering the relief that it did, and that it should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.049" offset="20100118">The result recently in Mandley I and in Mandley II is a just result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.181" offset="20116628">Our elected representatives have adapted a sound social policy in the emergency assistance provisions of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.784" offset="20147034">The federal and state welfare agencies charged with the duty to administer that policy have, the Court of Appeals has ruled, illegally refused to discharge their obligations to the great injury of people’s most dire straights and to the public good as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.778" offset="20219028">The beneficiaries of Congress’ providential policy whom we represent appeal to this court to confirm the protections afforded to them by the Court of Appeals by affirming the judgment of the court.</text>
