            <text syncTime="160.262" offset="721031">The New York State legislature enacted the statute here in question which by its terms enabled the non public schools to go into the New York State Court of Claims and to sue in the Court of Claims to collect that second payment for the 71-72 school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.966" offset="799816">At that time, this case which is before this Court today was selected as a test case to be tried in advance and determined in advance of any other cases under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.018" offset="1359986">In this case we were dealing with a federal constitutional question and that was the basis upon which the Court of Claims and the State courts all decide, that was on the basis federal constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.700" offset="1418709">The State Court of Claims held -- agreed with the State's position, granted the motion to dismiss on the basis that the statute was indeed a reenactment even if only for one payment, the statute held unconstitutional by this Court in 1973, and in so doing the Court distinguished this Court's decision in the second Lemon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.158" offset="1524557">Lemon v. Kurtzman, which permitted the final payment under the Pennsylvania statute which had been declared unconstitutional in the first Lemon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.362" offset="1585370">This case however, in the posture which is presented to this Court has one additional issue which arises out of the New York Court of Appeals' decision and I believe it is that decision which brings really the first argument which must be presented to this Court because in scheduling argument in this case, the Court delayed the decision on jurisdiction, pending the oral argument and we have recognized that what we are appealing from here is technically an order of the Court of Appeals which did remand this case to the Court of Claims for an actual trial on the amount of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.535" offset="1762063">We submitted to this Court, and in fact the Appellees here agree that the decision of this Court, that the Court of Appeals decision was final for the purposes of jurisdiction in this Court because it did finally determine the question of constitutionality under the federal constitution of the 1972 Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.717" offset="1846804">But additionally we submit to the Court that the Court of Appeals in its decision, interjected a new element which we consider to be a new element of unconstitutionality into this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.005" offset="1903960">The Court of Appeals in remanding to the Court of Claims, adopted the minority decision in the State Appellate Division, and in that decision the opinion in that, over the minority in that Court, said that the issue of how the funds were actually used by the schools, and whether or not they were used for -- further the religious purpose of the schools, could and should be tried in each claim in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.686" offset="2014719">Now, we should note that under the New York State Constitution, the power to audit and determine claims against the State of New York is given to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.622" offset="2058396">Consequently we feel that the decision of the Court of Appeals interjected into this statute an element which was not present when the underlying 1970 statutes before this Court and that is a question of excessive entanglement between church and state because the auditing function which would be performed by the Court of Claims in the trial of these cases, is significantly similar to the auditing requirement which this Court found to be unconstitutional in the first Lemon decision.</text>

Kurtzman I have thought that the entanglement concept was regarded by the Court as very dubious and was contributed to unconstitutionality because it was a continuing relationship, the continuing entanglement so that it is not the matter of being a little unconstitutional, or wholly unconstitutional when you have one audit as against continuing audit over a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.966" offset="2487849">It is a question of whether one audit creates entanglement, is it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="642.417" offset="2649599">At the time of this statute which is before the Court now was enacted, it was the understanding, I believe of all the parties that including the legislature, that what the legislature was doing, was providing for the Court of Claims to make an award which would be a mathematical computation of the same lump sum amount. But what the Court of Appeals has done in this case, is to provide for an audit by the Court of Claims, an audit which will go into the question of how all of this money was used in the school year to go into the question really of an analysis of the tests, which were given by the teachers involved here and to determine whether or not these services because what would be involved here is the compensation for the teacher-prepared test, whether or not these tests, further the religious function of the schools and we would submit to the Court that, that type of a situation even on a one shot deal would create an excessive entanglement situation between the courts of New York State and the non public schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.513" offset="5809997">The issue here is whether this case is controlled by the rationale of this Court's decision in Lemon II, where the Court balanced in a very flexible way and a very equitable way, constitutional matters as opposed to reliance interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.334" offset="5893276">In this case, the courts below, I am referring to the Court of Claims, I am referring to both the majority and dissenting opinions in the appellate division as adopted by the Court of Appeals found that these schools had relied in terms of planning their budgets which had to be done before the school year begins, on the way so that Cathedral Academy would expect to receive probably about $14,000 per year in two annual installments, and they would act on the basis of their expectation in receipt of that money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.040" offset="6264110">Well, I think the funds that would have been made available really would have gone into the general purposes of the school, would be an additional money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.592" offset="6314265">Well, I think that was raised in the Levitt case, but I think as to that, this Court has never said that simply because a payment is made to a school which enables it to free up all the funds, but that is a violation of the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.123" offset="6372466">This argument was made by the State in its brief and I think we have answered it on that basis with referring to that Robert(ph)case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.427" offset="6389602">That the whole concept of reliance here is really inability to free up funds for general purposes?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard E. Nolan</label>
            <text syncTime="1583.021" offset="6412068">That is right Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.522" offset="6421994">In the Mandated Services Act case, the Levitt case, I think the chronology is fairly significant because the statute was attacked almost immediately, like I think the lawsuits filed either contemporaneously with the statute, or very shortly thereafter?</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.753" offset="6494928">Nothing was done in that case by the plaintiffs, except to move for the convening of the three judge District Court, that motion was opposed by the State, opposed by the intervenors, but was granted by the District Court, that meant that in the District Court's judgment, there was a substantial federal constitutional question which required the convening of a three judge District Court under the statutes then in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.298" offset="6601090">Then, the case remain acquired for at least another year until 1972 and I think the reason for that was because this Court had before the Lemon I case, and the Tilton case and putting aside the general question as to the precision with which people can predict the outcome of First Amendment Church-State cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.101" offset="6700355">There was a great deal of question in everybody's mind as to what effect the Lemon and Tilton cases would have on the Mandated Services Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.883" offset="6735464">It was not until 1972, in March of 1972, that the three judge court called for briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.970" offset="6787813">There was never an application for a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.403" offset="6809547">The case simply remained at rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.424" offset="6817593">I believe there came a point where the plaintiffs wrote to Chief Judge Kaufman and asked him to expedite the matter Chief Judge Kaufman pointed the three judge court in March, they called for briefs, the case was argued in early April.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.487" offset="6877883">It was argued about three or four days before the first payments for the second semester would have been made between the period of April 15 and June 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.978" offset="6915813">The Court heard argument and entered a temporary restraining order until its decision which came down in the later part of April.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.370" offset="6945384">That decision was not unanimous, it was a very very vigorous dissent by Judge Palmieri.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.522" offset="6970043">Then the case came up here, but in the meantime and before Lemon II had been decided, the New York legislature recognizing the problems which the District Court's decision, or the timing of the District Court's decision had coursed to these schools, passed chapter 996.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.115" offset="7052381">Now, the case came up here and this Court well knows, the Court took probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.309" offset="7077145">Obviously there had to be something to argue about, the case was then fully argued and briefed and it was decided that the Mandated Services Act was unconstitutional with one justice dissenting, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.033" offset="7128032">So I think to say as Ms. Coon now does that the schools could not have reasonably relied on receipt of this money, at least up until the time of a final determination as to constitutionality, I must say, I do not think that is correct and certainly does not comport with this Court's decision in Lemon II which recognized the very very shadowing line of demarcation between what is valid and what is invalid in the Church-State cases and which also recognized the fact that there is a a presumption of constitutionality under which state officials, private parties are entitled to act, and entitled to rely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.282" offset="7377031">In other words, those would have been paid had the District Court's decision not come down when it did, those moneys would have been paid between April 15 and June 15 of 1972.</text>

            <text syncTime="1884.737" offset="7618925">So that we are talking about not $14 million, but something reasonably close to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.780" offset="7639091">Now, one of the attempt to distinctions that the state makes respect to Lemon, is that in Lemon there was an audit procedure under the statute which audit procedure had been completed except the certain administrative details by the time, the case was concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.767" offset="7731042">In this case the statute, the Mandated Services Act did not have an audit procedure, and that was one of the problems that we had with it, it provided for a lump sum payment and that is what one of the things this Court found to be defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.252" offset="7796975">In chapter 996, what the legislature has attempted to do, is to give to the Court of Claims, jurisdiction to hear claims against the State for reimbursement of mandated services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.841" offset="7863326">The State claims that this is going to create an entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.910" offset="7883597">First of all, it is a one time reimbursement and it cannot occur again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.787" offset="7903033">The statute on its face applies only to whatever portion of the second half of the 1971-72 funds are found by the Court of Claims to be reimbursable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.219" offset="7948799">Secondly, we do not have here a situation such as in the ordinary entanglement situation, of the administrative officers of the State government in New York's case the State Education Department, coming into the schools and in effect, telling the schools what to do or interfering with the school's operations whatever they may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.380" offset="8029465">What we have here is a judicial proceeding in the Court of Claims, which handles all money damage cases against the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.432" offset="8065619">We have a situation here where a claimant just as a construction claimant or anybody who is a contract fight with the State of New York, that will come in and will attempt to prove what it was, that what services he performed that he is entitled to recover against the State on, either on a theory of contract, or on a theory of statutory authorization or queries like contract or one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.928" offset="8199679">I think that to what -- that is yes, but I think that that can be handled under the procedures that have been set up as indicated in the opinion of Presiding Justice Hurley here, the Appellate Division which opinion was later adopted as a majority opinion by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.915" offset="8267597">I think so far as attendance records, health records, the costs provided in the State standardized region's examination, pupil evaluation, performance examinations and like, there should not be any problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.620" offset="8334366">What -- where the problem arises as Mr. Justice Marshall rightly points out, is in making sure that no reimbursement will occur for examinations in or examinations which tend to propagate religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.835" offset="8411271">Presiding Justice Hurley stated; however, it is readily apparent that it was never the intent of the legislature that any of its funds would have been allowed for the furtherance of religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.976" offset="8451813">In this regard, the audit by the Court of Claims must serve the same purpose as the final post audit which was referred to in Lemon II.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.419" offset="8481593">Accordingly, the burden will be on the claimant to prove that the items of its claim are in fact solely for mandated services, and the burden will be upon the Court of Claims to make appropriate findings in regard thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.947" offset="8527673">So I think the Court of Claims is going to have if claims are made or reimbursement of teacher-prepared examinations, we will have to take evidence as to what those examinations consisted other than satisfy itself, it can do so, or the claimants can carry their burden of proof that this was not a method of propagating religion.</text>

What examinations were given in history, to what extent was religious matters covered by those, to what extent were they not and a determination made as to whether and to what to extent money damages are to be awarded? I do not think that has any propensity at all for moving the State into a position where it would affecting the ongoing operations of the schools or creating any sort of administrative interplay between the present operations of the schools and the State and I think that the entanglement on argument whatever its merits maybe in an ongoing program where moneys are to be made available year after, year after, year and will have to be audits, periodical audits to make sure as in Lemon that there would be no use of this money for religion, that's a totally different thing I think from the one time limited reimbursement that we are talking about here.</text>
