            <text syncTime="56.122" offset="304439">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.779" offset="319068">This is an Internal Revenue summons enforcement proceeding in which the District Court denied enforcement and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.548" offset="358147">The case presents questions that many of us thought were settled by this Court’s decisions in United States v. Powell in 1964 and Donaldson v. the United States in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.858" offset="419378">But, the questions have stubbornly persisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.221" offset="436828">The special agent in this case served a summons on the respondents, a bank and its vice-president, seeking information involving real estate trust relating to the affairs of a particular taxpayer who was the subject of his investigation and incidentally, the record shows that the taxpayer’s attorney has been the counsel for the respondents throughout the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.241" offset="592935">The special agent’s testimony, in response to the purpose of the issuance of the summons and in direct response to questions, said that the purpose of his investigation was to determine tax liabilities for the years under investigation and when asked what the focus of his own inquiry into the matter was, he said it was to investigate the possibility of criminal violations of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.821" offset="735251">The Court of Appeals characterized this testimony as indicating that the record establish that the special agent testified to the existence of a civil purpose, but that the District Court who observed the demeanor of the witness discredited that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.944" offset="855727">Now, while it is not material to the position that we are taking in the case, I do think it is illustrative of the problems we are running into in these cases that with all respect, I find it hard myself to characterize the holding of the District Court this way, but there was no contradictory testimony of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.357" offset="981324">The District Court was relying in its findings solely on the testimony of the agent with respect to the functions that he was carrying out.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.347" offset="1025314">The findings recited by the District Court, seem to me, to be wholly consistent with the agent’s testimony and that is in the Appendix to the petition referring to the District Court’s opinion at the bottom of page 2A of the Appendix to the petition and the top of page 3A, the District Court said it is apparent, however, that this focus and determination, namely that it is an investigation for a criminal purpose, maybe arrived at under certain circumstances before the actual recommendation for criminal prosecution has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.468" offset="1197827">In such event, the focus and determination has been arrived at the time of the issuance of the Internal Revenue summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.413" offset="1233562">In the District Court’s view, that becomes a summons issued for an improper purpose that should not be enforced and that was reflected by the testimony where the agent said “While the purpose of his investigation was to determine tax liabilities, the focus of his inquiry all consistent with the language used by the District Court was to investigate whether there had been a criminal violation of the tax laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="315.989" offset="1343904">The difficulty that we are finding in the summons enforcement proceedings --</text>

            <text syncTime="350.382" offset="1481517">Well, to the extent that the witness said it was for some other purpose when the District Court says it is solely for the purpose of criminal proceedings --</text>

            <text syncTime="357.128" offset="1508475">That is the test being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.216" offset="1516834">I recognize that one can characterize this is the way the Court of Appeals characterized it, but I find it difficult to find inconsistency between Judge McGarr’s holding and the testimony and he does not in any way reject the testimony, he seems to be saying that so long as the agent admits that the focus of his inquiry is on the criminal aspects of the investigation, that shows that there is a solely criminal purpose for purposes of applying the standard that he thinks should be applied under Donaldson.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.647" offset="1658522">How do you expect us to decide the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="396.271" offset="1665001">Should we assume that the investigation was solely for criminal purposes or not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="401.766" offset="1687048">That is what I am trying to get to, if you will let me do it a little bit indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.384" offset="1729471">In the first place, I do not think it is the pertinent question and in the second place there is no such investigation when an assignment has been made to a special agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.162" offset="1768550">That is the short answer, but I will have to explain it a little bit indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.789" offset="1787149">The difficulty that we are running into in the summons enforcement proceedings in a number of Courts of Appeals that have departed from the line of demarcation that was at least one line clearly established in Donaldson whether a recommendation has been made to the Department of Justice and that, it instead adapted a standard of whether the sole purpose was a criminal purpose or whether the agent had a firm purpose to recommend prosecution or a fixed purpose to recommend prosecution is that the inquiry is focusing on the personal purpose of the agent and his subjective understanding of his assignment rather than the legal purpose of the authorized investigation that has been assigned to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.435" offset="1993726">An agent does not select the subject of his investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.803" offset="2015146">In this case, he said he was assigned to investigate the tax liabilities of this particular taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.397" offset="2049523">That assignment was duly made by who would have been the group manager in a large office such as this one, in a smaller office, it would be made by the chief of the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.809" offset="2095185">Our position is that so long as that assignment is duly made as a tax investigation assignment and the agent is carrying out that investigation, there is no meaningful distinction in the agent’s functions between a civil and criminal purpose of his investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.862" offset="2199362">The two are not separable and the delay that we are running into in summons enforcement proceedings is because the agents are being called to the stand and cross examined about their personal understanding of their function to see if, in some way, they will indicate sometimes through an appeal to their vanity about the kind of matters that call for bringing them into it, that, this was really an investigation of criminal conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.184" offset="2332691">Mr. Wallace, we do have a case here involving a particular agent and a particular investigation and Justice Stevens asked you awhile ago about whether in view of Judge McGarr’s finding that the investigation was solely for criminal purposes, which he suggested the Court of Appeals had upheld is not clearly erroneous, what hypothesis do we go ahead on this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="587.012" offset="2427985">The people of the Organization of the IRS, I do not think, are very helpful to answer that.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.237" offset="2456929">I think it makes all of the difference because both the District Court and the Court of Appeals proceeded on the erroneous premise that the test here, and I am referring back to Judge McGarr’s opinion at page 2A of the Appendix to the petition, this was the next thing I was getting to, he said in the first full paragraph on that page, the court recognizes that civil and criminal investigations may go forward side-by-side before a determination of the ultimate focus of the investigation is made and that is quoted virtually word-for-word by the Court of Appeals on page 8A in a apparent agreement that that is the starting point of the legal analysis here, but it is not --</text>

            <text syncTime="654.188" offset="2696733">What I am trying to tell the Court is that there is no such thing as a civil and criminal investigation going on side-by-side in the way the Internal Revenue Service proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.701" offset="2746784">It really is a matter of nomenclature whether you say that the special agent’s assignment is to determine whether fraud penalties should be assessed against the taxpayer or whether there has been criminal violations of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="685.038" offset="2820135">Would this Court not be as free as the Court of Appeals’ would have been to say that absent contrary testimony or some affirmative testimony finding by District Judge, his finding on this subject was clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.319" offset="2881262">Is that not one of the alternatives open?</text>

            <text syncTime="703.006" offset="2891920">It is an alternative open, but I think this is not a matter of the clearly erroneous finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.235" offset="2920864">This is a matter of an improper legal standard being applied to the question of the enforceability of an Internal Revenue Summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.636" offset="2954509">I think that this is clarified, very helpfully, for us by a recent analysis by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which have set out in the Appendix to our reply brief in an opinion written by Judge Friendly on behalf of that court in a case called United States v. Morgan Guaranty Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.477" offset="3057850">As he points out at the bottom of page 12A of the Appendix to our reply brief we start and I think this is quite accurate, from the premise that investigations of taxpayers that would develop evidence of criminal, but not of civil tax liability must be rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.857" offset="3139352">Indeed, petitioners have pointed to none.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.549" offset="3150114">As we specify in our brief, when tax fraud is found, that is evidence that supports a determination that a 50% fraud penalty should be added to the liability otherwise due and the Internal Revenue Code is quite specific that that kind of a fraud penalty is a tax within the meaning of the Code, that is Section 6659 (a) (2) of the Code and that a determination that a fraud penalty is owing is part of what must be specified in the statutory notice of deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.209" offset="3344779">That is the effect of Section 6671 of the Code and it is the statutory notice of deficiency that culminates from a tax investigation undertaken by the special agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.808" offset="3799205">There are revenue agents and special agents who specialize in different aspects of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.504" offset="3825954">The revenue agent, all this was recognized in the court’s Donaldson opinion when it said that the mere bringing in of the special agent is not converted into an improper use of the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.877" offset="3867437">The revenue agent is a specialist in determining liability other than the 50% addition to tax, that is the fraud penalty and a special agent is someone trained to investigate for fraud and to see whether a 50% addition to the tax liability should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.580" offset="3942251">In other words, he has 1/3 of the responsibility for determining the possible deficiency in the tax payment and that is specifically what Section 7602 of the Code authorizes agents of the service to issue summons for, to determine tax liability, which I just explained to the Court, includes in the definitions of the Code, liability for a fraud penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.095" offset="4332312">No, I agree with the position, but it has to be understood in the context of two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.308" offset="4365226">One is statistics that we have cited in our brief on page 20 that show that very substantial sums of fraud penalties are assessed as a result of these investigations in cases in which no recommendation for criminal prosecution is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.151" offset="4444534">It is very difficult to anticipate which of these investigations will fall into that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.769" offset="4463028">The second point, and a point I think is very well-made, again in Judge Friendly’s opinion for the Second Circuit, again on Page 12A, is that it is not up to the special agent to decide whether a case will be referred for criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.854" offset="4567309">He does not have the authority to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.092" offset="4576295">He is not the responsible official to decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.299" offset="4597089">We are cross-examining these special agents about whether they have a firm purpose to recommend criminal prosecution, but that is not the same thing as a determination that in all but form a recommendation of criminal prosecution will be transmitted to the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.772" offset="4671068">The agent in determining, after his investigation is concluded, whether to recommend prosecution consults with his group manager whose recommendation will go along with his, either agreeing or disagreeing with it and I am told that in a substantial percentage of the cases, the group manager’s greater experience in discussing the case with the special agent will change the special agent’s mind about whether to recommend criminal prosecution in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.742" offset="4822891">We do not have figures on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.463" offset="4829788">The Internal Revenue Service does not have figures on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.410" offset="4841595">After that takes place, if the agent’s conclusion to recommend criminal prosecution survives that, it then goes to the Chief of the Intelligence Division’s District Office who has the authority to put an end to it right there if he disagrees with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.033" offset="4928113">That is a relatively small percentage of cases that get that far and then he puts an end to it, but there are cases where he puts an end to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.740" offset="4970953">If he decides to carry it forward, he does not have the authority to transmit it to the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.160" offset="5000628">His only authority is to send it to the Regional Counsel with a recommendation that it be transmitted to the Department of Justice with the recommendation for criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.122" offset="5052455">The Regional Counsel, we do have figures on and those figures show that in Fiscal Year 1976, the Regional Counsel declined to refer 14.6% of the cases that reach that far over to the Department of Justice, 349 he declined and 2,037 he did refer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.060" offset="5176171">In 1977, the percentage was 10.9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.293" offset="5197069">Now, the question necessarily arises what of the cases in which the agent had a firm purpose to recommend criminal prosecution, but the evidence that he had at that time that his purpose became fixed was not sufficient to persuade his superiors to recommend criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.787" offset="5295081">What investigatory tool is available under the statutory scheme for such cases under the holdings of the Courts of Appeals that say that the agent’s purpose is what is controlling as to whether the summons is available?</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.130" offset="5344504">The summons is the only investigatory tool that the agent has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.190" offset="5360700">Other than that, all he can do is present his credentials and ask for voluntary disclosures of information which banks and other employers and other institutions are increasingly reluctant to make because they are afraid of being sued if they do not have compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.044" offset="5440113">There is no compulsory process available to the agent except the Internal Revenue summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.409" offset="5465608">If the agent has a firm purpose in mind, several Circuits have held he cannot use that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.973" offset="5491835">That leaves nothing available but a grand jury subpoena.</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.467" offset="10281856">The Court I think correctly stated that the mere fact that these may be the duties does not inextricably lead to a criminal prosecution and the Court did not want to deny the Internal Revenue Service because of these provisions the right to issue summonses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.520" offset="10342042">Neither did the District Court or the Court of Appeals in this case, the finding is wholly consistent with the finding in Donaldson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.844" offset="10367329">The finding in this case is not merely that the agent was going ahead with a legitimate investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.760" offset="10390944">The point of the findings below was that this was not a legitimate investigation in furtherance of any statutory duty or any statutory right that this agent may have had pursuant to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.651" offset="10446532">If judicial review is to have any viability in the summons cases, the mere fact that the tax payers or people summonsed may exercise their right to judicial review does not mean that judicial review somehow becomes something disrespectful of the processes or something that a taxpayer or a person summoned should not avail themselves of.</text>

            <text syncTime="2622.057" offset="10568158">The mechanical application that the petitioners urge upon the Court will do nothing to stop these abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.136" offset="10596475">If the only rule is merely that an agent has not recommend it to his superiors and his superiors to the Department of Justice, that criminal prosecution be recommended and instituted, the only thing that a special agent need do is hold off on that recommendation as they do now until the criminal case is completed then turn it over, once again have it reviewed by Regional Counsel to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a prosecution and turn it over to the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.166" offset="10720609">There is nothing magical about that recommendation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3392.596" offset="13650294">I think, in addition, the type of records that are being summonsed here would contraindicate any tax purpose to the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.746" offset="13686970">The records that are peculiar to an Illinois Land Trust are not necessarily those which would be relevant to an inquiry of a person’s tax return or whether a person who has committed a crime with respect to that tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.021" offset="13735975">As we point out in our brief, the records of an Illinois Land Trust basically consist of the trust agreement which is a standard form and is standard in all banks in Illinois and the letters of direction either to take title, issue or sign a mortgage and those kinds of things, not necessarily relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.675" offset="13818627">There is no basis in this case for counsel’s suggestion that the finding was that there was a criminal investigation here that may be unrelated to tax liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.927" offset="13867633">The Court of Appeals specifically says on page 5A of the Appendix to the petition, Special Agent Olivero was conducting an investigation of the federal tax liabilities of John Gattuso and the District Court says respondents contend that Special Agent Olivero was in fact conducting an investigation of criminal violations of the Internal Revenue Code by John Gattuso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.261" offset="13965017">The Miller case, which has been referred to, involved an attempt to challenge a grand jury subpoena rather than an Internal Revenue summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.808" offset="14007126">It may be rare, but it was an instance of the use of a grand jury subpoena in a tax investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.453" offset="14033771">As it has been pointed out, the procedural protections available to the taxpayer in an Internal Revenue summons situation in many ways compare favorably to those available in the grand jury subpoena situation, especially with the enactment of Section 7609 of the Code which allows intervention in the third-party summons proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.023" offset="14136067">Obviously the indictment, if there is to be one, has to be returned by the grand jury and evidence developed in civil investigations as the Court indicated in United States v. Kordel in the course of a Food and Drug Administration question raising the same issue, evidence developed in civil investigations legitimately can later be presented to a grand jury and is pertinent to a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.046" offset="14240139">The one suggestion made on page 12A of the Appendix to the reply brief by Judge Friendly of the possibility of the willfully false statement having nothing to do with liability is not something that ordinarily could be anticipated at the time the special agent commences his investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.014" offset="14324044">Ordinarily, the willfully false statement that a tax investigation would be concerned with is concealment of the source of income which is a common way of concealing deficiencies and whether a prosecution should later be brought even though it turns out that no additional liability is involved, it is not something that can be determined at the outset in deciding whether to follow up an investigation to see whether the source of income has been concealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.286" offset="14445043">It cannot be known at that point whether that will indicate in the particular case that there is additional tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.482" offset="14477853">Finally, I wanted to say that what we are faced with here is a situation in which the cases that suggest the most serious problems of fraud where the special agent may think this is likely to be a case, where a criminal recommendation will eventuate, are the cases where there are difficulties in getting the summonses enforced in pursuing the investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.047" offset="14576178">Whereas, the more marginal cases that the special agents are involved in where they may not have much of a notion at the beginning that this is likely to show a serious fraud are the ones where there is no basis for saying that they have a firm purpose that they are going to recommend a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.965" offset="14643783">We are finding that the sole investigatory tool of the Internal Revenue Service is being denied early on in the investigations in the more serious cases leaving us with only the alternative of presenting unright investigatory files to the US Attorneys and to clutter up grand jury proceedings where many of them would be weeded out in the normal course of the Internal Revenue investigations after the evidence is developed and reviewed by superiors is made.</text>
