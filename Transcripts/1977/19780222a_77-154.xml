            <label>Mr. David H. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="41.561" offset="166243">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.858" offset="179409">In the case now before you, the petitioner, the President of the University of Maryland, urges this Court to preserve the rational system of assigning tuition to students that prevails at most public colleges in universities across the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.070" offset="248268">Following the 1973 decision of this Court in Vlandis against Kline, public institutions of higher education adopted new policies for determining students' admission, tuition rates, and other charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.728" offset="302811">The policy is adopted by the University of Maryland and most other publicly supported schools look not only to the domicile of the students in granting preferential in-state status, but also are predicated on a number of legitimate grounds for according differential consideration in defining who is entitled to the benefit of lower fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.642" offset="398524">Thus, while the policy of the University of Maryland generally looks to who is financially responsible for bearing a student's education on other cost and then looks to the domicile that person whether it be the student, his parent, or spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.617" offset="470413">In order to accommodate the legitimate and preserved by the policy, it recognizes that variations from the general applications are both necessary and appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.100" offset="512313">For example, both resident students and permanent resident aliens can and do qualify for in-state status at the University of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.437" offset="549721">By contrast, nonresident citizens and nonimmigrant aliens are denied preferential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.690" offset="578664">Similarly, the University's policy denies its benefits to a group of citizens whose association with and contributions to the state are likely to the minimal and transitory, specifically to those members of the Armed Forces who come to the University not by choice but by assignment for educational purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.329" offset="669257">In May 1975, respondents, three undergraduate students at the University of Maryland, filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United State District Court for the District of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.532" offset="718054">Each was financially dependent on his father, an employee of an International Bank in Washington D.C. who held as did his child a nonimmigrant G-4 visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.942" offset="763716">G-4 nonimmigrant visas are given to officers or employees of international organizations and the members of their immediate families.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.077" offset="800287">As one seeking to be a nonimmigrant alien, a person applying for a G-4 visa must state under oath the purpose and length of his intended stay in the United States can be admitted only for such time and under such conditions as the Attorney General made by regulations prescribed, and is required by the applicable regulations to agree to abide by all the terms and conditions of his admission and to depart at the expiration of the period of his admission for the abandonment of his authorized nonimmigrant status.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.225" offset="936856">Such nonimmigrants are decisively disqualified by federal law from establishing a permanent residence in this country because the Immigration and Naturalization Act accords a privilege of residing permanently in the United States, only to aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.760" offset="1010939">In the District Court, represented by Council retained by the International Banks for which their fathers worked, respondents urged that the University's policy of denying in-state status to the holders of G-4 nonimmigrant visas where those financially dependent on the holders such visas.</text>

            <label>Mr. David H. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="293.392" offset="1173525">Well, if the Court please, I think it was -- has been suggested both by the Court's majority opinion in Nyquist against Mauclet last term and particularly by Mr. Justice Rehnquist's dissent in that case that aliens who are nonimmigrants are under a disability from being domiciled in this country or at least most categories of aliens who are nonimmigrants and for that matter that is a factor which is conceded by the respondents in this case as I'll connote later during the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.582" offset="1326289">Respondents urged in the District Court that the University's policy of denying in-state status to them violated the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.950" offset="1371742">The District Court held in July 1976, that the University's policy as applied to G-4 nonimmigrant visa holders, created a permanent irrebuttable presumption of nondomicile in violation of the Due Process Clause and thus the District Court did not reach the equal protection claim now reasserted here by the respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.343" offset="3549309">And first, I might note that it is the general policy which is described there, not only the focused sole reason for what the policy is.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.751" offset="3602913">But in that regard, I would refer the Court to paragraph 1 subsection d, which in a list of classes to which in-state status is accorded indicates that such status is available where a student who is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States is stationed on act of duty in Maryland for at least six consecutive months immediately prior to the last day available for registration for the forthcoming semester, unless such student has been assigned for educational purposes to attend the University of Maryland.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.644" offset="4038531">But the basis with respect to nonimmigrant aliens is as to those who are -- for example, on student visas or on other transitory states in the United States that their relationship to the State and their liability for the full payment of state taxes, if any, will be fleeting at most, so that in the long run, their contribution to the University will not be particularly great.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.903" offset="4159530">In the case of G-4 nonimmigrant visa holders and diplomats, for example, who would be a similar category such persons are under no liability to pay federal or state income taxation, and because of their non-liability for payment of the full spectrum of taxes, their contributions to the university in the long run would be minimal as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.466" offset="4885838">As this Court indicated last term Califano versus Jobst state classifications are not gauged properly by focusing on selected atypical examples of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.826" offset="4943203">Starting with Weinberger versus Salfi in 1975, two years before, a long and unbroken line of this Court's decisions makes clear that state classifications not affecting fundamental rights do not create unconstitutional irrebuttable presumptions or otherwise violates Due Process Clause if rationally related to legitimate governmental objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.974" offset="5031811">Obviously, a claim of a preferred tuition rate, whether or not the excess is paid by parent's International Bank employer, does not involve a basic human liberty or a fundamental constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.454" offset="5085727">And thus, many legitimate grounds proffered by petitioner in this case are more than sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.023" offset="5108088">Before discussing this rationale basis, perhaps a word or two should be said about Salfi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.285" offset="5133061">Salfi involved an irrebuttable presumption in the Social Security Act which effectively held marriages lasting less than nine months to be shams and denied benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.139" offset="5180500">Absent from the Court's opinion was any language of strict scrutiny or at least restrictive alternative and the focus was upon Starns versus Malkerson where the Court said, what we believe should be restated in this case, “The benefits here are available upon compliance with an objective criterion, one which the legislature considered to bare a sufficiently close nexus with underlying policy objectives to be used as a test for eligibility.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.998" offset="5287915">Like the plaintiff in Starns, appellees are completely free to present evidence that they need to specific requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.341" offset="5313306">Feeling in this effort, their only constitutional claim is that the test they cannot meet is not so rationally related to a legitimate legislative objective that it can be used to deprive them of benefits available to those who do satisfied the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.696" offset="5378717">And in the Usery versus Turner case, a year later, the Court indicated that whether or not a classification stated an irrebuttable presumption on its base was irrelevant when its operation and the fact were completely permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.060" offset="5444232">Similarly in Califano versus Jobst and the Massachusetts Board of Retirement versus Murgia cases of last year and the year before, the Court sustained what we were obvious facial or otherwise irrebuttable presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.400" offset="5493551">Despite the fact that in Murgia, an administrative device existed but was not used and annual physical examination to inquire into the factual matter that was presumed namely that policeman were unfit to serve at age 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.355" offset="5549349">Just how little is left of the irrebuttable presumption doctrine was made clear by Mr. Justice Blackmun's opinion for unanimous Court in Ohio Bureau of Employment Services versus Hodory from the last term, a case not cited in any of the briefs before this Court in this case but one which we now believe to be particularly relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.157" offset="5624581">There are three-judge Court and had invalidated on equal protection and due process ground, and Ohio statute denying an employment compensation other than because of a lockout of an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.996" offset="5667944">In reversing the District Court, this Court noted that legitimate interest of the State in preserving the integrity of its fund and dismissed the irrebuttable presumption claim on a footnote stating, “This argument requires several assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.083" offset="5724264">First, appellee must assume that the purpose of the statute is to measure innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.268" offset="5740983">Then, he must assume that the disqualification provision represents a presumption that any person laid off due to a strike is not innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.530" offset="5770031">If the statute is designed to serve any purpose other than measuring innocence, appellee's implication of an irrebuttable presumption fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.464" offset="5801796">As we discussed below, the statute clearly has purposes other than measuring the innocence of the disqualified worker.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.984" offset="5831889">Similarly, the policies of the University of Maryland and at most other public institutions or prior education which deny in-state status to nonimmigrant aliens have a number of purposes other than the measure of domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.086" offset="5880268">These policies effect a recent decision to equalize the cost of college and university training between those with continuing liability to support public higher education by paying the full spectrums of state taxes and those such as nonimmigrant employees of the International Banks who do not have that obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.896" offset="5963546">Tuition payments at public institutions of higher education represent only a portion of a true cost and the amount available for state subsidized educational benefit is not limitless.</text>
