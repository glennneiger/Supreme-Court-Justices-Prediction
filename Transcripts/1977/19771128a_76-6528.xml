            <label>Mr. Bart C. Durham, III</label>
            <text syncTime="50.286" offset="281127">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.642" offset="294502">This case rose in Nashville, Tennessee, it is a bank robbery, which occurred there some two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.887" offset="323445">The defendant at his arraignment imposed to plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.297" offset="353120">At that time in the Sixth Circuit, we were operating under the Smith rule which we presently are today and known as Smith I, a case that cited in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.493" offset="405888">The defendant as I say entered the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and on motion of the Government he was ordered to be examined for mental competency.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.750" offset="446952">The order of the District Court which required him to be examined, set out the three rules which the Sixth Circuit chooses ALRU basically requires and ordered the physician to report to the Court and the United States Attorney the answers to those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.469" offset="541829">Trial came on sometime later and the issue was contested on the facts at the trial, but of the trial transcript on those bulk of it -- not probably the bulk -- is consumed with really the only defense and that is insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.545" offset="622077">The United States used a psychiatrist and a psychologist as their witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.075" offset="648200">They also used laypersons in the bank and a cabdriver who was kidnapped just before the robbery for few moments and as I said they used the laywitnesses in the bank and they used the FBI agents who apprehended him just a few moments and took after the bank robbery and made the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.502" offset="733986">The defendant used his experts, the family of the defendant, who testified the bizarre, erratic and unusual behavior and three medical witnesses, two highly qualified psychiatrists, one of whom had been used, Dr. Mandan (ph), who had been used many times by the United States as their choice to examine potential defendants in imposing insanity offenses.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="195.925" offset="863657">Are you suggesting that we can inquire into or try to reevaluate the qualifications of the witnesses?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bart_c_durham_iii" startTime="204.574" stopTime="364.067">
            <label>Mr. Bart C. Durham, III</label>
            <text syncTime="204.574" offset="898244">No sir, my point is just saying there were five medical experts witnesses and it was extensively presented to the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.110" offset="940353">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit looked into that matter and they reversed the case under the authority of 28 U.S.C. 2106 federal statute, which empowers this Court and the Court of Appeals to enter such orders as are just are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.893" offset="1019556">The Sixth Circuit, in my thinking, made a finding of fact that the Government did not make a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.048" offset="1052157">Counsel for the United States has raised the question of whether -- raised by the members of the Court few minutes earlier as to whether the Government made a prima facie case or to what extent one might read that opinion in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.858" offset="1119344">But in any event they found that because of insufficient evidence the case should be remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.195" offset="1144735">The Sixth Circuit cited the Bryan rule which has been discussed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.542" offset="1166051">As Your Honors know and as I have set out, there was no criminal appeal except in extraordinary cases until 1890 something and then I believe only in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.990" offset="1211922">In 1896 the Ball rule came forth, which was an attack on double jeopardy and it is a lien case in that, and that set forth the rule of waiver, in which it was said that sometimes someone who got a new trial was either starting on a clean slide or that there was continuing jeopardy or that by asking for a new trial he had waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.888" offset="1315471">And much of the my brief is taken up with regarding the waiver rationale in light of this Court’s later opinions and particularity in light of the Green decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.539" offset="1370120">I believe the Solicitor General’s brief, a fair reading of that, is that he pretty much agrees with me that waiver is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.200" offset="1408781">With respect to waiver where one specifically asks for a new trial as well as a judgment of acquittal, which was a question asked sometime ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.832" offset="1455279">I would only say that any defendant would rather have an acquittal rather than a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.008" offset="1487984">If that is the only choice with which he has faced then it is no choice at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.940" offset="1507733">Whereas in this case, we asked the District Judge both for a new trial -- we filed motion for a new trial alleging other errors.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.308" offset="1557156">A new trial and a judgment of conviction - that is the one which defendant might on appropriate occasions prefer a judgment of conviction in light of Jackson v. StemClone (ph) and some of the cases this Court has decided that he might get more time on the second.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.747" offset="1666871">Your motion for judgment of acquittal is denied, your motion for new trial it is granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.785" offset="1875119">Well, it is one of the exceptions that, and I do not think one brings, one must bring oneself within the exceptions and I do not think that one properly has in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.057" offset="1932170">Bryan versus United States was what I believed to be the first considered opinion that was decided in 1950 by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.215" offset="1968742">As I pointed out, it was a 12 paragraph decision, it was decided a few months or within a short time after the new Rules of Federal Criminal Procedure were adapted, and it was primarily concerned in my judgment with the application of the rules involved the District Court reasonably the power of the Court of Appeals, and the Court did have language in there and did say in the final paragraph that it does not violate the double jeopardy provision of the United States Constitution to retry on me in the second time for insufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.314" offset="2117222">Subsequent to 1950 in the Bryan case it has been the subject of nothing but uncomplimentary articles both in the courts, discussions in the courts and in the law review articles to the fact that Bryan was wrongly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.046" offset="2192141">If I read the brief of the United States fairly, I believe that they are willing to give a great deal on Bryan although they are not of course willing to give all.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.628" offset="2238430">In fact, if I read the brief fairly for the United States, you can almost make their argument that they are willing to give this case, but they wish to urge to the Court that it would not be the Bryan overruling such be the case and not to be extended to all cases where the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.088" offset="2344278">The reasons advanced for double jeopardy occurring where the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict have been numerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.989" offset="2383880">Since 1950, I think we have seen an increase in decisions on double jeopardy, double jeopardy is a hierarchy of rights, it has taken a strong position.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.112" offset="2440408">Some of the reasons for which I would urge on the Court why this distinction should be allowed would be as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.004" offset="2483981">Before I get to that let me point out that difference between reversal for procedural errors and reversals for insufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.945" offset="2523687">Where the case is reversed for procedural error, the defendant did not get the trial of which he was entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.959" offset="2555765">The prosecutor made some remark that was wrong, a statement that was introduced against him which was not reliably probative or some other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.814" offset="2595158">So we have a great -- here to for as it seems to me unrecognized quantum difference between a reversal for procedural error, such as even in Bryan, where the two cases it cited involved those type of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.255" offset="2844993">Yes sir, in one category I think we put all errors involving insufficiency of the evidence, and in box B we put everything else, and I think it is readily as tenable, the quantum as I have said difference between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.444" offset="2921688">Now, as I said this Court has never given as far as I know plenary consideration or even discussed that difference until today.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.856" offset="2971321">Now, some of the arguments in favor of granting acquittals after insufficient evidence that have to do with the disparity of treatment which the same defendant might receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.092" offset="3024297">For example, other Trial Courts -- let us assume that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.996" offset="3059928">Trial Court A might affirm as we have heard here in the case of Florida, and other judge might grant a new trial on the same proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.946" offset="3107680">Also other appellate courts, two different panels of appellate courts might grant acquittals.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.721" offset="3134848">And the Sixth Circuit in a case I have cited in my brief, Rosenberger, the Court of Appeals, one panel sent the case back a few years ago for -- ordered a judgment of acquittal, and the present case before you today, they sent it back for a new trial and then you have different standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.189" offset="3204647">The case was sent back today under a Fifth Circuit standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.161" offset="3224604">In other instances, the standard has been rather most is just an appropriate sometimes if like in the Willey (ph) case or some of the other cases I mentioned, they have been sent back as to whether or not the prosecution was unfairly prevented from bringing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.382" offset="3281447">So one has -- people being, cases either being sent back or not sent back and those that are sent back then we have different standards for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.327" offset="3325228">So we almost have a lawless, as Mr. Justice Stevens pointed out, questions suggested to me as we have a lawless system of appellate review we are standardless.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.250" offset="3384892">Furthermore, there is an argument that the idea of allowing the Government two bytes of the apple in instances of insufficient evidence condones and perpetuates careless prosecutorial trial and preparation, and I believe a fair reading of the record would show that that is true in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.531" offset="3470051">In this instance, it seems egregious.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.458" offset="3481754">Number one, there was a plea of not guilty “by reason of insanity” and orally in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.068" offset="3520206">So that would vested arraignment what it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.585" offset="3530237">Number two, the judge’s order to determine competency set out the three rules of Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.752" offset="3554897">Number three, the defensive trial of course had raised an issue of insanity first and they asked every witness, they went right down the Smith Rule in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.885" offset="3603484">Furthermore, the record shows that we had large charts in which we asked each witness, what is your answer to question one, question two and question three.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.160" offset="3644549">And lastly the Court in its charge to the jury followed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.005" offset="3663984">Smith case, as I said, was decided in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.690" offset="3678717">Smith II which went in to an amplified Smith I, which was the same defendant back on a retrial, subsequent appeal after retrial, went into the question of the quantum of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.724" offset="3726782">What was the evidentiary value of laywitnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.906" offset="3747576">I think that this is an instance and we are not suggesting that the prosecutor has to bam, bam, bam one, two three ask the ALI (ph) questions both Smith and now circuit questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.042" offset="3796059">But he has got to some way elicit to ultimate facts of that and now he failed to do that, he used the type of witnesses who the Sixth Circuit had already told him, did not have proper credentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.727" offset="3862828">In that 1970 opinion, they said, someone who just sees the crime for few minutes and described the witnesses that the Government used that those type of people do not have sufficient knowledge for the trier of fact to reach the ultimate issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.395" offset="3941509">Now society, of course, should fear and the Tateo and the Wilson case decided a term or two ago by this Court, urge a balancing of the equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.455" offset="3985708">But that is not the instance in the insufficient evidence cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.928" offset="4003680">Society should fear the release of a defendant acquitted on the procedural error, because we make a judgment there that it is better perhaps to uphold the principal to let one man go for that reason than it is to insist upon a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.566" offset="4070240">One of the striking examples that accords of this Court’s opinion matter, not long ago perhaps I think last term, in the case out of Arizona where the young man had given -- where the defendant had murdered a child and given a confession to police officer driving back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.519" offset="4133979">We made a decision that it was better that that would be suppressed and perhaps that defendant may have been ultimately released as a societal balancing of the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.915" offset="4183612">But that is not true in the present case, because, as I say, we had no interest in keeping a man where the evidence was insufficient to convict him, forget the Double Jeopardy Clause and all it needs for a moment that society that has no interest where a Court of Appeals has looked at the proof, everything there and has found that the Government has not made the case against the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.054" offset="4312134">Furthermore, there is no difference between raising the issue of insufficient evidence of trial in on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.249" offset="4336898">I think this rule would conserve judicial energy very large, and that sometimes trial judges may let cases go on appeal thinking that the Appellate Court might sort all this out, whereas the defense counsel in trial issues should perhaps to be more diligent in doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.169" offset="4428640">Now, injustice can be exasperated and the defendant cannot make warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.627" offset="4446404">In the present case, for example, defendant has not made warrant in the other cases, I suspect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.827" offset="5227256">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.022" offset="5240004">At least since 1896 when United States against Ball was decided, it has been settled that the Double Jeopardy Clause imposes no limitations on the power to retry a defendant who after being convicted at trial succeeds in having his conviction set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.850" offset="5307295">The principle of this all is the Double Jeopardy Clause and this Court applied it in the Bryan case to reverse all for insufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.075" offset="5344284">Bryan squarely controls this case and in our view, the open question is whether and to what extent Bryan should be reexamined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.574" offset="5386185">Petitioner here like petitioner in the preceding case invokes a syllogism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.338" offset="5409277">It runs like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.424" offset="5417636">One - if the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction the Court should grant a judgment of acquittal without submitting the case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.120" offset="5456402">Two - if the trial judge grants such a judgment of acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.071" offset="5488167">Three - a reversal on appeal because of insufficient evidence amounts to a determination by the Court of Appeals that the trial judge should have granted that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.347" offset="5533306">Four - since what should have been done ought to be treated as if it had been done, this case should be treated as if the judge had granted the judgment of acquittal and the Double Jeopardy Clause therefore bars another trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.549" offset="5698087">For the purpose of this case, we take issue with the conclusion and the part of the fourth premise that is a conclusion rather than a premise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.208" offset="5740719">We think the syllogism suffers from excessive attention to form a rule that an acquittal by the judge is final and that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.208" offset="5784813">It is justified as a means to protect the ability of the defendant to receive a verdict of the jury and to protect his interest in an acquittal that he actually obtains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.526" offset="5830057">But it requires a leap to say that a person who was not acquitted a trial deserves the same treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.827" offset="5859210">This case does not requires speculation about what a jury would had been done if given the chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.970" offset="5883765">It was given the chance, and it returned a verdict of guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.285" offset="6617075">My answer to the Chief Justice's question may be more easily understood once I have established some of the premises of my argument. I would like to turn back in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.300" offset="6661169">I was trying to discuss the reasons why an actual acquittal at trial has been thought to deserve special rule of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.215" offset="6704742">My point then was that petitioner was actually not acquitted at trial; he had no interest in that sort of finality that he was seeking to preserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.320" offset="6749254">In fact, this is a case in which the judge and all 12 jurors concluded that his sanity had been proven beyond the reasonable doubt on the evidence that they heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.364" offset="6785408">Petitioner’s argument rests on a form of symmetry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.176" offset="6796588">If I had been acquitted, I could not be retried; since I should have been acquitted, I should not be retried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.765" offset="6818949">But the argument from symmetry is weak, because it slights the reasons for giving special force to an acquittal that actually took place, and it slights the rule that reversals on appeal of a conviction at trial always have been treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.602" offset="6878299">It is hard to see why a non-obvious defect in the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.458" offset="12245731">Under 2106, the Court of Appeals has the undoubted power simply to order the defendant acquitted and to stop it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.944" offset="12275720">Since it has that power it must have some grounds for deciding when to do that and when to do something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.959" offset="12299752">You would ask that question now in every case and we think that the standards we have suggested for asking that question are more helpful to the courts and certainly do not require it to embark on any inquiry that it is now not making.</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.495" offset="12377911">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.209" offset="12380732">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.378" offset="12389404">I want to give the Chief Justice a better answer to the last question that he asked me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.750" offset="12410929">The question was, did I see any alternative between an acquittal and a new trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.351" offset="12445306">I suppose that I would not argue for absolutist rule here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.877" offset="12475400">I think you might find exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.582" offset="12486266">Solicitor General has pointed out some with which I might agree, some he has pointed out then where the defendant was prevented or the defendant himself prevented the Government from going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.742" offset="12534854">For example, in Smith I case in 1968 in the Sixth Circuit, the defendant in midtrial imposed the insanity defense, but he would not take it him himself and he would not allow a recess would not submit to an examination, and the Sixth Circuit said that was his own fault and he should not profit, because it is a well-known principle of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.313" offset="12617192">Counsel for the United States brought up other exceptions, a changing presumption or inference that District Court might not be aware of or variance between pleading and the proof, and some of those -- this Court I do not think is absolutely required in order to decide this case to render such an absolutist opinion, and the contours of this decision might well be left a later day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.163" offset="12744565">But the facts of this case I think are such that we are not going anywhere near the limits that he urges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.059" offset="12788137">And lastly Mr. Justice Powell mentioned the Bass rule, and I have mentioned the Smith rule in the Sixth Circuit, strangely enough that the Sixth Circuit in this case adapted the Bass rule and the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.599" offset="12850309">But now as I read the Bass case that sends it back for a vague balancing of the equities, but the language that Bass used it says the Government got anymore evidence they would want to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.924" offset="12899628">Well, we do not want that, we want what they did in 1968 in the Sixth Circuit, what the Sixth Circuit has done before, it says the Government has got a reason why they did not use the evidence, not only if they have just got more evidence, but A- they have got more evidence and B - there are some good reason why they did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.591" offset="12978309">So we certainly do not agree with the Bass decision at all.</text>
