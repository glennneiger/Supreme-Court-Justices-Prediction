            <text syncTime="548.961" offset="2195749">The court cites no law which would indicate that there was a trust of after required funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.134" offset="2216438">The trust under Section 7501 provides those taxes required to be collected shall be held in trust, in a fund in trust for the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.656" offset="2330540">However, it is our contention that there is no basis in any of the decided cases and several other circuit court -- or district court cases have held that somehow the minute a dollar came in regardless of the fact that it didn't come in from withholding, the minute it came in and went into the cash drawer, it became impressed with the trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="610.174" offset="2440673">There just is nothing in Section 6672, or Section 7501 which are the only two sections we know of whereby this party, this petitioner could be personally liable for corporate debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.911" offset="2495634">We read the statute strictly because normally an individual, an officer of a corporation is not liable for the debts of the corporation as of course this Court is well aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.051" offset="2536176">It is only where there is some statutory provision such as this that a person becomes personally liable, and the statute, to us is perfectly clear as to who that person is.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.848" offset="2579331">The Congress has cast a net to attempt to protect the revenue so that the person responsible, the individual responsible for the collection, if he doesn't collect or doesn't pay it over shall become personally liable, but we suggest that the Sixth Circuit and the Internal Revenue Service has cast to broad a net.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.540" offset="2658116">They are seeking other persons from whom to collect the tax for which this person had no responsibility, I might suggest to the Court that even the Internal Revenue Service itself was not consistent in stating that the funds as they came in were impressed with the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.771" offset="2723004">The record is clear and the appendix filed in this case will indicate that the Internal Revenue Service insisted during the entire time that they were attempting to collect this past due tax during the six months when Doctor Slodov was in charge of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.386" offset="2781518">They insisted that as funds came in the current taxes had to be paid, the current withholding taxes, not the past taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.289" offset="2813074">They wanted them to take these funds and pay current taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.418" offset="2825613">Now if those funds were in fact impressed with the trust for prior collected taxes then the Internal Revenue Service would have insisted that that's our money, should apply to the old tax and not be applied to the new taxes, but it's perfectly clear that that isn't what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.720" offset="2886844">They and they themselves insisted that some of these funds if there was a diversion of money that came in which we of course do not admit, if there was a diversion it was the requirement not only with the consent but by the requirement of the Internal Revenue Service that current taxes be paid from those funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.977" offset="2959882">So, that there was no trust at least so far as we are concerned there was no trust on those taxes for prior liabilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.086" offset="3504274">On the other hand to say that these people who were there before, the responsible person, suppose they pay the employees in cash and said now give me back the withholding, here is $10 give me a dollar and they put it in their pocket, that's certainly the tax withheld and they went ahead and spent that money.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.244" offset="13500918">Such tax is the tax required to be collected by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.799" offset="13523174">As Mr. Justice Stevens said, if it were not that tax then the individual could be held liable for corporate income taxes and every other tax along the board if such tax only meant any tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.928" offset="13579703">It means such tax means any tax required to be collected by him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.825" offset="13615229">We are talking about tax for particular period, not just any old withholding taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.505" offset="13633933">If in fact what the government says is true then a man could today become a responsible officer, pay every dollar he owned, leave the company, the next people did not pay the withholding taxes and he could be held responsible under the government's interpretation, because one time he was a responsible officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.305" offset="13701120">They said that all three of those things did converge when he become the responsible officer, but that doesn't mean he is only responsible for the period of time when they converged, but for the period of time before, well if before why not after and I suggest you that this is not what was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.332" offset="13765277">The fact of the matter is that in this case when the government knew that the tax was not paid, Mr. Dr. Slodov went to them paid the tax because he was advised that funds were available to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.246" offset="13812924">So he decided that if the funds were available he would pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.874" offset="13871438">When he brought the company he knew that there was a withholding tax liability of the company, but he had been advised by the seller of the stock to him that the money was in the bank all you got to do is go in and pay, it is due tomorrow, you are going to write the checks and pay the money, he went in and the money wasn't there.</text>
