            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="10.891" offset="123468">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.872" offset="143425">The issue is as to the proper venue in a state court of a transitory cause of action against a National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.956" offset="183758">The resolution of the case depends on the construction of a Federal Statute formerly Section 94 of Title 12 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.147" offset="232555">This statute resides an action against a National Bank in Federal Court, may be had where the bank is established, but when it is the State Court it may be held where the bank is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.010" offset="292010">The petitioners Citizens and Southern is a National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.161" offset="304549">It's home office is in Savannah, Georgia, but it has branches in other places in the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.604" offset="338403">This action was brought against Decould County, I think they call it DeKalb county down there, near Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.978" offset="367869">The bank moved a dismissal suit on grounds of improper venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.340" offset="385319">The county court denied that motion and the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.550" offset="406113">In an opinion filed with a clerk today, we hold that the venue for a suit against a National Bank brought in a State Court need not be in the county where the bank's charter was issued, in this case in Chatham county where Savannah is located, but may it be in a county in which the bank conducts its business at an authorized branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.222" offset="500885">The judgment of the Court of Appeals of the State of Georgia is therefore affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.012" offset="520007">Mr. Justice Stewart has joined the opinion but has filed a separate concurring statement.</text>
