            <label>Mr. Robert Masur</label>
            <text syncTime="14.867" offset="139433">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.234" offset="152912">Mr. Miller is an ex-offender who was denied a license necessary to seek employment in the City of Chicago as a public chauffeur.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.431" offset="197634">Before the Court today is a question of constitutionality of that part of the ordinance which bars his licenser for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.943" offset="235668">Unfortunately, Luther Miller's story is altogether too familiar in our society today.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.494" offset="265865">A man convicted of a felony prior to the time he reached 20 years of age, a man who was sentenced to serve a term in prison, and who upon release, as an adult, finds himself faced with numerous occupationally disabling requirements.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="70.754" offset="362936">Would your case be any different, with the issue would be any different if his convictions had been at the age 40, let us say, instead of 20?</text>

            <text syncTime="80.624" offset="402434">The ordinance would similar be on constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.626" offset="418420">At the early time, when Mr. Miller's need for a job is most acute, at the very time when it is most important for him to attempt to establish himself as a reputable member of the society, he finds that the collateral consequences of his conviction make it difficult for him to find employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.109" offset="520402">Such was the case for Mr. Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.906" offset="531583">Nine-and-one-half years after his conviction Miller applied for a public chauffeur's license from the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.236" offset="564915">The license was a prerequisite for a number of common unskilled jobs in the City of Chicago including private bus drivers, private chauffeurs, and most typically taxicab drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.853" offset="619354">Miller's application was denied because the ordinance here at question prohibits a licenser for life of anyone who was convicted of an offense involving the use of a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.906" offset="671599">No pardon from the Executive of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.075" offset="688213">No certificate of rehabilitation from the Court of Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.596" offset="702319">No conduct which Mr. Miller might engage in subsequent to his conviction, lawful conduct, will in anyway remove that bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.339" offset="753310">Mr. Miller's story is therefore both typical and atypical in our society today.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.600" offset="778283">It is typical because there are in fact numerous occupational disqualifications which are applied to ex-offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.121" offset="816422">It is for that reason the American Bar Association filed its amicus brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.773" offset="838992">It is for that reason that the ABA has generally banned leading a nationwide drive to remove the kind of disabling licenser requirements which is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.307" offset="897193">This ordinance is atypical, because it is the most severe and restrictive ordinance that at least counsel for the respondent has ever encountered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.903" offset="7635531">Just a few comments Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.102" offset="7648383">In response to Justice Stevens' question of yesterday and today with the differential treatment, it is our feeling that there has been some misconception in what the burden of the City is here and primarily who has the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.585" offset="7710241">I think we would all agree if we are talking about equal protection, then the burden is primarily not that of the legislative body or the City in establishing justification for the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.163" offset="7760605">It is presumed to be well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.305" offset="7769173">And then the second issue is whether or not there really is any justification for treating the two classifications or two parties differently, and we submit that there is a basis for treating them differently and that primarily is because one has status of being on the job or having a license and has a greater interest and that must be considered in terms of this Court's ruling in Roth and Sinderman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.866" offset="7875439">In terms of making sure that it is arbitrarily deprived and they are entitled to a hearing and they are titled to more rights and more consideration, this has been traditionally the case of all instances in dealing with individuals who have employment and individuals who do not have employment that their right that is the right to the individual on the job are greater than the right to the individual not on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.502" offset="7965927">That does not suggest that they can be arbitrarily dealt with but they are dealt with differently and we are submitting that the test for the burden of the City is not to demonstrate, there is not invidious discrimination, and that there is a rational relationship, and that this is conclusively related to public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.589" offset="8038234">But our burden is really to show that there is some reason for treating the classes differently and the burden is on the other side to show that there is no reason, and we submit that there is reason for treating the parties differently and what we have here also is a two-tier problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.214" offset="8100824">The first problem is to determine whether or not it is reasonable to treat people who are convicted of a crime dealing with a weapon differently than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.792" offset="8151083">We submit it is related to the goal of protecting the traveling public in cabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.322" offset="8177206">That has been accepted by the court below and we think it is rational to submit that that is related to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.822" offset="8207194">Secondly, is there any basis for treating licensees that is incumbents and applicants differently?</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.348" offset="8237287">We submit yes, that the rights in the interest at stake are different and that in the case of incumbents or licensees Roth, Sinderman require that they would be given further right and further benefits than do applicants or applicants entitled to receive.</text>
