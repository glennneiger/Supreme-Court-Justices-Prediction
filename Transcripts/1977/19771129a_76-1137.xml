            <label>Mr. Daniel D. Levenson</label>
            <text syncTime="13.966" offset="135783">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.608" offset="150411">This case focuses on Sections of the Internal Revenue Code, dealing with personal holding companies and corporations which unnecessarily accumulate income.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.691" offset="194715">These special provisions have been placed in the code to deal with the shareholders of those companies who wish to accumulate income in a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.669" offset="234630">Such accumulation would thereby shield the corporate profits from the second tax at the high tax rates imposed upon the recipients of dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.872" offset="283427">Until 1921, Congress dealt with these shareholders directly by taxing them on their pro rata share of corporate earnings, regardless of whether or not those earnings were distributed to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.789" offset="335045">However, after this Court’s decision in 1921, in the case of Eisner v. Macomber, doubts arose as to the constitutionality of such a direct taxing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.722" offset="386872">Therefore, Congress provided an alternative method.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.245" offset="404948">It allowed the shareholders to determine if they wish to account for their corporate profits and their incomes directly whether or not distributed, but failing that, Congress created an incentive to encourage corporations which had been determined to be unnecessarily accumulating their income to actually make distributions of the unneeded income to their shareholders which could then be taxed at the individual rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.916" offset="523649">Congress did this by imposing what it thought to be a virtually confiscatory tax on the undistributed income of these corporations and then by providing a deduction for dividends distributed to shareholders which directly reduces the income subject to the additional tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.124" offset="604419">It is this dividends paid deduction which is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.448" offset="625735">Specifically, the question involves the determination of the amount of the deduction when a corporation distributes a dividend consisting of property rather than cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.405" offset="677562">The government maintains that the fair market value of the property at the date of distribution should be totally disregarded, even though the shareholder who receives the property is taxed in full on that value.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.737" offset="738898">The government has done this by promulgating Treas. Reg. 1.562-1 (a), the regulation involved in this case, which regulation states that when property is distributed by a corporation, the dividends paid deduction shall equal the properties adjusted basis, not its fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.284" offset="833043">We maintain that this regulation as it pertains to this case is inconsistent with the Internal Revenue Code, is arbitrary, totally without statutory or legislative support and leads to irrational results.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.113" offset="896364">For those reasons, we submit that the regulation should be declared to be invalid.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel D. Levenson</label>
            <text syncTime="320.785" offset="1363120">We have fought long and hard on that Your Honor and we think without any way to prove its correctness that the government regulation, writing the treasury in 1956 when these regulations were proposed, saw the typographical error in the committee reports dealing with Section 562.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.862" offset="1455384">That typographical error has been referred to in our briefs and in particular in the opinion of the district court judge in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.374" offset="1489448">The typographical error refers in a senate report to Section 312.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.165" offset="1516615">That was the original Section in the House Bill that dealt with “definition” of a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.202" offset="1548694">When the senate did its work on the code, it changed the numbering, changing the numbering of that particular Section dealing with the dividend from 312 to 316.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.956" offset="1595714">Somehow the reference to 312 remained in the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.855" offset="1619329">Now, what we have also done is to track down in the actual senate amendments which can be found in the Congressional record, the technical wording of the amendment which said regarding Section 562 change all references 316 to 312.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.588" offset="1698323">So to answer your question specifically, I do not know the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.564" offset="1714205">I can only guess that someone was confused by the Section 312 reference, saw the provisions of Section 312, which talks about the reduction of earnings and profits only by adjusted basis and wrote the regulation accordingly.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="427.600" stopTime="430.788">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="427.600" offset="1790378">312 should be read as 316, should not it?</text>

            <text syncTime="430.788" offset="1803126">In the committee reports it should be read as 316 we maintain, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.911" offset="1835623">To relieve the corporation of a penalty tax by providing a dividends paid deduction to the same extent that a shareholder receives taxable income is not only symmetrical, but also accurately reflects the basic statutory purposes of these laws in a specific statutory relationships of the 1954 code.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.934" offset="1919632">If the deduction is greater then the amount taxed to the shareholder then there would be no incentive to distribute the full amount intended to be distributed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.673" offset="1962578">A deduction for less then the amount taxed to the shareholder would require corporations to distribute property with a value in excess of the amount subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.207" offset="2004792">We submit that neither result is consistent with Congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.045" offset="2032063">Now, it is clear from the legislative history of the 1954 code that Congress envisioned a coherent, integrated system of corporate shareholder taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.093" offset="2080338">As part of this scheme, it refined the definition of the term dividend to be a very precise term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.880" offset="2111476">It might be useful to think of a dividend as a molecule, having several atomic components, each of which is absolutely necessary to the character of the final product, namely a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.630" offset="2166437">First there has to be a distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.247" offset="2180961">That distribution must be a distribution covered by Section 301 of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.133" offset="2204472">Then there must be -- that distribution must be of property as that term is defined in Section 317 A of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.626" offset="2242401">The amount of the distribution must be determined as set forth in Section 301 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="547.665" offset="2270614">Finally the corporation must have earnings and profits calculated as indicated in Section 312.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.029" offset="7208070">Mr Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.093" offset="7220295">The only issue here is whether Section 1.562-1 (a) of the regulations is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.593" offset="7250284">These regulations of course provide that a personal holding companies, dividends paid deduction with respect to a distribution in kind should be determined by the corporation's adjusted basis, generally it is investment in the property distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.208" offset="7316739">We submit that the First Circuit below was entirely correct in holding that the regulations we are consistent with the objectives and terms of the revenue act and were indeed consistent with congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.728" offset="7374836">To begin with, this Court has often held that great difference should be accorded to interpretations given a statute by the officers charged with its administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.290" offset="7421125">Indeed this Court has held that treasury regulations must be sustained unless plainly inconsistent -- unless unreasonable and plainly inconsistent with the revenue statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.317" offset="7469190">The present regulations cannot be held deficient under those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.266" offset="7493014">In our view the whole of petitioners argument that these regulations are invalid is premised on an unhistorical and over simplified view of the personal holding company and accumulated earnings taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.997" offset="7551946">Essentially, petitioner's argument begins with a premise that personal holding company and accumulated earnings taxes were designed to discourage the use of corporate vehicles as a means of avoiding the progressive tax applicable to shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.643" offset="7622476">It then notes that individual shareholders are taxable upon the full fair market value of the property they received from corporations as a distribution in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.846" offset="7679319">The argument then jumps to the conclusion that the only measure appropriate for determining the corporate dividends paid deduction is the measure used to determine the amount includable in shareholder income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.375" offset="7741386">That argument cannot be squared with history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.524" offset="7754029">Historically the personal holding company tax and the dividend paid deduction first came into the code in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.465" offset="7793840">At that time, the Congress did not define specifically the effect a distribution of property in kind would have with respect to the corporations dividend paid deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.931" offset="7863639">The 1936 Act, however, soon filled that gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.258" offset="7880984">In 1936, the Congress passed Section 27 (c), a Section later recodified as Section 27 (d) of the 39 code and in that Section it explicitly provided that a corporation's dividend paid deduction with respect to a dividend in kind should be determined by the lesser of basis or fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.853" offset="7995296">That rule enacted by Congress in 1936 then would provide exactly the same result as the rule under the regulations would effect with respect to this tax payer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.810" offset="8087143">As part of the same Revenue Act, the Revenue Act of 1936, Congress also defined exactly the effect a distribution in kind would have upon individual shareholders, shareholder recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.998" offset="8155897">In section 115 (j) of the 36 Act, Congress explicitly provided that shareholder recipients of distributions in kind should include those distributions in their income to the full extent of the fair market value of the property received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.292" offset="8249102">In the face of this history, it is a little difficult to conceive how petitioners can now argue that the purpose of the personal holding company tax would be fully served by a rule that keys corporate dividends paid deductions to the amount includable in shareholder income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.743" offset="8330917">Obviously, when Congress faced the question in 1936, it concluded that such a rule would not fully serve the purpose of the personal holding company to tax, Specifically, these taxes, the personal holding company tax and the accumulated earnings tax attached an undistributed or accumulated taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.991" offset="8459858">Those income items specifically encompass only fully realized income items, income items realized and recognized at the corporate level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.115" offset="8524432">The rule tax payer advocates here would permit a deduction with respect to those realized, fully recognized income items with respect to income items that have never been realized at a corporate level.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.639" offset="12814470">A comment was made that, a question was asked rather whether Congress intended to give to the treasury an area of discretion in promulgating regulations under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.086" offset="12860236">I would like to plan out to the Court that in the Internal Revenue Code in particular when Congress intents to give broad discretionary power to the treasury, it specifically indicates such as in the consolidated return regulations, allocation of income and deductions between tax payers and other broad areas where Congress has stated its policy and says to treasury you fill it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.789" offset="12955113">Those are known as legislative regulations and are usually given great weight by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.869" offset="12979459">My brother says that we, tax payer’s counsel agree that nothing in the code dictates how a dividend in property is to be valued at the corporate level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.881" offset="13027420">That is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.414" offset="13033585">We do not agree that the code is silent on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.416" offset="13049572">In fact, we state that the code indicates the Unitary integrated concept about which we referred and that this is the same method of evaluation valuing a dividend at the corporate level as at the shareholder level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.046" offset="13116132">The regulation does not require that we prove that the property has been purchased with personal holding company income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.974" offset="13147792">The corporation can distribute property that has been acquired in any manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.479" offset="13165869">The “adjusted basis” rule does not necessarily reflect personal holding company income, that is the adjusted basis of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.221" offset="13192827">For example, if I had ten central stock of high basis and low value and had a personal holding company, I could, under the government’s rule contribute that stock to the corporation, a non-taxable event, the following year or even may be the same year have that corporation distribute out that high basis property and take away the personal holding company tax potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.253" offset="13288958">And that is the way that adjusted basis can be utilized to defeat the intention of Congress and what should be the intention of the treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.138" offset="13336501">A comment was made that prior to 1936 there was no valuation rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.686" offset="13362728">We believe that prior to 1936 the courts believed that the value of the dividend was to be the value of the property distributed and it was only in the context of the undistributed profits tax in 1936 that the rule was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.893" offset="13423541">That it was not changed because Congress looked and thought hard on this issue, but rather it was changed to accomplish the closing of the loophole that I referred to in the main portion of my argument.</text>
