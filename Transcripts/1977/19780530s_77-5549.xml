            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79984">Now last case I have is a criminal case, entirely different in subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.228" offset="100882">In this case, 77-5549, Taylor against Kentucky, petitioner was convicted a robbery in a Kentucky State Court, in a case in which there were only two witnesses, the alleged victim and the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.655" offset="166502">The Prosecutor in his opening statement read the indictment to the jury and in his closing statement emphasized petitioner's status as a defendant, giving rise according to his argument to inferences of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.530" offset="226061">Petitioner later sought an instruction to the -- instruction to the jury that the indictment was not evidence of his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.941" offset="259706">He also requested an instruction that he was presumed to be innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.130" offset="276425">The court refused to give either of these instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.396" offset="289486">It did, however, correctly instruct, though briefly, on the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.109" offset="312369">Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to five years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.982" offset="327834">Appellate courts in Kentucky sustained the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.834" offset="347269">To assure a verdict based solely on evidence and not on one status of the diffident, the presumption of innocence should be emphasized in instructions to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.928" offset="395648">Although no particular form of wedge is necessary to assure jury understanding, we conclude in this case, for reasons stated in our opinion filled today with clerk, that petitioner was not given a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.230" offset="456879">Accordingly the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion filed today with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.889" offset="491465">Mr. Justice Brennan has filled a concurring statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.117" offset="504422">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist joined.</text>
