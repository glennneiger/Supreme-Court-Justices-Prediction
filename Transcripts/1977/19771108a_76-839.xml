            <text syncTime="272.478" offset="1170148">Because that is how the statute sweeps and that includes those two if you want possibly distinguishable sub-classes, those that can and those that cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.448" offset="1214033">The right at stake here is employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.949" offset="1228035">This Court has consistently held and in conjunction with alien rights that employment is a crucial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.302" offset="1261472">In particular, this is employment in a Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.771" offset="1291356">For whatever reasons may be evoked to justify such an exclusion it was seem to frustrate rather further these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.703" offset="1331062">To have an efficient police force you want to have the largest pool to select from of capable individuals by excluding aliens whose contributions we welcome in other spheres, we cut down that possibility, we eliminate certain applicants who may be superior to those who would be accepted when you eliminate this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.283" offset="1417370">In particular, since we are a country, also heterogeneity and country traditional immigrants and there are large foreign speaking populations.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.708" offset="1459062">It can even be suggested as the Amicus has that there is a need to go into this pool of potential foreign speakers and people who have so ability to relate from time-to-time petition to immigrant proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.899" offset="1579852">That was not suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.718" offset="1583091">The suggestion is that is truly probably to recruit for particular skills, regardless of race, creed or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.020" offset="1612348">For example, if you have a large Spanish speaking population you might want to recruit Spanish speaking policemen regardless of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.006" offset="1656339">If you exclude yourself or have excluded from the pool a large population which speaks Spanish as well as English you may in fact illumining your ability to recruit able police officers with this what you are looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.117" offset="1712763">What I am suggesting is that the Amicus suggestion may have some validity that there may be virtue even looking out for aliens to respond to particular community needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.360" offset="1757694">But that in no question the ultimate resolution has to be the merit of the individual to serve the police force, they must pass those tests and the more people we have applying ability the more likely we are to have a better group to in fact carry out the law enforcement duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2302.106" offset="9288691">That is correct and for example, California which does require citizenship for its State Police Officers, apparently does not require citizenship for its State Highway Patrol and possible elaboration of Mr. Blackmun's comment before the division of New York Police is not divided into a Highway Patrol, a specialized division covering more significant matters in a uniform force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.675" offset="9403003">It is one division encompassing three functional units, namely the uniform force which provides a first line response and it consist of officers who go out and arrest and search and perform all the functions we have discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.470" offset="9458174">One of those units is a through way patrol unit but its functions are not limited to giving tickets on the New York State through way, rather it has the criminal jurisdiction for that through way and it arrests and searches and may stop and give highway tickets but performs all functions of enforcement within that geographical area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.825" offset="9543542">On addition, I would comment that while the BCI, the Bureau of Criminal Investigation is a plain close unit and it does have a specific state security function, its powers and it is pursuit of its investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.947" offset="9600071">In other words, the exercise of its powers in the pursuit of its investigation is no different than the response required of the uniform officer who makes up the uniform force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.060" offset="9648554">One last aspect on that would be that the governance detail perhaps akin to the secret service of the United States is itself a branch consisting essentially of uniform officers with several BCI personnel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.634" offset="9882820">For example, if as this court has at least impliedly held in its held in its prior decisions, voting and legislating can be functions consigned to citizens, even though the voter is remote from the law making process himself and his vote maybe one in millions in any given state or general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.410" offset="9957948">One to hold for the appellant it would appear to me, one would have to find that the police officers exercises for these extraordinary powers of his arrest and search, of his use of force, indeed, deadly forces power over life and death of any individual on the society, in the name of state is somehow less important that that voter's vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.318" offset="10045511">I do not think that that can possibly the -- an analytically sound distinction and accordingly it would appear to me as we have argued that once we determine that the juror performs a governmental office such that citizenship maybe required of him, we then must likewise find that the police officer similarly performs functions of significant and governmental nature such that his class may likewise be close to aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.239" offset="10153240">I think by the way that this is one of the force of the dissent below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.642" offset="10166823">The dissent characteristics voting and legislating as political.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.572" offset="10186572">It eschews the same characterization obviously for the police force and I do not think that that distinction again can be made because in a government of three equal branches, we cannot designate voting especially under the circumstances as I outlined, where it may have very little, if any potential ramification as more important that law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.330" offset="10277583">Law and enforcement as we designated as more important then are the judicial function of interpreting the law and I think this is one of the erroneous assumptions that the dissent below makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.665" offset="10326902">I would say, several other points with respect to that dissent and that is with respect to the issue raised by Justice Mansfield and I think briefly by Justice Marshall before, that is aside from the designation of a class of officer holders is there anything about the alien by virtue of his status which makes him peculiarly unsuitable to perform the functions of police and while we all urge this is a secondary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.659" offset="10426899">We believe that there are in fact such situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.567" offset="10438497">For example, the alien cannot vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.333" offset="10449573">To call upon him then for the vigorous enforcement of the law, laws which he has no voice in creating would appear to be egregiously anomalous.</text>

The issue pertains to the army but of course, the much more difficult issues than in this case, these are both Federal and also national security but in terms of the congressional statement implicitly as to the reliability of aliens who served in a police force this would be a fairly powerful implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.086" offset="11744619">The discretion that a police officer has is not a political discretion, it is not a policy discretion, it is a discretion different in function and in nature, those acts and count thought of in the Dougall suggestion.</text>
