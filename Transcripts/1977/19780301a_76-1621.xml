            <text syncTime="72.693" offset="370672">This case is here because 10 judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit divided five to five on the question whether there was more than merely colorable substance to an allegation that John Brick, a senate investigator violated respondent’s rights when he took copies of some of their papers in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.752" offset="462936">We do not pursue here the question that divided the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.616" offset="478401">We argue instead that the speech or debate clause bars respondent’s suit whether or not Brick erred.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.046" offset="552066">I have the same curiosity here.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.602" offset="642345">They equated it – they essentially followed the analysis of this Court followed in Abney, that is that since the speech or debate clause creates a right not to be questioned in any other place, and since the process of discovery in trial is the kind of questioning that the speech or debate clause forbids, if it applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.037" offset="712040">Then there is a right to an interlocutory appeal to have that question resolved before discovery and trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.856" offset="731370">The En Banc Court adopted that and we do not understand that respondent’s dispute of that analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.978" offset="863863">This case grew out of the 1967 seizure of respondent’s papers by Kentucky officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.507" offset="885911">Respondents have not contended that the federal government or the Congress played any role in the initial seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.702" offset="914750">After the seizure, a three-judge District Court declared unconstitutional the Kentucky statute pursuant to which the seizure had been made and it entered an order which I will call the safekeeping order, directing the Kentucky State’s attorney to keep custody of the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.580" offset="982250">A senate subcommittee was then investigating urban riots.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.359" offset="1253401">An appeal then went into the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which held that the District Court’s custody order should have expired once the time for appeal had lapsed.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.911" offset="1387566">It also contended that the senate subcommittee subpoena was a violation of their constitutional rights, that the procuring of a citation for contempt of Congress was a violation of their constitutional rights for which they could recover damages and there were a very large number of other allegations essentially challenging the entire course of conduct both in the three-judge District Court and before the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.378" offset="1753490">On the day that it was handed to him at his motel in Kentucky, the three-Judge District Court had already entered an order enjoining the state prosecution, relying on Debrowski against Pfister as the authority for the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.642" offset="1802495">The the time for – the final time for appeal of that order had not been expired and there had been no alteration in the safekeeping order which had been entered earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.309" offset="1841157">The safekeeping order was entered I believe on September 14, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.965" offset="1863831">Mr. Brick paid his visit on October 8 and October 9, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.841" offset="1887341">He then returned on October 16, 1967 with a subpoena which was -- with several subpoenas which were served on Ratcliffe, the custodian on the United States Marshall and on the McSurelys.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.173" offset="1940631">Those subpoenas eventually led to the state proceedings in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.065" offset="1960170">After the documents were finally returned, after the Sixth Circuit had ordered that they be returned, a new subpoena was served on the McSurelys and they were called before Congress personally to the subpoena and refused either to testify or to produce the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.064" offset="2016177">They were cited for contempt of Congress and they were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.425" offset="2033627">That conviction was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.568" offset="2042195">The ground for reversal was that the subpoena was a fruit of the poisonous tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.836" offset="2063302">The tree was poisonous, the Court of Appeals ruled because the initial search was conducted pursuant to an over broad warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.572" offset="2094231">The warrant which appears in page 76 of the appendix, authorized state detective to search the McSurely’s home and find therein any seditious literature and seize the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.732" offset="2142819">The Court of Appeals concluded quite correctly that that was over broad because it did not specify what was to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.655" offset="2170508">Meanwhile, on the same day they appeared before the senate subcommittee pursuant to the subpoena, respondents filed this suit seeking damages for alleged violations of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.688" offset="2210632">The complaint as amended named Senator McCullen, Brick, Ratcliffe and two senate employees as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.137" offset="2244487">The Court of Appeals found in the complaint seven categories of alleged wrong, covering the entire course of conduct through the issuance of the subpoenas and the citations for contempt of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.161" offset="2284611">Only two of those categories concern us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.325" offset="2297254">On the other five, the Court unanimously held that the speech or debate clause bars any action by respondents and they have not filed a cross petition from that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.260" offset="2332990">The Court of Appeals ordered further proceedings, including discovery and perhaps trial with respect to two types of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.127" offset="2364441">The first is Brick’s looking at and taking to Washington the 234 copies without first obtaining the permission of the three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.497" offset="2405924">The second is the allegation that the subcommittee disseminated some or all of the 234 copies to agents of the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.797" offset="2443122">Because the first question concerning Brick’s activities presents the most difficult problems, I intend to discuss only those problems during oral argument unless time permits.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.171" offset="2612605">The Court of Appeals found them to be essentially the same question and I think that is the problem with the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.338" offset="2645310">But I think it is easier to answer that question if I can set up first what I see is the way both Judge Wilkie and Judge Leventhal approached the question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.380" offset="2685434">I think the Court of Appeals employed a three-step syllogism and it ran like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.965" offset="2707795">First, the speech or debate clause protects activities that are essential to legislating.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.570" offset="2730260">Second, the employment of unlawful means is not essential to legislating.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.218" offset="2756801">Third, therefore the speech or debate clause does not extend to cases in which a colorable claim of unlawful conduct is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.156" offset="2792536">The 10 judges of the Court of Appeals, Mr. Justice Rehnquist then divided equally on the question whether a colorable claim of wrongdoing had been made out.</text>

            <text syncTime="690.652" offset="2842587">We start from the same premise that is that the speech or debate clause protects activities that are essential to legislating, but our course thereafter is significantly different from that followed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.898" offset="2891488">We believe that gathering information as part of an inquiry into a subject on which legislation could be had is essential to legislating.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.931" offset="2927641">We believe that Servicemen’s Fund held at least that much.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.803" offset="2947181">Brick was concededly gathering information as part of an inquiry into a subject on which legislation could be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.024" offset="2976020">The Court of Appeals unanimously agreed with that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.893" offset="2991485">We conclude from this that because Brick was engaged in an activity leading potentially to legislation, that his activities in general are covered by the speech or debate clause and the fact that he erred, that is that he may have used unlawful means or violated the Fourth Amendment in obtaining access to the documents is therefore not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.947" offset="3079674">In that sense, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the statement of the cause of action in the speech or debate immunity question are really quite separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.267" offset="3109036">After all, the speech or debate immunity exists only to erect a shield against charges of wrong doing, even constitutional wrongdoing as this Court said in Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.449" offset="3149682">An immunity that protects only when no wrong has been committed would be no immunity at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.707" offset="3174760">We take the Court of Appeals to hold that the immunity is dissipated by a colorable claim of wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.389" offset="3197434">That is the same thing as abolishing the immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.150" offset="3208510">Because otherwise, a motion for summary judgment or a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action would be granted and there would be no need for immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.600" offset="3242365">The Court of Appeals in other words has held that the immunity pertains only when the complaint would have been dismissed on its face.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.479" offset="4717865">The process of litigation and of determining whether this was such an intentional abuse, Mr. Justice Stewart is one of the things to which the speech or debate clause was most closely directed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.229" offset="4824863">This Court’s cases show that quite often, take for example the claim that someone’s house was searched without a warrant which is at least on its face and presumptively a violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.351" offset="4869375">It may turn out that the defense has exigent circumstances and that requires extremely time consuming and complicated litigation in many cases just to determine whether that was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.574" offset="4918277">Even so, I have to acknowledge that the argument for immunity is an argument for indulgence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.581" offset="4938234">It asks for forbearance rather than approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.158" offset="4952549">The claim does not and cannot have any error of just treatment to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.936" offset="4967700">Yet the framers decided that forbearance is the better course and that error is not a reason to overcome the immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.166" offset="4996644">To the contrary, the fact that error is inevitable, that some men are wicked and that grievances are plentiful, it is the reason why there is immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.033" offset="5028095">This shows we think that the allegation of even a blatant violation cannot lightly pierce the immunity, but our answer does not stop there to your problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.434" offset="5061637">Your question Mr. Justice Stewart assumes intentional misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.853" offset="5079295">Yet the speech or debate clause forbids scrutiny of intent, of the subjective intent of the actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.763" offset="5115031">Servicemen’s fund said that at pages 508 to 509.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.107" offset="5132376">This Court said so in the Johnson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.346" offset="5141362">It said so in Tenny against Branhoe of the Common Law variant of state legislator’s immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.116" offset="5168425">Therefore, it is difficult to treat your hypothetical as a case in which intent can be proved because it cannot be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.191" offset="5192667">We must treat it for present purposes as an unintentional but apparently very serious violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.768" offset="5218998">Otherwise, the rule simply invites plaintiffs to charge intent and pierce the immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.484" offset="5237911">For this consideration too, counsels against easily allowing trials of claims of intentional misconduct, but beyond that we think the claim of intentional misconduct requires consideration of two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.906" offset="5303530">First is the question which we think is dispositive here whether the activity viewed objectively was part of a legislative inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.514" offset="5338012">The second question and the one that led me to answer your question yes, probably is whether Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to conduct such an inquiry, that is whether what happened was part of the legislative business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.713" offset="5410737">We think clearly that this case involves the first of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.528" offset="5425992">The Court of Appeals held that Brick was conducting a legislative inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.697" offset="5442711">For this purpose, for the purpose of the legislative inquiry question, it should make no difference how serious the Fourth Amendment violation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.740" offset="5474894">If the investigation seen objectively was directed toward legislation then the immunity is absolute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.741" offset="6174871">Those cases in which this Court has held in the past that the speech or debate clause does not protect particular activities, have essentially been cases in which the Court concluded that that activity was none of Congress’ business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.626" offset="6226384">In the Killborn case in which the sergeant at arms of the house went out and made an arrest for the purpose of coercing a witness into testifying, the conclusion of this Court was that Congress had no summary contempt powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.150" offset="6276539">That is that it was attempting to exercise powers committed by the Constitution to the judicial branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.084" offset="6300259">In the Gravel case and the Doe case in which this Court held that the speech or debate clause did not apply to publicity, the holding was that the Article 1 power of Congress did not include a power to publicize information for the sake of publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.748" offset="6358877">In Powell against McCormick, where it held that the speech or debate immunity did not bar representative Powell’s attempts to get back in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.184" offset="6396703">The conclusion was that Article 1 of the Constitution did not authorize the exclusion of a duly elected member except for the three qualifications explicitly stated in Article 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.199" offset="6440693">All of those cases are cases essentially holding that Congress was engaged in a pursuit that exceeded the authorization given it by Article 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.780" offset="6475070">For that purpose too, we think, it makes no difference whether somebody violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.270" offset="8108977">Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.573" offset="8130188">I believe that the reason why the interrogation of Mr. Easterbrook has developed as it did and why the government had to respond to some of the questions as it did is because in fact the government in its petition and its brief has staked out a rather extreme position and seeks an interpretation of the speech and debate clause which is highly unacceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.836" offset="8263308">But surprisingly the government as it developed its position takes no account to the fact that this tension, to use the word of Mr. Rehnquist, between the problems of protecting congressional independence while at the same time avoiding abuse is a problem which is a thoroughly familiar problem, in English constitutional history and it has a problem which this which this Court has dealt time and time and time again.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton Stavis</label>
            <text syncTime="2099.253" offset="8476990">Well that is assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.393" offset="8485454">It has not been disputed and the motion papers raise only the question of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.336" offset="8513248">Now, it is not as if as this problem has first come before this Court today or that the government is writing on a clean slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.954" offset="8563717">The reality is that the Court has always understood that precisely because the speech and debate immunity is absolute, it is not to be so widely handed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.941" offset="8611677">It is limited in scope and limited to the kinds of activities that it applies to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.845" offset="8671341">And in case they have to case and various language formulation what comes out is that the speech and debate clause applies to the core of legislative activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.462" offset="8729751">Congressman and Senators making speeches, voting, holding hearings, committee reports and then Servicemen’s, issuing subpoenas, but it does not apply to peripheral activities, there is a wide variety of activities that Congressman and Senators engage in, to which it simply does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.217" offset="8840823">And of course one of the clearest formulations of that Mr. Chief Justice was in your own opinion in the Brewster Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.561" offset="8866214">When Senator Brewster came here and said it applies to all matters that relate to legislative activity and of course the Court held that that was not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.294" offset="8917101">Now, there was an important and rather clear line which distinguishes this case from the cases where speech and debate immunity should apply and which is rather confusingly addressed by Mr. Easterbrook when he deals with the Dembrowski Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.068" offset="9008216">As constant formulation it says that in the Dembrowski case this Court approved the takeover of documents, but that was pursuant to a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.261" offset="9076970">A subpoena was served and the person who is served with the subpoena responded by delivering the documents and Court approved that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.175" offset="9128588">The critical fact here is that the action complained off occurred without benefit of any subpoena whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="4002.986" offset="16091893">That is it compels someone to respond in a particular way on pane of law for disobedience, but it would be very odd we think to say that Congress has the power within the scope of the speech or debate clause to obtain information only when it finds it necessary to compel that information from the hands of persons who may be unwilling to supply it.</text>
