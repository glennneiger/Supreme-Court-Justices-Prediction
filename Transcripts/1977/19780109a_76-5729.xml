            <text syncTime="208.788" offset="915078">The reservation is similar to the Pearl River Indian Reservation (Ph) with which this Court I am sure is familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.449" offset="949769">The land area of the reservation is approximately 7,300 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.801" offset="967114">Two-thirds of that land is owned by non-Indians and some Indians in fee and that is subject to local taxes for payment of public services.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.017" offset="1003999">One-third of the land approximately is individually owned, a lot of land with title held in trust by the United States for the protection of those individual Indian allottees and it is exempt from taxation and I may note to make a distinguishing factor of these allotments arose here primarily under the Treaty of Point Elliott.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.593" offset="1174318">In 1973, the time of the Oliphant incident, the tribe had leased to a non-Indian corporation with approval of the United States, the last remaining unoccupied, unallotted trust lands on the reservation and all that there was a portion known as the Ball Park and that is where the Oliphant incident took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.933" offset="1283718">As of 1973, only 50 adult and minor tribal members lived on the reservation or inter-dispersed in residential areas among in approximately non-Indian residential population of 3,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.028" offset="1348084">No distinct community occupying any certain area existed anywhere on the reservation in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.774" offset="1383088">In 1965, a total enrolled membership of 112 tribal members entitled to vote in tribal elections, fifty-six members elected and adapted a constitution for the tribe as authorized by the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and approved by the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.628" offset="1474412">It provides for a limited powers of government by a General Council and in a Tribal Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.903" offset="1495519">Franchise to vote is in the General Council and through an election by the members they also elect pastors in the tribal counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.173" offset="1556646">The limitation on voting and membership is that they must be 1/8th Indian Blood and generally 18 years or over.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.589" offset="1602308">The Tribal Council as such is the executive branch of the General Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.849" offset="1627385">Because of the limited executive powers of the tribal ordinances that is governing the Indians in the constitution which restricts in effect the executive body to regulate in hunting and fishing and shell fishing, ordinances may be promulgated through via Tribal Council provided the Secretary of Interior approves.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.898" offset="1727487">Therefore, the most recent ordinances relevant to this case have been passed by a General Council of all of the eligible voters and members of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.571" offset="1782239">In July 1973, members of the General Councils for the first time in the history the tribe adapted a law and order code asserting tribal territorial jurisdiction as an Act, Code of self determination overall Indians and non-Indians in their lands within the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.505" offset="1853919">The code was not approved by the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.253" offset="1868966">Tribal crimes are defined in the code that includes not only major offenses and not only minor offenses, but also major offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.633" offset="1902507">Amongst all major offenses are assaults, burglary, theft, and rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.709" offset="1930824">At the same time, the code provides the tribal courts established in the code do not have jurisdiction over offenses within the Major Crimes Act of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.371" offset="1981397">Since the Major Crimes Act applies only to offenses by Indian offenders, the tribal court therefore, has jurisdiction under the code only over non-Indians, but not Indians for those major tribal offenses as defined in the law and order code.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.232" offset="2052868">The code established a judicial system for the first time in the history of the tribe providing for a tribal court and appellate court, where judges are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.537" offset="2090066">They must be tribal members and have no further education qualifications than having graduated from high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.667" offset="2118592">Their salaries are paid from funds in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.929" offset="2135624">At the same time we note that the members of the jury by a recent enactment of the tribe must also be members of the tribe and by being members of the tribe that means they must have 1/8th Indian Blood or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.170" offset="2200616">In August of 1973, Mr. Oliphant, a non-Indian residing on the reservation when the alleged violation took place by him on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.628" offset="2258504">For years prior to 1973, a local American legion had sponsored this event.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.950" offset="2283790">It was known as Chief Seattle Days and they also took place generally in this Ball Park area.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.627" offset="2318481">This was where the incident took place in the Oliphant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.615" offset="2346380">At that time, Mr. Oliphant became involved in altercation with campers on the Ball Park that were attending that event.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.139" offset="2388489">The record does not indicate that the campers involved in altercation with him were tribal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.931" offset="2419627">He was arrested and charged by newly appointed tribal police officers, not for the altercation with the campers, but for assaulting one of the police officers in resisting arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.940" offset="2467692">Due to lack of jail facilities, he was then imprisoned in the City of Bremerton Jail off the Reservation for five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.234" offset="2500920">Pursuant to contract that have been made by the Federal Government with the City of Bremerton for the benefit of the tribe and the jailed prisoners of the tribe.</text>

            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="1999.903" offset="8079526">Exactly and in addition there is another statutory scheme in connection with these reservations in the State of Washington which I suspect, but do not know, is paralleled in most other western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.136" offset="8140443">The Sovereignty of the United States over the area which is now the State of Washington under the concepts of sovereignty which have always been accepted in western country, in western civilization in the United States came from explorations beginning with those of Robert Gray and from a series of treaties, the Louisiana Purchase Treaties with Spain and Great Britain culminating in the treaty with Great Britain of 1846 under which we settled the northwest frontier of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.805" offset="8259144">At that point, the United States' claim to the sovereignty over the Washington area was total, absolute and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.333" offset="8293312">Moreover, two years later, the United States organized that area into the Oregon territory and the Oregon territory statute says on this subject “Nothing in this Act shall be construed to impair the rights of persons or property now pertaining to the Indians and said territory so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished by treat, rights of person or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.862" offset="8415356">Now, does this mean that the United States recognized, this is before and even the Indian Treaties were signed, criminal jurisdiction by the Indian tribes over non- Indians unlimited and subject matter in geography except by the borders of the Washington territory, I think that state that questions answers it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.424" offset="8489648">It means exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.641" offset="8498530">That the United States recognized in the Indians no powers except rights of person or property which themselves depended on that Oregon territory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.317" offset="8541162">All else was subsumed into the sovereignty of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.056" offset="8576166">In 1854, when the Trade and Intercourse Act was passed in its present form, at least for the purposes of this argument here today, the United States withdrew from Federal Jurisdictions a certain authority to prosecute both Indians and none Indians where a tribe held exclusive jurisdiction and I am quoting now “by treaty stipulations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.982" offset="8667908">Later in that same year, 1854, in full knowledge of this provision, the United States presented the treaty of Point Elliott to this Suquamish Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.624" offset="8710435">That treaty contained no treaty stipulations conferring exclusive jurisdiction over non-Indians to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.626" offset="8742409">And the next year, in 1855, the Attorney General of the United States re-stated his early opinion that Indian tribes may receive jurisdiction over non-Indians only from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.023" offset="8788071">In 1878, a Circuit Court at Ex-party Canyon held that the Federal Statue limited tribal court jurisdiction to offenses by Indians against Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.185" offset="8828718">Now, from that point on, 1878, at the latest, the judiciary, the Congress and the executive were in complete agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.972" offset="8859856">As late as 1970, the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior adhered to the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.912" offset="8883575">Indian tribes do not have criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.940" offset="8899666">True that opinion was withdrawn in 1974, but not until the Solicitor General’s brief in this case has the federal government ever expressed a contrary review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.211" offset="8936760">Now, what has happened as a result of that view, in reliance on these consistent longstanding views, literally tens of thousands of United States citizens had purchased land and settled on Indians Reservations in full confidence that they have not waived their rights to self-government and to participation in the administration of their criminal justice systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.551" offset="9026099">It seems to us far too late on the day now at least in the absence of a clear declaration of congressional intent to the United States to tell these citizens that it was wrong and that they are in the situation of any one living in a foreign country “precisely the extraordinary submission of the Solicitor General in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.218" offset="9112825">Not only a foreign country, but a foreign country in which they can never become naturalized citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.400" offset="9137589">These citizens have not chosen to live in a foreign country and they do not do so now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.815" offset="10327206">But that is one of the treaties do and I think it is important for the Court to understand this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.900" offset="10343506">The treaties established what ought to be the final homeland for Indians in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.344" offset="10365345">Anyone who is knowledgeable about Western history, certainly in our state knows, that Indians basically roam throughout the state and agreed there were no wars in the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.327" offset="10425217">Now, I acknowledge that because of the United States Government, the federal government, there is an anomaly today and that is that these Reservations, non-Indians were allowed to settle on whether to the General Allotment Act or through treaty provisions which in this case is what prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.661" offset="10486553">The allotments, the assignments of land were made to the treaty, not the General Allotment Act or whether through the opening up a reservation to settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.745" offset="10518945">The question remains now is how is this anomaly going to be dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.228" offset="10532842">I am the first to acknowledge that I think an important question the fact that people living within the reservation cannot participate in tribal government, but the question remains then which way does one go?</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.072" offset="10580280">And it seems to me that the danger to American Indian Policy and to the promises of this government in telling Indian Tribes that in choosing between these, because of this anomaly, these two alternatives that we have chosen basically to eliminate any control you might have on your reservation over non-Indian trespassers or other committers of minor offenses is the wrong way to go and is really going to harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.699" offset="10682785">Indian interest and the interest of this Court has upheld in previous cases, in recent cases much more than the harm that might be done to the non-Indian who I admit is in an unfortunate situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2700.983" offset="10883927">There were six members of Congress on the Commission and five Indians on the Commission, Indian leaders and that commission said that they find that not only as a matter of law do they consider that Indian tribes have jurisdiction over non-Indians, but because of the heinous situation in most Western States about local law enforcement from counties and states that it is necessary and is a cataloging of all the problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.675" offset="13862618">As a matter of fact, I think it is important to point out the time and period of the treaty negotiation with Point Elliott tribes of which Suquamish is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.017" offset="13896055">It is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.389" offset="13901488">A draft treaty was prepared in 1854 by the local commissioner of Indian affairs, the Governor of the Washington Territory, Isaac Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.315" offset="13933253">In that treaty, was a specific provision which said the tribe will give up jurisdiction, criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians and will have criminal jurisdiction only over its own members, a specific provision, this is in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.410" offset="13985603">That language was written by the attorney who was the Secretary of the Treaty Commission on December 10, 1854.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.008" offset="14011934">Six weeks later, on January 22, 1855, the Point Elliott Treaty was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.412" offset="14033563">The only provisions of a 15-section draft treaty which had been written for the purpose of negotiation, the only provision that does not find its way into the Point Elliott Treaty are those expressed words that a tribe will give up non-Indians -- will not have a jurisdiction over non-Indians and will turn them over to the United States for prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.915" offset="14111617">Every other provision of the draft treaty is in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.125" offset="14120394">There are even provisions which are part of the article in which this language appears which find their way into the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.657" offset="14142546">It is the only provision that is not in the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.821" offset="14151219">Certainly, I cannot tell you, I was not there, we do not have notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.798" offset="14163131">I cannot tell you that the Indians were clever enough in the 1855 to negotiate a way back because they knew what trouble would bring them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.148" offset="14188522">But some conclusion must be drawn from the fact that the commissioners at that time and this is 20 years after the passage of the 1834 Trade and Intercourse Act felt it necessary to negotiate and to put in to a treaty a provision terminating jurisdiction which Mr. Gorton says had been terminated 20 years before in 1834.</text>

            <text syncTime="3649.738" offset="14678892">It is our position, the government may have a different position, but it is our position that the Federal Government in fact would have had jurisdiction over these offenses over both Oliphant and Belgarde.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.027" offset="14716091">The only question is concurrently, can the tribe claim jurisdiction and as it occurred in the facts of this situation, employ that jurisdiction when there is no one else around to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.064" offset="14752244">You are dealing with the situation where both offenses occurred in the middle of the night.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.120" offset="14768440">You are dealing with the situation in which the County and the Federal Government were asked to provide law enforcement assistance during the tribal celebration in the Oliphant case and the county gave one deputy for an eight-hour period and the Federal Government provided no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.645" offset="14822566">Had the tribal police not affected this arrest and the tribe not persecuted it, both Oliphant and Belgarde would have gone unpunished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.775" offset="14851092">In the Belgarde case it is even worst because the tribal police basically under my instructions at the time attempted not to act in a matter which might bring about as it did, a court case and the tribal police called the state patrol and the county sheriff and asked them to come that they have now made an arrest of a person who is intoxicated and was speeding through town.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.813" offset="14943147">They came, they said well this is a misdemeanor we did not observe it and so therefore we will not be prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.919" offset="14959656">This is on the record and so you have a situation, it is the perfect situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3725.857" offset="14983376">Had that tribe not been able to make that arrest and make that prosecution who knows what destruction would have been occurred on that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.626" offset="15006468">Particularly in the Belgarde case, we are talking about an individual and a truck speeding and probably highly intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.725" offset="15030814">So, the answer to the question is, no, we are not claiming exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.496" offset="15045965">I can tell you that the US Attorney, the Federal Courts had really not much desire to get involved in neither the Oliphant nor the Belgarde cases in terms of a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.520" offset="15078043">They are relevantly minor offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.756" offset="15082954">They are two young kids and they are making some trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.843" offset="15091314">If the tribe can not do that, particularly when the other side of the offense is tribal police, tribal property, tribal dignity, a breach of the peace not just for Indians, but for non-Indians, if the tribe can not do that, what is left to them, but this homeland that has been created for them?</text>

            <text syncTime="3899.306" offset="15677188">It is going to bring an influx of 25,000 non-Indians, probably to develop that coal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3925.768" offset="15783036">So, while the Port Madison case, we admit that the tribe is still there, it has always been recognized, it has never been terminated, there is a statute, no agreement or statute doing that, the principle of law though, whether it would be civil regulation or criminal regulation can be better seen a situation like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5485.767" offset="22023062">That is quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.979" offset="22027869">Finally, to state the proposition that the state and local authorities have no interest in providing law enforcement authority for 3,000 of their own voting citizens on this reservation or perhaps, for 25,000 potential voting citizens on a reservation some place in Montana, is something nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.819" offset="22107176">Of course, the county has exactly the same interest in the enforcement of the law in this area as it does not any other area in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.494" offset="22141972">Mr. Justice Stevens asked the question of counsel as to the situation of the Indians got in 1850, after the Oregon Territory Act, but before any Indian Treaties were signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.780" offset="22195052">Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe could have asked a much broader question and received the same answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.768" offset="22215010">Under the submission of the tribes, the Indians would have had the right to seek out that scout at any place in the Oregon territory and try him for any asserted violation of its code whatsoever because of these Doctrine of Retained Sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.310" offset="22289198">We say there are at least two grounds under which the answer is no to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.186" offset="22312708">The Indians simply did not retain that sovereignty under the way in which sovereignty is considered by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.132" offset="22340502">As of 1846, by the time of the completion of the treaty with Great Britain, the sovereignty of the United States over that territory, of the United States was total.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.589" offset="22382298">When the United States in the Oregon Treaty statute sought to preserve rights of Indians, it did not talk about some kind of retained sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5584.088" offset="22416257">It said that we will not take away their rights to persons, their personal or property rights, except by treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.124" offset="22452411">Again, I say it is absurd to think that the United States blively (ph) left all of the settlers who were moving into that territory to the plenary jurisdiction of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.838" offset="22499327">Under those circumstances until they could reduce them, reduce them geographically only to a set of reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.545" offset="22526076">That is simply is not consistent with the history of the United States.</text>
