            <label>Mr. Francis J. Dimento</label>
            <text syncTime="96.150" offset="464509">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.134" offset="476421">This is here on the grant of the petition for a writ of certiorari to the First Circuit which partially vacated a judgment of acquittal entered in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.078" offset="548206">The case presents a double jeopardy issue which arises in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.534" offset="570044">In November of 1971, there were a series of raids so-called around the suburban communities of Boston, pursuant to search warrants directed to suspected bookmaking establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.832" offset="631275">The warrants were issued as the result of a series of wiretaps authorized by the District Court which have been conducted since the previous June.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.486" offset="673907">For some reason, and I do not know the reason, it was not until 10 months later in September 1972 that an indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.208" offset="712777">In this particular indictment, the one now before you, 16 persons were indicted and, eventually, 11 were tried of whom one was the petitioner, Sanabria.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.799" offset="759171">It was a one-count indictment charging a violation of Title 18 United States Code Section 1955 which, as you know, is the so-called Bookie Syndicate Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.142" offset="820506">About a month after the indictment was returned, the Fourth Circuit announced this decision in Giordano which you might recall was the case that held that a wiretap was invalid if its application for it had been authorized by a person other than the Attorney General or the specially designated assistant as required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.997" offset="927922">Then, this court granted certiorari in Giordano.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.919" offset="943595">In the spring of 1973, by agreement among all the parties including the government and the defendants, the case was allowed to lay dormant pending your decision in Giordano.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.963" offset="991765">I give you this history because there is some suggestion in the government’s brief and in the record that, for three or four or five years, defense counsel was finding ways to attack the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.640" offset="1046518">The case was essentially dormant for a very good part of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.984" offset="1063863">Eventually, in mid-1974 I believe, this court upheld Giordano.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.087" offset="1100330">As a result, many, many of the indictments that have resulted from the raids were dismissed and this was one of the few surviving indictments, if not the only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.014" offset="1144007">It became immediately apparent to defense counsel that unless we could find some other basis for a Fourth Amendment attack, there was simply no defense for these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.282" offset="1193012">There was just a ton of evidence, if all the bookmaking slips and wiretaps were going to get into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.700" offset="1238779">We did come up with some other Fourth Amendment grounds but the District Court did not see it that way, nor did the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.508" offset="1269917">Interestingly enough, we filed a petition for certiorari here which was held by you over the summer and denied just last September under the name of Plotkin, petitioner, I believe against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.340" offset="1333342">These were the 10 defendants who were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.317" offset="1345254">Sanabria was the 11th and he was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.057" offset="1360196">I am jumping ahead in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.243" offset="1376914">After the Trial Court denied our motion to suppress the evidence, we realized that the trial was going to be simply an exercise in the protection of the defendants’ rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.591" offset="1438250">Shortly before the trial began, we began casting around for some kind of defense to put on some kind of plausible defense at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.595" offset="1478269">Of course, the place to begin is with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.523" offset="1494047">The statute, if you recall, prohibits willfully conducting a gambling business that has to meet three criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.721" offset="1530828">First of all, the violation of the gambling business must constitute a violation of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.858" offset="1559354">Second, it must involve five or more persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.746" offset="1574923">Thirdly, it must be large.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.296" offset="1581087">It must be in operation more than 30 days or receive a gross revenue of more than $2,000 in any single day.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.637" offset="1622465">An essential element of the offense was to prove that the gambling law alleged in the indictment violated state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.086" offset="1652245">The indictment particularized as the violation of state law, Section 17 of Chapter 271.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.751" offset="1682965">That Section of the Massachusetts General Laws is directed to games like horse races, political election, boxing matches, but not to lottery, the numbers games so-called.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.404" offset="1733538">Thus, the government had to prove or we thought they had to prove that the business that was being alleged was one that was in violation of Section 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.417" offset="1785574">That is a non-numbers type of game.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.496" offset="1801874">At the close of the government’s case when it put Section 17 into evidence, by way of asking the court to take judicial notice of it, we made what I might charitably call a somewhat specious argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.744" offset="1862896">Because the indictment described the business as one of registering bets which is not, technically speaking, a crime under Massachusetts law, the crime is being found in a place with apparatus for registering bets.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.077" offset="1920261">But, because the indictment described the business as one for registering bets and because it described the gambling business as including a numbers operation and the numbers operation was not a crime under Section 17 which was specified in the indictment, we moved for a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.247" offset="1992882">As I say, the motion was completely unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.825" offset="2019213">We took a wild shot and the District Court was not buying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.935" offset="2039693">At the Appendix at page 7, you will find the District Court holding that the indictment was not effective in denying the judgment of acquittal on that basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis J. Dimento</label>
            <text syncTime="522.258" offset="2168947">I made a specious argument moving for judgment of acquittal when the proper motion should have been motion to dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.416" offset="2205623">That was why the argument was not well-founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.324" offset="2225267">Then after the District Court denied the motion, properly so, we got down to the serious business of directing ourselves to the evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.142" offset="2268526">We moved at page 11, I believe of the record, to strike or limit the numbers evidence so as not to be considered on the first essential element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.652" offset="2318576">That is, that the gambling business must violate state law and, in this case, violate Section 17, the horse-racing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.613" offset="2362358">What we were asking the court to do is either strike out all of the numbers because horse-racing had been particularized or limit the numbers evidence so that it could be received only as further description of the gambling and perhaps go to the state of mind of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.863" offset="2431425">That is, that they were professional gamblers and knew what they were doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.241" offset="2444905">Your point was that since the indictment had not recited in detail each of the Massachusetts statute that was thought to be violated, and a necessary prerequisite for the federal offense, this motion was in order.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.087" offset="2508330">My point was there was one statute which was particularized and that was the statue, the violation of which the government had to prove.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.657" offset="2610521">Judge Skinner, the Trial Judge, recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.882" offset="2619507">If it had simply alleged that the gambling business violated state law that would have been enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.017" offset="2643958">I think Judge Skinner said that what the government had done was narrowed it, specified Section 17, and was stuck with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.772" offset="2683037">It was a misleading contention on your part that since they did not have to specify anything but they did specify one section and, therefore, you have been more or less misled so that you were prepared to defend only as to that aspect?</text>

            <text syncTime="667.042" offset="2748134">I really did not think I had to show that I was misled or prejudiced because it is part of the due process that you prove what is charged and you charge what you intend to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.637" offset="2786482">I suppose that is part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.250" offset="2792960">But, it all goes to the fundamental right to be notified of the crime with which you were charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.996" offset="2831935">At any rate, the District Court denied our motion to strike the evidence so as to limit it and then the defendants put on some evidence and then we renewed what I would call a specious judgment of acquittal motion and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.052" offset="2888150">Then, there was a recess and the judge came back from the recess and said that he had done some research.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.695" offset="2914691">He reconsidered our motion to strike or any alternative to limit the evidence and he decided to strike the numbers evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.939" offset="2951680">He says that in page 13, “Section 17 does not include the numbers aspect, so that while I am not going to grant a motion for judgment of acquittal on that basis, I will grant the motion to strike so much of the evidence in the case as has to do with numbers betting.”</text>
            <text syncTime="737.258" offset="3029003">Then, when the dust had cleared and the numbers evidence had all been taken out of the case it became obvious that there was no evidence linking one defendant to the case in any way, linking him to the gambling business and that defendant was the petitioner here, Sanabria.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.079" offset="3092219">I did what I assumed was the logical thing to do and move for judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.097" offset="3112281">Of course, what we could have done was to do nothing at all and permit the jury to return a verdict of not guilty which it would have had to do because the judge would have had to instruct that they could convict somebody only if he were connected to a horse-racing gambling business and the jury would have, under those instructions, done the right thing, I assume.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.190" offset="3500669">I am sure if I had, by way of request for instruction, asked the Trial Judge to instruct the jury that they are not to convict anybody who was shown merely to be who was not in the horse business, he would have, when I made that request for instructions, said to me “you damn fool!Why are you not moving for judgment of acquittal?</text>
            <text syncTime="874.886" offset="3579455">I am not going to send this case and sit around until a jury decides up there in the jury room that there is no evidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="882.880" offset="3611429">He would have, I suppose, sue sponte entered the judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.409" offset="3633580">I do not think of myself as waiving anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.129" offset="3652493">The judgment of acquittal was allowed and then the government filed this notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.452" offset="3673705">I would say the notice of appeal of the First Circuit is the first time and the only time the government correctly described what happened, because it says the United States appeals from a decision in order of the District Court excluding evidence and entering a judgment of acquittal and denying the motion for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.988" offset="3751863">There had been a motion for reconsideration thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.855" offset="3763357">Then in the second paragraph of its notice of appeal, the government says it is hereby certified that the evidence suppressed constitutes the substantial proof of the charges against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.587" offset="3810273">Obviously, the government was trying to fit this in to that part of the statute which permits it to appeal from an allowance of a motion to suppress evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.007" offset="3847994">The net result really as to what happened here was that there was an erroneous ruling on the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.408" offset="3869518">It pains me to say that the ruling was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.621" offset="3878400">I thought it was right and I still do.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.124" offset="3884460">But, that is not before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.502" offset="3889894">The First Circuit has decided it was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.141" offset="3900447">There was an erroneous ruling on the evidence, but a correct ruling on the state of the evidence in granting the motion for judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.004" offset="3939945">This characterization the Court of Appeals and the First Circuit holds is in accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.029" offset="3964082">That court holds that the critical ruling by the District Court was that the indictment failed to charge a violation of Section 1955 on a numbers theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.461" offset="4009744">That is at footnote 5 of the court’s opinion at page 6 of our Appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.274" offset="4040986">But, may it please the court, that can be said of almost any erroneous ruling excluding evidence as irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.374" offset="4077453">When a court decides whether evidence is to be admitted or not, it must necessarily interpret the scope of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.704" offset="4110785">If it interprets the scope widely, it will permit in more evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.750" offset="4130952">If it narrows the scope, it will narrow the amount of evidence that comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.716" offset="4154776">But, when it excludes evidence on the basis of irrelevancy, that exclusion is no more appealable than if it erroneously excluded evidence because it was incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.912" offset="4207543">Here, the Court of Appeals says not that the indictment was dismissed but that it was effectively dismissed and not that evidence was excluded but that the charge was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.742" offset="4266893">It speaks of excluding the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.527" offset="4278074">The Court of Appeals says, and this is adapted by the government, that the numbers charge was a discrete basis for imposing criminal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.446" offset="4317675">This discrete basis was effectively dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.844" offset="4335334">We have here what I respectfully consider to be a new vocabulary introduced in to the criminal law.Indictments are divided into counts as we all know but now, under the law of the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit, counts are to be further divided into discrete basis of liability, which I call in my notes DBLs, discrete basis of liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.846" offset="4559360">Discrete basis of liability, my shorthand expression for the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.732" offset="4582870">The Court of Appeals, however, puts a limit on this DBL kind of theory by saying that you can have a DBL that has constitutional double jeopardy significance only where the count is duplicitous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.269" offset="4636996">That is, the DBL must be one of the offenses contained in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.724" offset="4654864">The government takes a more extreme view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.515" offset="4670015">Because the government concedes that the First Circuit was in error when it held that this particular indictment was duplicitous, it now must take the position if it is going to claim successfully to this DBL theory, it must take the position that a DBL must still be treated as a separate offense for purposes of double jeopardy analysis even though the count is not duplicitous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.047" offset="4792163">So that under the government’s definition, I think it is possible to isolate several DBLs in this indictment in this one count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.788" offset="4827063">As a matter of fact, DBL recognition will become a very important part of the skills of every defense lawyer because his failure to recognize a DBL could have drastic double jeopardy consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.269" offset="4877009">But in this particular count, the charge is that the defendant accepted, recorded, and registered bets on horses and numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.033" offset="4912118">You have accepting bets on numbers, recording bets on numbers, and registering bets on numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.991" offset="4935941">You have got three DBLs there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.871" offset="4943465">Then, you have got skill, speed, and endurance of horses, and yet accepting bets on the skill of the horse and recording bets on the skill of the horse and registering bets on the skill of the horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.440" offset="5001665">It just keeps going on and on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.723" offset="5010860">You might get into the hundreds of these DBLs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.325" offset="5029251">It seems to me that if you are going to incorporate that into our law, it should be prospective because, Lord knows, nobody really recognizes this theory up until now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.051" offset="8680124">After the District Court denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence, the defendants then argued that the indictment failed to state any offense involving numbers betting, although it clearly did so, on its face, because it referred to Section 17 of a particular Massachusetts statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.619" offset="8758387">This section, they argued, referred mainly to horse betting and that Section 7 referred to numbers betting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.139" offset="8784509">After the District Court initially denied this motion, it agreed and concluded that the indictment did not adequately charge any offense involving the taking of numbers bets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.726" offset="8834874">Having effectively struck through with the charge on the face of the indictment charging numbers bets, the District Court then excluded the numbers evidence as irrelevant to what remained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2270.210" offset="9160777">Nevertheless, the District Court adhered to its ruling and concluded that the indictment would not be read as stating any offense involving numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.027" offset="9200065">With the numbers theory removed, the District Court then turned to the evidence with respect to horse betting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.346" offset="9225352">It found that this evidence was insufficient to show that Mr. Sanabria was involved in the gambling enterprise and it acquitted him on what remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.825" offset="9263282">The Court of Appeals held that this was the equivalent of dismissing the indictment in so far as it charged engagement in accepting numbers bets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.581" offset="9302256">It further held that the District Court’s disposition of the numbers betting portion of the indictment was not an acquittal because it had nothing to do with relating the evidence to the elements of the offense or to the defining the elements of the offense, but was simply a conclusion that the indictment was insufficient on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.164" offset="9380624">The court then remanded for a second trial with respect to the gambling offense to the extent to the gambling offense involving numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.415" offset="9409567">To the extent involving horse betting, there was indeed an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.067" offset="9424196">The Court of Appeals held, and we agree, that we could not retry petitioner on that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.670" offset="9454603">Petitioners argued that the Criminal Appeals Act does not authorize the appeal that the United States took.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.027" offset="9484069">This court has held, however, that the Criminal Appeals Act authorizes any appeal from a final judgment unless the double jeopardy clause bars the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.336" offset="9517296">We believe, therefore, that the only question this court need confront is a constitutional one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2493.284" offset="10053120">It would have been open to petitioner then to move before trial to strike through that language as incorrect or inconsistent or, in some other way, inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.902" offset="10099514">Our argument is that since he did not do so, he then opened up the possibility of a second trial that would otherwise not have needed to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.555" offset="10142145">I will get to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.357" offset="10149355">The second argument which was an alternative argument is that the District Court’s decision here removed the numbers charged from the case of petitioner’s request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.696" offset="10194704">When the District Judge granted a judgment of acquittal, all that was left was horse betting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.323" offset="10217274">The case, therefore, is not significantly different from last term’s decision in Lee which held that a defendant could be retried after an indictment had been dismissed in mid-trial at the defendants’ request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.496" offset="10269936">The first argument has to do with the timing of petitioner’s motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.749" offset="10290939">Rule 12b3 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that objections to defects on the face of the indictment be raised before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.350" offset="10333362">The argument that the indictment which concededly recited that petitioner engaged in a betting offense involving numbers did not actually charge that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.510" offset="10377979">It is an attack on the insufficiency of the indictment and, therefore, was required to be raised before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.593" offset="10402325">We have collected at note 23 of our brief some authorities that support this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.196" offset="10428761">Petitioner, therefore, was not entitled to have his contention resolved during trial at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.493" offset="10449868">Not having attacked the indictment before trial, the judge was required to treat the charge as sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.722" offset="10474841">The court did consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.991" offset="10483931">In considering it at all that it erred in petitioner’s favor, the timing of the motion was petitioner’s choice and the judge did reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.091" offset="10520294">It gave him the relief he requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.548" offset="10530116">In doing so it erred a second time, as the Court of Appeals now has held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.512" offset="10549969">In other words, this case is here because of a result of two errors that the District Court made, each induced by petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2767.153" offset="11148591">Then, I suppose, under the theory of the case that the Trial Judge actually adapted, the Trial Judge would have been obligated to grant a motion for judgment notwithstanding the acquittal and notwithstanding the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.808" offset="11187148">Had that scenario taken place, would you contend that such an order by the Trial Judge would also have been a dismissal?</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.270" offset="11233019">Let me answer that in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.171" offset="11240647">First, your hypothetical case is a case that this court has already decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.526" offset="11257992">It is the case of Foreman against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.221" offset="11268859">In 361 US, the court held that a second trial was permissible in that case because the jury did return a verdict of guilty in the teeth of the evidence, as the judge defined it, because the judge wrongly removed from the jury’s consideration, the correct theory on which it could and should have convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.864" offset="11347435">The second answer is that if that kind of thing had happened in this case and the jury had in fact acquitted instead of convicting, that it would not have been an acquittal on the charge to the extent it involved numbers evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.288" offset="11413055">Our view is that the numbers charge was removed from the case well before the judge granted an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.837" offset="11443252">When the judge effectively said that there was no numbers charge at all because the indictment was inadequately stated, that took the case out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.011" offset="11475958">What was left was a horse betting charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.623" offset="11486407">Whether the District Judge acquitted it, acquitted by himself or sent it to the jury, and the jury returned a verdict of acquittal is, in our view, a matter of detail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.026" offset="11520052">You would say even if there were a jury verdict of acquittal that because of the erroneous exclusion of the evidence that it should be treated as though the indictment had been dismissed on this DBL.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.756" offset="11878975">The defendants’ interests were fixed by the reason that the judge terminated the case and not the means by which he did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.710" offset="11910740">That, I think, is the rationale underlying the distinction between dismissals of the indictment and mistrials on one hand and true acquittals on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.829" offset="11943236">It has to do with the reason why the case terminated and not the form that the judge used to make that termination come about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.758" offset="11970926">The reason this case terminated with respect to the numbers offense was simply that the defendant succeeded in persuading the court that the indictment was bad on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.354" offset="12025365">The purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to avoid multiple trials at the request of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.014" offset="12048039">It guards against repeated prosecutions brought to embarrass the defendant, to subject him to anxiety, to increase the chance of conviction of an innocent man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.727" offset="12090880">But, the premise of this rule is that it is possible to have guilt reliably determined in a single trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.167" offset="12120555">When guilt can be determined in a single trial, holding of two trials is pointless and an offense against the defendants’ rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.951" offset="12155768">But, when the premise of this rule does not hold true, the court has allowed second trials in order to produce a single fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.647" offset="12190563">For example, there can be a second trial after a tainted conviction has been reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.594" offset="12214283">There can be another trial after a mistrial has been granted because of manifest necessity or even in the absence of manifest necessity because the defendant requested it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.368" offset="12253362">There can be another trial as in Lee, when an indictment has been dismissed at the defendants’ request because of a defect on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.915" offset="12287634">In other words, when the first trial is flawed, a second trial may be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.176" offset="12308637">When a defendant moves to abort his case before a verdict, a second trial may be held even if the first one was not flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.824" offset="12339252">In these cases, it cannot be said that the prosecutor deprived the defendant of his valued right to obtain the verdict of the jury at his first trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3570.146" offset="14360503">Your honor, the motion that in our view is the material one was not the motion for the judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.386" offset="14389447">It was the motion to take the numbers theory out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.707" offset="14406792">Once that had been done, the acquittal followed quite naturally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.172" offset="14424660">But, the dispositive point in our view is the time at which the numbers theory came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.562" offset="14442214">Let me suggest an analogy that we use in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.850" offset="14459350">Suppose this indictment had been in two counts, and we understand the petitioner does not contest that it could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.249" offset="14484950">One count charging conducting a gambling enterprise by taking horse bets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.161" offset="14504594">The other count charging the conduct of the gambling enterprise by taking numbers bets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.161" offset="14524552">The District Judge would have done two discrete things here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.837" offset="14539285">He would have charged that the first count of the indictment charging the taking of numbers bets was insufficient on its face and dismissed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.557" offset="14578155">Then he would have submitted a second count to the jury, the second count dealing with the taking of numbers bets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.313" offset="14601143">The jury would have acquitted on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.739" offset="14610860">In our view, this is the same case as that hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.336" offset="14625280">It makes no difference to the defendants as far as double jeopardy interests are concerned, whether there was one count or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.063" offset="14648163">Although in our view once the horse betting count went to the jury, that is a final un-reviewable disposition of the numbers argument, it does not do anything</text>

            <text syncTime="3668.858" offset="14755370">Certainly not, your honor, but I think it is agreed at least between the parties here that a two-count indictment in this case would have been proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.510" offset="14785985">I think, in so far as the Double Jeopardy Clause is concerned, it does not make any difference whether it is in one count or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.526" offset="14810018">In Greene against the United States, at 555 US page 190 note 10, the court took up exactly this kind of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.647" offset="14854531">The question in Greene was whether it made a difference in part that first and second degree murder had been expressed in one count rather than two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.040" offset="14892147">The court said the situation is the same as though Greene had been charged with these different offenses in separate but alternative counts of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.977" offset="14923807">The constitutional issues at stake here should not turn on the fact that both offenses were charged to the jury under one count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.169" offset="14952647">The same is true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.307" offset="14961215">The constitutional issue should not turn on the fact that both theories of liability were charged in one count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.396" offset="14985561">The interests of the defendant are the same either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.319" offset="15001234">The issue on which the District Judge eventually entered its judgment of acquittal had only to do with the numbers betting theory of liability, excuse me, it had only to do with the horse betting and not numbers betting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.939" offset="15047732">If I make that mistake once more, it is going to be exceedingly embarrassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.131" offset="15064451">I repeat that the problems here are largely of petitioner’s making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.844" offset="15079288">There was no fatal flaw in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.503" offset="15089946">The first trial was not infected with error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.247" offset="15100918">The petitioner took a perfectly adequate trial, brought it to a halt, persuaded the judge that he had not been adequately charged, and aborted the trial without obtaining the verdict of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.843" offset="15147311">All of this was unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.176" offset="15156611">The timing was petitioner’s choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.906" offset="15167582">The error was introduced at petitioner’s urging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.816" offset="15183151">We, therefore, believe that because he urged the District Court twice, once in timing and once in taking the numbers offense out of the case, he should not now be entitled to absolute immunity from prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.979" offset="15247830">We, therefore, believe that the Court of Appeals correctly held the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar petitioner’s second trial.</text>
