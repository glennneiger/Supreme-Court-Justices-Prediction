            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We'll hear arguments first his morning in Number 1690, Parham against several minors.</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Douglas Lackey</label>
            <text syncTime="21.825" offset="190673">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.735" offset="202271">The cause of this case is here for reargument and I realized that the court is familiar with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.613" offset="225782">With the court's permission I would like to begin by simply setting the issues before the court and proceeding directly to my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.649" offset="253994">At issue in this litigation of course is the constitutionality of the Georgia's statute which recognizes the rights of parents of mentally ill children to make application for admission for those children to state mental health facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.853" offset="310836">The statute was attacked on essentially two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.991" offset="323375">The appellees argued that children have a constitutionally protected liberty interest and that this statute which authorizes their hospitalization without prior notice in hearing deprives them of that liberty interest for that due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.071" offset="383666">Second, the appellees argued and the District Court found that children who are mentally ill and who receive treatment from the state have a constitutional right to receive treatment for their mental illness and only that treatment setting which is most appropriate to their condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.514" offset="453465">Turning to the first issue, the foremost and threshold question which should have been addressed in the District Court and wasn't was an examination of the interest sought to be protected to see whether in fact it has a constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.576" offset="509680">That is, do children have a constitutional right to challenge the medically indicated decisions of their parents?</text>
            <text syncTime="108.948" offset="539146">What the District Court did was simply look and see that parent's makes decisions or their children and as a result of this decision-making process, that often times the child is subjected to potentially grievous injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.033" offset="591496">Here, hospitalization as the District Court characterized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.180" offset="604139">And what he said was -- what the District Court said was, is that because of the injury here this children or this parental decision making process can only be done in a constitutionally permissible fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.755" offset="658369">We submit that this is the point where the District Court made the error upon which its entire opinion was predicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.347" offset="684805">It is our position that a proper analysis of this case should have begun with the parent-guardian and child relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.459" offset="717197">It's our position that based on this Court's previous decision as well as the history of our western civilization that we have decided and by we, I mean society and not the state, that we have decided that there are certain decisions that children cannot make for themselves, that there are certain decisions that an adult has to make for a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.183" offset="796087">And among these decisions are medically indicated decisions with very few exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.201" offset="820224">That is, it's our position that in our society parents with the advice of a physician routinely make decisions which range from whether a child is to have a tonsillectomy to decisions which have life and death consequences for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.347" offset="888769">One example which I'd like to use is the situation where the parents faced with the child who has a heart defect, the young child.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.270" offset="928475">And a doctor says of course the child can live without an operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.716" offset="946239">The child will be an invalid for his or her entire life.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.145" offset="959927">I can operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.726" offset="966301">If the operation is successful, the child will live a normal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.690" offset="982183">If the operation is not successful, the child would die.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.652" offset="993991">That kind of decision, that kind of life and death decision-making process occurs in the family routinely and yet no one has ever suggested that that kind of a decision which clearly could have the consequences which are much more adverse that what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.026" offset="1055431">No one has ever suggested successfully except in a few recent District Court decisions that that kind of a decision-making process is required to be subjected to an advisory proceeding such as what was mandated here by this District Court decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.296" offset="2908557">It's our position that in this case, what we have is we have private parties here, parents availing themselves of a resource from the state which is substantially identical to a resource which could be provided and could be obtained in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.671" offset="2970102">And that it is -- perhaps we can best state it by saying illogical to have a decision where the result is simply to create two classes of parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.056" offset="3011584">One class of parents who buy their wealth or buy reason of their wealth and their assets and the finances that they have can go to a private facility and can avoid all of the process which has been mandated by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.719" offset="3074278">And have another class of parents who because of their poverty or their inability to pay and who are therefore forced to rely upon the state for their -- treatment for their children, that these parents have to go through an adversarial proceeding such as that mandated by the District Court in order to simply obtain mental health treatment for their child.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.655" offset="3154004">Of course this has another aspect too.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.578" offset="3165706">The essence of state action here if you find it is that the hospitals, the state facility and that the physician who is -- the psychiatrist in this case but the physician who is authorizing the admission is a state employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.757" offset="3222444">If that is sufficient to create state action, then this means that in all of our public hospitals in the state of Georgia as elsewhere that the admission of any child to a state hospital for any reason is state action and the question thereafter always be whether the risk of deprivation that flows from that is sufficient to warrant some sort of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.676" offset="3306036">And of course numerous medical treatments as I have indicated previously have potential consequences which are certainly as grievous as this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1748.762" offset="7098389">Yes sir, as long as I can caveat that by saying we admit at the request of the parents but only after our doctors have said, “The child is mentally ill and suitable for treatment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.069" offset="7139662">There is another part of that test and that is of course the benefits of the adverse procedures advocated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.342" offset="7164740">I think that we have addressed them on our brief unless the court would like me to discuss them because I would like to turn just briefly to the other issue and that is the question of the District Court's mandating that we provide treatment for these mentally ill children in only the most appropriate treatment setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.637" offset="7225971">The -- what the District Court found because we told the District Court that there are certain children who are in the hospital, who are mentally ill but for whom there -- are conceivable other types of treatment settings, group homes and this sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.563" offset="7289605">Going from this, the District Court mandated that we -- the discharge these children, in particular this 46 but of course it applies to all children similarly situated, either discharge these children from our custody or provide for them the most appropriate treatment setting conceivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.181" offset="7352090">That is the best treatment setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.161" offset="7364002">I bring this to the court because we think this is perhaps as important as the other issue, maybe even more important because what the District Court has said in essence is that if I or anyone takes their child to a state mental health facility and the doctor there says, “You're child is sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.926" offset="7427114">I can treat your child here in the hospital and he'll get benefits from it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.272" offset="7444459">But if I had my preference, I'd like to have him in a group home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.556" offset="7457625">And there isn't any group home for that child and under this District Court decision, that child cannot be admitted to a state mental health facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.657" offset="7486046">And of course if we have no group home, we can't go there which means it's going to be under this decision in our opinion and we think it's an escapable conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.950" offset="7519169">There are going to be children who are mentally ill who are not going to get treatment for their mental illness in a timely fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.318" offset="7544665">The record is absolutely clear that we provided these children with the most appropriate treatment setting which we had available at the time, that is there was no finding and no evidence that we have wrongfully kept many child in the hospital when we had another treatment setting which anyone thought or physicians thought were more appropriate for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.471" offset="7617285">This mandate by the District Court is simply going to result in us being unable to serve the children to the limited extent that we already do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.692" offset="9158092">I believe that you asked me the questions to whether the Georgia procedures are invalid under the District Court's holding even as to those children who were within the American Psychiatric Associations' four criteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="2290.328" offset="9264671">What I meant to say to you there was, is that under the APA standards, all of the children under the present Georgia law are in indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.145" offset="9311901">And therefore, the APA's position is that all of those children would be entitled to hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.383" offset="9340949">And that secondly, the District Court did not deal expressly with the other three criteria that the APA set forth although I see nothing inconsistent in what the District Court's order was from those other criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.996" offset="9407404">Now, I personally have some problems with the specific four criteria that the APA set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.298" offset="9432586">But I guess the bottom line is, no, the District Court decision is not inconsistent with the APA position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.807" offset="9478562">The three issues that I would like to deal with, is first in the circumstances of this case that is, commitment of a child to a mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.819" offset="9530598">Does the doctrine of parental autonomy or family unity or however that doctrine may be characterized, does this preclude additional protections for the child?</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.471" offset="9585246">Secondly, does the process at the institution itself adequately protect the child or is there a need for more procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.907" offset="9622967">And thirdly, will the procedures ordered by the District Court Act as a reduced to have risk.</text>
