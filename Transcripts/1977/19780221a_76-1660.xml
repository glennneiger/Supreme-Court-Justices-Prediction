            <label>Mr. Garner L. Taylor, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="68.335" offset="353791">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.120" offset="368942">This case presents fundamental issues for the Court's consideration, involving the Eighth and Eleventh Amendments to United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.529" offset="402588">The case arose out of litigation concerning the operation of the Arkansas prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.269" offset="429546">A number of petitions that had been filed by inmates in the prison system were consolidated by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.708" offset="455355">A counsel was appointed to represent them and an amended and substitute complaint was filed, seeking relief under title XXXXII of the United States Code, Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.814" offset="495792">There are three issues which we ask the Court to consider. First of all, whether Congress in passing the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 abrogated the State's Eleventh Amendment Immunity and thereby authorized an award of Attorney's Fees to be paid from the funds of a State Agency, that was not made a party to the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.567" offset="594744">As a corollary to this first argument, we suggest that even if the Court should find that Congress did abrogate the State's Eleventh Amendment Immunity that, that Act should not be given retroactive application in this particular case because it would work in manifesting justice. Secondly, we ask the Court to consider whether the Eleventh Amendment bars an award of attorney's fees based upon a finding of bad faith, against the State or State Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.363" offset="721908">Finally, we asked the Court to consider whether the lower courts were correct in ruling that indefinite punitive confinement of recalcitrant inmates is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.300" offset="781677">The opinion of the District Court was entered on March 19th of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.702" offset="799335">It is found at page 141 in the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.568" offset="814800">It awarded, the District Court awarded an attorney's fee of $20,000 to court appointed attorneys for the inmates and ordered that that fee be paid from the funds of the Department of Correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.242" offset="861507">Now, the Department of Correction had never been made a party to the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.334" offset="877807">The action was filed, of course, a 1983 action can be filed directly against the State under Court decisions, the action was filed against the Correction's Commissioner and the Members of the Board of Correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.021" offset="944576">The Court held that such an award would have only an ancillary effect on the State Treasury, citing this Court's opinion in the case of Edelman v. Jordan.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.381" offset="986059">Furthermore, the Court found that the award was justified under the bad faith exception to the American rule which was discussed by this Court in its recent opinion in Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.017" offset="1040602">The Eighth Circuit affirmed this award and noted in its opinion that subsequent to the District Court's decision, the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 had been approved, that Act was approved on October 19th of 1976 and the Eighth Circuit held that the award of attorney's fees was proper under that Act and was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment Immunity of the State Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.143" offset="1153033">It is our contention that the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 did not operate to abrogate the Immunity of the State of Arkansas to monetary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.684" offset="1215205">Because in passing the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 76, Congress did not amend Section 1983 of Title XXXXII to include a State within the meaning of the term person.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.704" offset="1271316">Therefore, the threshold fact of Congressional authorization which this Court found present in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, was not present in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.768" offset="1315619">The State was not a party to the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.543" offset="1326695">The Department of Correction was not a party to the action and in effect the Court lacked jurisdiction over this Department of Correction and had no jurisdiction to order an award of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.682" offset="1379254">In Fitzpatrick, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had been expressly amended, to subject Governments and Governmental Agencies and political sub-divisions to suit under that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.205" offset="1429304">But the present case -- in the present case, 1983 was not specifically amended and this case more closely resembles the decision in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Department, a case in which this Court held that Congress had not abrogated the State's Immunity because it did not specifically amended Section 16 (b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act to include a State within the meaning of the term, any employer, when it enacted amendments in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.639" offset="1551035">Even if Congress had tried to abrogate the State's Eleventh Amendment Immunity in passing the Act it failed to do so, because when Congress acts to abrogate a State's Immunity in a unilateral fashion, that is without a waiver on the part of the State, pursuant to the Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, when Congress acts to abrogate a State's Immunity pursuant to Section 5, it should do so in explicit statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.829" offset="1667854">The legislative history of this Act does not need to consulted because there is no ambiguity on the face of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.952" offset="1708292">If --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="410.347" offset="1721876">Certainly, some of our cases have gone sufficiently as far as so as say that you look at everything you can in construing the statute, rather than the more traditional role, perhaps a while ago that only where the legislative language is unclear, do you resort to the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.236" offset="1793451">I mean -- it seems to me if you look at the legislative history, the committee report in this case, it seems that the Officer's Committee Report pretty clearly thought that they were going to impose attorney's fees against Governmental Bodies, do not you think so?</text>

            <text syncTime="444.339" offset="1857817">Yes sir, but it is our position that Congress simply misinterpreted the decision of this Court in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer and Congress did not do what they had to do to abrogate the State's immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.028" offset="1908599">They did not amend Section 1983 to include a State within the meaning of the term person.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="466.576" offset="1946842">Well, is your point that, even if Congress had enacted the language that you find in the committee reports, it would have been insufficient or that the committee reports are not sufficiently weighty so as to affect the language that Congress did choose to enact?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="490.018" offset="2040570">It is our position that the committee reports -- of course the Court can look at them and consider them, but there is really no need to because there is ambiguity on the face of this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.916" offset="2100129">If Congress was so certain that they had effectively abrogated the State's Eleventh Amendment Immunity, it seems strange that there is now Bill pending in the Senate, Senate Bill 35 which will specifically amend Section 1983, to define the term person as any individual state, municipality or any agency or unit of Government of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.793" offset="2667717">The legislative history does indicate the intent of Congress to abrogate Your Honor, but it is our position that Congress, even though it may have tried to abrogate the State's Immunity simply botched the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.303" offset="2733755">They simply did not do what they had to do to abrogate the State's Eleventh Amendment Immunity because here we are dealing with some very fundamental constitutional issues in a very delicate balance of the relationship between the States and our National Government and our system of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.682" offset="2799270">The Eleventh Amendment is fundamental to that relationship and it is our position that when Congress acts to abrogate that immunity, it should do so in explicit statutory language, so there will be no confusion as it is now across our country as to whether or not States are liable for attorney's fees under the provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.746" offset="2887459">If Congress had acted by enacting a Statute with explicit language, there would not be the kind of confusion we see right now and in this case there is no waiver by the State of Arkansas, no waiver expressed or implied in Edelman v. Jordon.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.996" offset="2968439">This Court held that the Eleventh Amendment barred an award of retroactive benefits under a Federal State Program for the aged blind and disabled and the term ancillary effect was discussed by the Court in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.664" offset="3019117">Ancillary Effect refers to the fiscal consequences that a State may expect in complying with injunctive relief granted by a Court in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.255" offset="3081497">It is a perspective effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.983" offset="3100410">For example, in this particular case, an ancillary effect of the District Court's decree might be the fact that the State of Arkansas had to spend over half a million dollars to build a new maximum security unit, but an ancillary effect would not be the award of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.752" offset="3167492">That would be a direct effect upon the State Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.534" offset="3186614">So the District Court's determination that the award of $20,000 in attorney's fees was an ancillary effect is misplaced under the decisions of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.525" offset="5442548">That is correct sir and under the present statute, the State indemnifies the officials for actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.934" offset="5472223">There is no mention of attorney's fees in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.649" offset="5495107">If this Court in Newman v. Piggy Park Enterprises recognized that a major purpose of providing for an award of attorney's fees was to encourage litigants to bring suits vindicate the public interest, a very valid reason, but as to pending cases, such an incentive is unnecessary because the case is already in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.113" offset="5592909">So it seems to us that perspective application of this Act will accomplish this goal while at the same time enabling the States to better prepare for the increased financial burden that maybe placed upon them in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.858" offset="5663962">Our third point that we want the Court to consider, is whether the lower courts were correct in ruling that indefinite punitive confinement is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.901" offset="5732090">Punitive confinement is employed when an inmate simply will not abide by the rules of the institution to recalcitrant inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.542" offset="5778692">They have stripped him of other privileges, denied other benefits in minor disciplinary proceedings and it is generally employed in instances where there is an escape or an assault on someone or a refusal to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.163" offset="5845148">This point does not concern the conditions of the confinement, but only the duration of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.292" offset="5881614">The District Court found that the procedures employed in the disciplinary proceedings were consistent with the decision of this Court in Wolff's V. Mcdonnell and the Court also made specific ruling so that the inmates now have no more than two in a cell at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.046" offset="5960713">They have clothing, same diet, regular diet as the other inmates with the exception of dessert, they do not get any dessert.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.340" offset="5997807">They are entitled to a shower three times a week, but the District Court ruled that they could not be held in punitive confinement for more than 30 days and it is our contention that this was erred on the part of the District Court and the Eight Circuit in placing a limit on the amount of punitive confinement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.481" offset="13494428">The named party was the Arkansas Department of Corrections in the case that I referred to Justice Marshall and the second ground is that the award of counsel fees is authorized by the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Act of 1976 which was adopted in response to Alyeska under Fitzpatrick and under the -- with a proper congressional exercise of power, not with the magic words amending, to say that we can say a named, that State may be sued, but the legislative history is quite clear, quite explicit that the Congress intended that States pay these fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.442" offset="13674254">The Senate report is cited at page 78 of our brief as is the House report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.735" offset="13699437">Both of which are quite clear that these fees assessed against officials are to be collected from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.662" offset="13735172">And representative (Inaudible) report makes it clear or his statements make it clear, quoted at page 81 of the brief, that it is an enactment pursuant to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.623" offset="13790970">There is no doubt what the legislative history in this case provides and that is that the States are to pay these awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.002" offset="13844468">That $20,000 that the State says will be such a catastrophic on it, was assessed for three lawyer for two-and-half to three year's work in one billion dollar budget and it is clearly ancillary if anything is ancillary, the State paid over $500,000 to build the East Building in response to what the judge required and here we are not dealing with a catastrophic award, a fees is so going to seriously dehabilitate the State ability to function in that year or in any other year.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.367" offset="14037983">With regard to the point made concerning our State statute requiring the Attorney General to appear, I would refer the Court to Ford Motor Company v. Department Of Treasury, a similar statute was involved in that particular case, it is in the footnote left of the Court's decision and in that case it was held that there was no waiver by the virtue of the fact that the Attorney General appeared and defended the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.344" offset="14161908">I believe this Court acknowledged the fact when it decided the landmark case of Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, it was breaking new ground that -- and setting forth the means by which Congress can act pursuant to Section 5 with the Fourteenth Amendment and abrogate a State's Eleventh Amendment Immunity without a wavier, express or implied on part of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.543" offset="14286669">The Court acknowledged that it was making new law and we urge the Court to adopt the position that when Congress acts pursuant to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment it must do so in explicit statutory language and urge the Court to do decide in this case and to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
