            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Kilcarr</label>
            <text syncTime="46.438" offset="265667">Good morning, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.086" offset="272250">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.934" offset="283640">Your honors, in early 1969 and shortly after the discovery of oil on the North Slope of Alaska, planning commenced to build a pipeline that would reach from the Arctic Ocean in the location of Prudhoe Bay, 800 miles South to the Port of Valdez on the Gulf of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.777" offset="379039">After overcoming numerous engineering design and environmental obstacles, the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, indeed, TAPS was constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.370" offset="433373">TAPS is a unique feat of engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.544" offset="454062">Alone, it costs $9 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.876" offset="467437">But, it is unique also, Your Honors, because it took two Acts of congress to get it started, the Alaska Native Claims Act which settled aboriginal land claims by Alaskan natives and, of course, the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline Authorization Act passed in November of 1973 which effectively disposed of that massive environmental litigation which had delayed the project from its very inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.566" offset="586242">The TAPS situation, Your Honors, is also unique because the regulatory treatment afforded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.328" offset="613200">It was subjected to an unprecedented rate-making and suspension water.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.901" offset="643502">I say unprecedented because there is nothing like it in the 90-year history of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.498" offset="673909">To put that order and the activities of the ICC in perspective, one point should be emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.554" offset="698151">That is, though in fact, this is a single pipeline, it is, in law, eight separate pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.684" offset="730647">This results from the decision on the part of the owners to form an ownership of the line on the basis of undivided interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.308" offset="769204">So that as a result, we are looking at eight common carriers that are required under the Interstate Commerce Act to fill the capacity of their share of the line as common carriers and, thus, are subjected to all the responsibilities of the Act as well as all of the rights given to a common carrier under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.539" offset="866066">In that context, the eight owners of the Trans Alaska Pipeline formulated their independently calculated tariffs for submission pursuant to Section 6-1 of the Interstate Commerce Act in early June.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.853" offset="943388">For example, Mobil Alaska filed its tariff on June 10th to be effective June 20th and, at the request of the ICC, it postponed the effective date until the 30th of June.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.973" offset="991871">The point to be emphasized here, and at this point, is that the calculation of these eight separate tariffs all followed a methodology that had prevailed in the industry for 35 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.402" offset="1045579">It is referred to repeatedly in the briefs as the Consent Decree approach to rate determination, which is referenced to the Atlantic Refining case that was settled by Consent Decree in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.101" offset="1096361">It was in Elkins Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.398" offset="1105556">The case was or the aspects of that formulation were before this court in 1959 in Atlantic Refining versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.261" offset="1149024">Very basically, what that Consent Decree requires is that owners of pipelines can receive no more than 7% of their share of the valuation of the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.519" offset="1205971">That is an effective limitation on what can be paid out of the rate of return of the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.983" offset="1239826">That is how these rates were independently calculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.148" offset="1260515">Following submission of the tariffs, again, pursuant to Section 6-1, there occurred the issuance of an order by the ICC in indicating that on June 27th a summary proceeding to consider possible suspension of the tariffs would be conducted by that agency and that, contrary to past practice, the entire commission would sit en banc in the proceeding and not a Suspension Board or some Intermediate Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.529" offset="1390082">The issuance of that notice of summary proceeding resulted in four protests being filed in writing with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.325" offset="1437207">One by the Justice Department, another by the State of Alaska, one by an organization representing Alaskan natives, and the fourth protest by the ICC’s own Bureau of Enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.680" offset="1478689">The protestants requested suspension of the filed rates, investigation of those rates, and the setting of interim rates in recognition that it would be contrary to the public interest to shut the line down.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Kilcarr</label>
            <text syncTime="376.367" offset="1585373">We assumed at that time, Your Honor, it was recognized by all that the situation had no financial impact, that is, no impact on the end price of the oil, if you would, that the price of Alaska North Slope oil was not going to change as far as the refinery and, ultimately, the consumer for petroleum products based upon this tariff dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.217" offset="1676802">We are at trial right now in the rate proceeding before the FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.180" offset="1696655">In that proceeding, we have had intervention by one public interest group, but there was none during the regulatory phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.366" offset="1733436">The Interstate Commerce Commission held their summary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.306" offset="1753184">It was characterized or described by the agency as an oral argument and, that, indeed was what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.752" offset="1774918">It took place on June 27th and, in that connection, the owners of the line through their representatives had opportunity to try in very summary fashion to defend the calculation on the basis of their rate submissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.538" offset="1838134">At the same time, there was opposition in that argument to any authority on the part of that agency to suspend these rates or to set interim rates during the seven months suspension period.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.594" offset="1882333">The very next day, on June 28th, the ICC issued its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.698" offset="1902709">In that order, it purported to do and, indeed, in fact did four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.359" offset="1921413">It suspended the rates as filed by the carriers, set them for investigation, set interim rates as to which the carriers could file on one-day’s notice, and those interim rates were substantially, in the case of my client, 23% less than the rate as originally filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.441" offset="1993720">In addition, they established a refund provision in the order, making the filing of the interim rates conditioned upon the carriers’ undertaking to pay back the difference between either the filed rate, the interim rate, or whatever rate was ultimately determined to be the reasonable rate in accordance with the investigation ordered in the same order.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="501.106" offset="2084312">At this point, can I ask?</text>
            <text syncTime="503.753" offset="2094970">How far in advance of the startup time were these tariffs filed?</text>

            <text syncTime="509.815" offset="2119212">In the area of June 10th and the startup time, the actual loading of the first tanker in Valdez was July 31st, Your Honor.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="519.042" stopTime="525.066">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="519.042" offset="2156097">Would it have been possible for your tariffs to have been filed, say, seven months ahead of its startup time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_kilcarr" startTime="525.066" stopTime="755.116">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Kilcarr</label>
            <text syncTime="525.066" offset="2180234">Realistically, no, Your Honor, because this was a new entity and new service.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.838" offset="2195280">The line was under construction and one had to wait until at least they had some reasonable basis to determine what their operating would be and what their construction cost would be, all for purposes of casting the rate base for purposes ultimately of determining what rate of return in accordance with the Consent Decree formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.676" offset="2274693">Admittedly, when the tariffs were filed, that information was still estimated but it was better more sophisticated degree of estimation and it would be seven months in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.464" offset="2325788">After issuance of the June 28th order, petitioners sought review and reversal in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.386" offset="2353478">A divided panel of that Circuit found, principally, that the suspension provision of the Interstate Commerce Act had no plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.610" offset="2398409">This is Section 15-7 and the court’s majority found that since there was no plain meaning to the language of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.115" offset="2432368">That, indeed, the agency did have suspension authority and further, although the court was troubled, it appears by the setting of these interim rates concluded or reasoned that this indeed did not constitute the setting of an interim rate but, rather, was the exercise of a limited waiver of discretion on the part of the agency that did have suspension authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.083" offset="2544276">The dissenting judge, Circuit Judge Roni, characterized the order, in our opinion respectfully, Your Honors, it was for what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.364" offset="2581370">He said that it was a rate-making order and, as a rate-making order, it was unlawful and it did not comply with the rate-making procedures and provisions explicated in Section 15-1 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.080" offset="2652214">On that basis, he would find the order unlawful and he did not have to consider the question of suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.925" offset="2683666">We are here, Your Honors, on a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.745" offset="2694951">As I said, we are already at trial commenced on the rate proceeding in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.379" offset="2721491">Since that time we have, of course, received from this court a stay of the June 28th order.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.573" offset="2746255">That was on October 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.011" offset="2752002">A subsequent order was ordered superseding, but not effectively changing the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.452" offset="2773736">That second order was on November 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.883" offset="2787424">Your Honors, as to the suspension or alleged suspension authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission, now of course, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, because jurisdiction over oil pipelines has been transferred to the Department Energy Bill or Act to FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.601" offset="2874360">We have analyzed in detail, Your Honors, in our brief the conclusion arrived at on the basis of the analysis of the Section 15-7, its language, the underlying Legislative History of that statutory provision, prior cases by the agency dealing with suspension situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.478" offset="2973834">In that analysis very summarily, Your Honors, we point out the essential linkage between suspension and Section 6-3 of the Act which requires 30-day notice being filed before any changes in rates and it is the essence of our position that Section 15-7 is limited to changes in rates or tariffs or practices affecting rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.510" offset="3157945">That is exactly our position, that the existence of a prior rate is what allows the continuity of service, the maintenance of status quo when the suspension takes place, and the proposed change or, literally, the new rate is examined for reasonableness by the agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.672" offset="6370588">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.746" offset="6382918">The points that I would like to address myself to are independent of your decision on the suspension power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.958" offset="6419803">Like Judge Roni, I will assume, for purposes of my argument, that the commission did have power to suspend the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.025" offset="6451986">It is our position that the order is still unlawful because of the prescription of rates and the imposition of the refund conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.901" offset="6483542">We start off, I think, with less disagreement on certain fundamental parts of the law among the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.426" offset="6513635">Our opponents concede that you cannot prescribe a rate under 15-7 or 15-1 without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.248" offset="6540907">They argue that there was no prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.688" offset="6554699">The court below held expressly that its imposition of refund conditions did not arise under the power in 15-7, which is expressly limited to increases in rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.009" offset="6611960">They found both the power to state the interim rate and the power to impose refund conditions not only on the interim rate, but on the originally filed rates to arise as valid corollaries of the suspension power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.965" offset="6671832">Our opponents here not only support that but say, if they had the suspension power, that is the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.967" offset="6695760">You cannot look at what they did under those valid corollaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.147" offset="6712479">To submit that there is plenty of law in this court and elsewhere that you cannot review a refusal of the commission to suspend because this court has held that courts have been deprived of the injunctive power in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.127" offset="6776427">But, I find no case that says you cannot review an exercise of suspension power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.513" offset="6797951">I think that statute makes it clear because it says if the commission refuses to suspend, it does not have to say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.490" offset="6825850">But if decides to suspend, it has to state the reasons therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.055" offset="6840165">To me, that is consistent with review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.360" offset="6853331">Here, the commission itself has said that when you set the interim rates, they did not set them with regard to anything that was going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.243" offset="6880916">The only period in which they could apply, the interim period, will not let back for reconsideration and they said “we know these rates are going to be right for the interim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.814" offset="6919160">We knew that when we did it and we know, even more strongly now, that your pump station eight is off and you will not have any throughput, but that does not matter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.691" offset="6954686">Yet, our opponents say “you cannot review that kind of an interim rate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.433" offset="6989690">Even if they have had a decent rate, it would be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.676" offset="7010693">The sole reliance for the power to prescribe and the power to impose refunds is on the Chesapeake and Ohio decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.075" offset="7048205">The court below and our opponents interpret that decision as saying “you cannot impose any kind of a condition you want.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.676" offset="7082686">on but to refuse to exercise the suspension power?</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.766" offset="7098987">When, of course, we started off here, they did not refuse to exercise the suspension power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.992" offset="7115914">They exercised it, they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.483" offset="7125840">But, clearly, this court did not give the Interstate Commerce Commission or its successor, the Federal Energy regulatory Commission, that kind of a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.317" offset="7161158">The Chessie case has got to be one of the narrowest decisions that has come from this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.203" offset="7184773">All that you did was the obvious thing of telling railroads came in and asked for a 10% increase in rates, and admitted they could only justify 3% of it on the basis of cost and they wanted the other 7% to catch up on deferred maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.150" offset="7252587">That if it was all right for the commission to tell them that if they were to get the money, they had to spend it for what they said they wanted it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.278" offset="7277037">That, certainly, is not a rate-setting decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.892" offset="7287486">The carriers set the rates themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.178" offset="7296681">The commission did not alter their rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.808" offset="7303160">They accepted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.501" offset="7309951">I think the difference between that case and what we have here is made clear by reference to a couple of other decisions, one of this court’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.653" offset="7354569">In SCRAP I the appellants or the respondents were attempting to convert the carrier-made rates there and the commission-made rates by arguing that the commission had imposed a condition on the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.753" offset="7426980">In that case, there was another general rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.152" offset="7436593">They asked for an emergency 2.5% increase until they could get around to filing selective rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.790" offset="7463133">The commission attached to that a condition that they include an expiration date so that those rates would expire when the selective rate increases came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.926" offset="7507646">This court said that was perfectly reasonable and did not convert those carrier-made rates into commission-made rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.706" offset="7534813">A decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that came out on March 13th, it is number 75-2143, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was dealing with a request that they imposed a condition on a rate that they had a right to set.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.728" offset="7610882">It was a rate for voluntary wheeling of electricity, moving electricity from one system to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.279" offset="7637005">Richmond Power Company said “that is great,” but hold that rate to be unreasonable unless the carriers agree to continue wheeling even involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.625" offset="7682458">The commission looked at the statute and looked at the history, and said “Congress expressly declined to give us the power to impose involuntary wheeling and, therefore, that kind of a condition is unlawful.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.052" offset="7736165">That is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.562" offset="7742226">Congress expressly denied the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the power to set a rate without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.815" offset="7779215">It expressly refused to give them the power to establish refund conditions except in the case of increased rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.419" offset="7805651">These are wholly beyond their power and you cannot, as this court has said so many times, do indirectly through conditions which are expressly prohibited from doing directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2182.095" offset="8808335">Before turning to the questions of statutory construction and the details of Legislative History that are the centerpiece of this case, I want to address two themes of petitioners’ argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.417" offset="8853579">These themes run through and appear to be the foundation for almost all of petitioners’ particular contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.481" offset="8885867">The first theme is that petitioners have been treated unfairly by the commission and that there must be some remedy for unfair treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.399" offset="8917527">The second theme is that the only legitimate use of the suspension power is to preserve the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.557" offset="8946157">The suspension here did not preserve the status quo, petitioners say, and so there must be something wrong with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.457" offset="8977713">The arguments based on unfairness fail, we believe, at the outset because the court does not have any authority to review suspension orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.554" offset="9018151">That was the holding of Arrow Transportation Co. and the holding of SCRAP I.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.535" offset="9038108">Congress entrusted to the commission the decision whether to suspend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.476" offset="9053886">The only question that may be raised here is not whether the suspension was fair or not, but whether there was statutory authority to suspend original or initial rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.725" offset="9334859">That decision was, by the way, cited by the court with approval in SCRAP I.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.998" offset="9355966">But, I need not maintain the broad position about un-reviewability in order to demonstrate the difficulty with petitioners’ arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.366" offset="9381357">The suspension here is no more unfair to petitioners than the suspension of an increase in rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.899" offset="9407584">In either case, the carriers lose the difference between what they want to charge and what the commission by exercising the suspension power allows them to charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.294" offset="9449067">That difference in this case was approximately 20% of the rates that the carriers wanted to charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.084" offset="9692319">But, I think I can go a little further than that too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.099" offset="9704335">Suspension proceedings in their nature involve a balance of considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.608" offset="9726382">Somebody loses in a suspension case no matter what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.323" offset="9741220">The shippers and the public may lose, perhaps irreparably, if rates are too high and are allowed to go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.448" offset="9769746">Congress’ perception that shippers and the public would often lose was the reason why it gave the commission the suspension power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.867" offset="9795450">On the other hand, the carriers may lose if rates are unnecessarily or improvidently suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.535" offset="9818125">Nothing can avoid the fact that someone is hurt, whether rates are suspended or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.333" offset="9837246">The Attorney General of Alaska will discuss at greater lengths how high rates hurt Alaska and why the suspension power for initial rates is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.651" offset="9870578">But, my point is that petitioners’ contention that they were aggrieved by the suspension is just one-half of the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.133" offset="9896492">It is, therefore, not a sufficient reason to study it in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.960" offset="9915822">Finally, it is hard to see how the commission acted unfairly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.346" offset="9929302">The commission accepted all of the carrier’s data about the costs that they invested in building the pipeline even though those data are subject to very short dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.458" offset="9965769">It accepted the carrier’s contention that the appropriate period of depreciation is 25 years even though 35 years is the commission’s ordinary period for computing depreciation of oil pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.079" offset="10012267">The commission accepted the carrier’s disputed contentions about income tax considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.089" offset="10032329">It afforded the carriers a 10% return on valuation even though the commission’s standard practice with respect to pipelines is 8%.</text>

            <text syncTime="3516.933" offset="14147659">My response as to why the language is different is that Congress, in 1920, simply does not appear to have thought about the differences in the language but, that it does not appear to have used them in different ways in light of the way it treated that same language in the Motor Carrier Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.758" offset="14554960">Our position, Mr. Justice White, is that we need not devote full attention to it here because the commission’s order can be sustained quite fully on the grounds that it gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.855" offset="14603339">My submission so far has dealt with the problem of the suspension of initial rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.582" offset="14622252">If the commission can suspend rates, and we think it follows that it can announce some lower rate that it will not suspend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.387" offset="14653494">The purpose of suspension, as I have said, is to prevent the charging of a price that appears to be too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.965" offset="14675751">It is not at all to stop the carriers from offering a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.246" offset="14692887">In order to determine what is too high, the commission must have at least a tentative view of how to distinguish excessive rates from permissible rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.664" offset="14730608">In stating reasons for suspension, the commission may decide and announce how it made that decision, how it established a tentative line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.406" offset="14769582">It revealed here that the rates appeared to be too high because the carriers had used an improper method of computing the rate of return on investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.625" offset="14802392">If it had stopped there, petitioners could have figured out for themselves what rates they could have charged that will be low enough that the commission would not suspend them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.686" offset="14838650">The commission performed that chore of the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.864" offset="14851398">Petitioners seem to think that the commission did too good a job of thinking through why their rates appeared to be too high and announcing its reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.299" offset="14885148">But, it will be bizarre if the commission could proceed within the law only by concealing the reasons for its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.592" offset="14910330">Its statement of reasons should not expose it to a charge of illegal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.198" offset="14928720">Petitioners say, though, that this is rate-making without the formal hearings required for rate-making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.023" offset="14952022">If the commission is having a good reason for believing that particular rates are too high is rate-making, then I suppose this case is rate-making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.440" offset="14985667">But, that does not carry petitioners very far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.325" offset="14993191">It is more a play on words than an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.239" offset="15004893">Congress authorized the commission to suspend rates and required it to have reasons for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.484" offset="15025896">The commission complied fully with the statutory requirement of having reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.680" offset="15042614">Petitioners’ attempt to hang a phrase on that decision does not do anything to impeach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.216" offset="15064766">But we do not, however, agree that this is rate-making as that word is understood within the meaning of Section 15-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.850" offset="15091307">The commission has opened a full investigation in the petitioners’ rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.747" offset="15106876">The rates will be made after full hearings that are now in progress before FERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.357" offset="15125370">They will then be subject to full judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.438" offset="15137700">This case concerns only the rates that were to be charged during the first seven months, months now gone by.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.418" offset="15165599">Congress clearly created, in the suspension power, a special control that could be exercised during those seven months without regard to the more formal proceedings with Section 15-1 that Congress knew consumed more than seven months to carry out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.882" offset="15227457">The entire reason for having a suspension power is that rate-making cannot be completed in seven months and certainly cannot be completed before rates go into effect in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.894" offset="15271551">Petitioners’ argument, that their rates during the first seven months were influenced by the suspension power and by the fact that the commission announced what made it think that the rates were too high, is nothing but a resurrection of their result of the suspension power itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.691" offset="15338738">If, as we argue, the commission can suspend initial rates all together, it can relax that suspension by stating reasons and allow lower rates during the first seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.178" offset="15384609">The final argument here concerns the refund condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.551" offset="15398193">This condition, we think, should be sustained for the same reason that the court upheld the commission’s decision in Chessie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.424" offset="15425674">The condition is intimately related to the reasonableness of the rates during the seven-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.577" offset="15458275">The commission was willing to take the carrier’s assertions about investment depreciation and the like at face value, only if it could be sure that any error in the carrier’s favor allowing the collection of excessive rates would eventually be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.188" offset="15516685">The commission was concerned about the level of the rates and if a refund condition were unavailable, the commission might well have been unwilling to approve rates even as high as those that are allowed to go into effect without suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.639" offset="15574467">This court has held that the Federal Power Commission, which lacks a general power to order refunds, may condition the grant of the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity on the carrier’s willingness to make refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.222" offset="15628802">The case in which it did that is United Gas Improvement Company against Callery Properties, 382US.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.790" offset="15655133">The court said, indeed, that a refund condition was essential to protect the public and that it could be made a condition even though Congress had been unwilling to provide the commission affirmatively with that power</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.367" offset="15701422">.This court, itself, imposed a refund condition when it allowed petitioners to collect the rates that the commission had suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.870" offset="15731411">The principle is really the same here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.315" offset="15741233">The commission could have suspended outright and it can protect the public by conditioning non-suspension on the carrier’s agreement to refund rates later determined to be excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.365" offset="15785432">In sum, the commission has used its suspension power for the purpose it was created to serve, to protect the public from rates that appear to be excessive and to do so during the seven months before a more thorough study can be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.515" offset="15841961">This purpose applies to the suspension of original rates in just the same way as it applies to the suspension of any other rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.375" offset="15869442">This purpose explains why the commission can allow lower rates to go into effect, once rates that have not been too high have been proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.926" offset="15903610">It demonstrates why the commission legitimately may request the carriers to agree to refund rates determined to be excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.892" offset="15935480">The same purpose underlying the suspension power explains everything the commission did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.611" offset="15954392">Its decision is, therefore, correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3996.673" offset="16066614">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.586" offset="16082288">The court has already spent a great deal of time on discussing whether or not Section 15-7 which applies to new rates only really applies to changed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.714" offset="16126800">I had intended to spend my time primarily on the interim rate question and the refund provision, which attended the ICC’s suspension of rates in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.231" offset="16164835">However, before leaving the question of statutory interpretation, I would like to make one very simple but I think important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.393" offset="16201511">Section 15-7, on its face, is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.246" offset="16224916">The language says that you may suspend a new rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.494" offset="16241948">I think under any common interpretation of the word “new,” this is a new rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.910" offset="16267548">The discussion in this court has focused primarily on other portions of the statute or other portions of other statutes, Congress enacting an amendment in 1920, Congress adapting legislation in 1940, and Federal Power Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.701" offset="16346751">In my capacity, I worked with the state legislature a good deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.188" offset="16372665">It is asking, I think, a good deal for a legislature to be internally consistent within a lengthy Act all by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.199" offset="16412685">It is asking even more when you ask that subsequent legislatures, 10 or 20 years later, approaching the question from different points of view and in different statutes to be equally as consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.082" offset="16464302">You can probably prove a lot or nothing through reference to subsequent statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.180" offset="16500665">If the interpretation of this statute on its face, 15-7 and if “new rates,” meaning new rates, led to some illogical or strange result, it would seem to me that that interpretative process would be a very valuable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.135" offset="16564508">But, here, the statute makes eminent sense as it was originally written.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.042" offset="16584152">If you interpret “new” as only meaning changed, what you are really ending up with is a statute which protects the public for a substantial amount of its business and leaves the public absolutely defenseless for the filing of initial rates or new rates absolutely defenseless.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.149" offset="16672551">Certainly, the public needs the suspension power in the ICC, as this case so clearly demonstrates, certainly as much for new rates as it does for changed rates and the carriers are in no worst position when new rates are suspended than when changed rates are suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.404" offset="16761576">For when a carrier files a changed rate, by definition, it is asserting that the rate which it is changing is unreasonable and is leading it not to make a reasonable profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.408" offset="16813612">So, suspending a changed rate leaves the carriers in no worst position than they claim they are here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.471" offset="16841824">What I am suggesting is that simply taking the sentence as it was written and interpreting it in its normal fashion will lead to an extremely sound and logical result.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.328" offset="16885292">If you stretch and reach for an unusual result, you will arrive at a system which leaves a whole area of regulation open.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.900" offset="16927506">For the remainder of my argument, I would like to focus on the suspension power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.711" offset="16942761">I am going to assume that the court will hold that there is a suspension power over newly filed rates and focus on whether the interim rate procedures used in this case, and the refund provision adapted it as a condition to filing interim rates, was a valid exercise of the ICC’s power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.335" offset="17025308">The question simply stated is whether the commission’s actions were directly related to its power to assess the reasonableness of rates filed before it and to their power to suspend rates pending an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.509" offset="17081942">To analyze that relationship, you have to understand a little bit more about the background of these proceedings because if you do, it not only shows the soundness of the statutory interpretation which was urged earlier by Easterbrook.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.178" offset="17132619">But also, that both of the procedures used by the ICC when it suspended rates and suggested a level of interim rates which would accept and require a refund provision are not only rationally related to their review function but absolutely necessary to the exercise of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.868" offset="17215375">I am here, of course, as a representative of the people of Alaska who, for the last three or four years, have undergone what we at Alaska laughingly refer to as pipeline impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.953" offset="17259783">Pipeline impact, roughly defined, is inflation, increased crime, housing shortages, and crowded classrooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.537" offset="17290085">These are caused by rapid infusion of people into a state with no facilities to handle them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4314.255" offset="17337001">The Arctic Slope Native Corporation, which is not here today but represented in part by myself, had it even worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.186" offset="17364691">They suffered not only the things I spoke about, but they suffered cultural dislocation on the Eskimo community in the North Slope.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.009" offset="17395933">Traditionally, that type of impact is met by socialite action of one sort or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.986" offset="17419862">To do that in Alaska, we need money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.140" offset="17432505">The money comes from the oil and, thereby, lies the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.832" offset="17455284">The money that comes to the State of Alaska from the production of oil comes from its royalty and its severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.985" offset="17479839">Both of which are based on the wellhead value of the oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.982" offset="17491855">The wellhead value is inversely related to the cost to transport the oil to market.</text>

            <text syncTime="4432.794" offset="17811071">We replied before the commission that that was totally unsatisfactory for two reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="4447.217" offset="17868854">We had an immediate need for the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.809" offset="17879199">We had suffered impact for years.</text>

            <text syncTime="4474.522" offset="17978046">We felt that reparations would be inadequate and a risky remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.843" offset="17999258">Legally, it is extremely risky.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.186" offset="18008662">Traditionally, in reparations cases, of course, the shippers seek the reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.715" offset="18026843">But here, as the court has undoubtedly noticed, there does not seem to be much of an outrage from the shippers for the costs of shipping this oil down the pipeline which is not terribly surprising since the people who own the oil who are shipping it own the subsidiaries who operate the pipeline.</text>

            <text syncTime="4990.755" offset="20042973">Correctly so that the statutory plan, the congressional plan, calls for reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.121" offset="20068469">I would like to come back to the Chief Justice’s question because what has intrigued us every time that question has been asked is the other side of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.593" offset="20106294">If you assume suspension power, as our opponents do, could the commission set a rate for the transport of that oil at, say, $1?</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.015" offset="20156031">The answer in those circumstances, and they have answered that question affirmatively before the Fifth Circuit, is yes, they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.260" offset="20188946">Where does the balancing come in?</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.090" offset="20196260">I suggest respectfully that the balancing comes in when we are dealing with a rate established in the first instance or an original rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.247" offset="20232936">That the agency does not have authority to suspend that rate and to the extent that the hearing which does take place after it is filed, to the extent that the hearing finds that the rate was excessive, then the shipper has the right of reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.717" offset="20314856">If on the other hand and what destroys this delicate balance, if on the other hand the agency asserts authority and suspends and then finds that interestingly the rate that was filed was a correct rate within the zone if reason, the carrier has no way to recover the moneys lost as a result of that suspension and as a result of that interim rate being set so low.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.104" offset="20432302">That, we consider to be the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.239" offset="20444841">The Attorney General has made what is essentially an equity argument, talking about the need for money now in the State of Alaska and not wanting to wait until a reparations determination has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.023" offset="20503982">But, the situation for the carriers, Your Honors, is that if we were right and we believed we were right and we did not overreach when we prepared and filed those original tariffs for the period July 31st through October 20th, when the stay of this court was entered, we will never recover that money.</text>

            <text syncTime="5191.365" offset="20845351">It had never questioned that formulation and it is a formulation that was exposed to this court, and found to be a reasonable interpretation of the Consent Decree that was entered in 1941.</text>
