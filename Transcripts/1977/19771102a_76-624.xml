            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="59.477" offset="317807">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.727" offset="338809">This is a federal income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.170" offset="352602">It comes here on a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed a judgment for the taxpayer in the United States District Court for Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.363" offset="409340">The question involved is the effect of a sale lease-back transaction, involving a bank building between the petitioner Frank Lyon Co. as leaser and the Worthen Bank &amp; Trust Company as lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.729" offset="490842">Before stating the facts, I would like to place them in context by briefly indicating the basic approach which we take in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.885" offset="539430">In planning a substantial business venture of the sort involved here, taxpayers should be able to predict the tax consequences with some degree of certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.790" offset="591048">To this end the tax collectors should avoid applying the tax laws to frustrate bona fide bargains unless he can point to some reason for doing so which is pragmatically based in tax policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.589" offset="654264">This does not mean that taxpayers should be allowed to manipulate tax consequences with arbitrary labels or with maneuvers which have no economic substance, but neither should the tax lawyers be a joker in the deck for a business planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.657" offset="738587">In a situation where ownership is inevitably divided and that is true of most business property.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.188" offset="772651">No transaction can be safely planed if its tax consequences are made to depend on an abstract comparison of the ownership of bundles of sticks which various parties carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.090" offset="832315">The policy for which we argue is in effect that there should be a presumption in favor of taxing bona fide business transactions as they were bargained, structured and understood by the parties, particularly whereas here there is no realistic tax policy reason for scrambling the bargain which was made between Frank Lyon Co. and the Worthen Bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.925" offset="979645">No, Your Honor that is not question they were independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.792" offset="995110">There is one -- the President of Frank Lyon Co. is a director of Worthen Bank but the Court found that they were independent and that is not now contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.375" offset="1045474">Worthen Bank in Little Rock for many years in 1967 add a capital of $4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.482" offset="1081836">It decided to build a new building and it was able to obtain a desirable site.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.384" offset="1101480">It retained an architect and build a public parking garage on an adjoining track.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.487" offset="1137843">The total project would cost about $12 million of which about $1,500,000 was the cost of the land and $7,500,000 was the cost of the bank building on this particular piece of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.902" offset="1211508">The bank sought approval for the financing of the building from the State Banking Commission of Arkansas and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="329.271" offset="1396977">The Lyon paid essentially the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.553" offset="1414114">There was a contract by which Lyon agreed to pay not in excess of $7,640,000 and that is the exact amount which they paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.419" offset="1453611">They were advised by the banking authorities that Worthen could not legally own the building either directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary at a cost in excess of the amount of its capital stock which was then $4 million and that is Section 25 (a) of the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.934" offset="1527694">In addition to this legal obstacle there was also a practical barrier, Worthen Bank had planned to have a $5 million conventional mortgage and to issue $4 million in debentures, but Arkansas law forbade Worthen from paying more than 6% on debentures and the bond simply were not marketable at that rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.216" offset="1620795">In this situation, Worthen sought both legal and financial advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.287" offset="1641066">It consulted a number of potential investors and lenders including Goldman Sachs &amp; Company and Eastman Dillon, Union Securities Company of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.066" offset="1680249">It also made preliminary contact with the First National City Bank of New York for interim financing and with New York Life Insurance Company for a long term loan on the completed building.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.558" offset="1730195">In the course of these discussions, the suggestion was made that the practical and legal problems could be solved by a sale and leaseback with an independent buyer and leaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.811" offset="1787142">After these discussions were well underway, Frank Lyon Co. decided to enter the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.725" offset="1822878">Lyon as, I have said is an independent company, thought its Chairman, Frank Lyon is a director of Worthen Bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.351" offset="2017333">I see.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="487.781" stopTime="790.938">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="487.781" offset="2031021">Frank Lyon Co. underbid the other potential buyers by reducing the rent payable by Worthen for the building by $21,000 a year for each of the first five years and on this basis Frank Lyon Co. was accepted by Worthen as the investor owner and Lyon was approved by the financing agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.114" offset="2124435">After extensive further negotiations, Lyon entered into a number of agreements both with Worthen and the financial institutions and there was first a ground lease by which Worthen leased the land to Lyon for a term of 76 years and 7 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.126" offset="2204475">That was actually a year and seven months for a construction and 75 years after the end of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.155" offset="2232582">The idea for leasing the ground had been suggested by some of the New York financiers as a way of simplifying the ultimate transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.695" offset="2278767">There was secondary sales agreement by which Worthen sold the building to Lyon and this is interesting but I do not think readily significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.094" offset="2316279">Bit by bit as it was built for a price not exceeding $7,640,000 as each piece of material was incorporated in the building, it was sold to Lyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.212" offset="2364762">Now, this was adopted because Worthen Bank could not own banking premises in excess of its capital and if it built the whole building and then sold it they would have violated the law and also because Worthen Bank was not subject to the Arkansas sales tax on the materials which would have amounted to something like $125,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.525" offset="2458071">Finally, there was a building lease by which Lyon leased the building to Worthen for a term of 25 years subject to two sets of options.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.947" offset="2499763">There were first four options to purchase the building at stated figures, at the end of the 11th , 15th , 20th and 25th years of the lease and the basic term of the lease, the original term of the lease was 25 years and then there were eight options to renew the lease, beginning with the 25th year for consecutive five year periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.214" offset="2612821">If all the options to renew or exercise, Worthen Bank would occupy the premises for a total of 65 years, but that still after a term of ten years at the end,where Lyon’s ground lease would continue and it would have full entitlement to the building no matter of what.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.190" offset="2696726">The transactions became effective on May 1st 1968. During the construction period, Frank Lyon Co. borrowed the money to finance the cost from First National City Bank of New York in the amount of $7 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.301" offset="2765167">It did this on its own note on which it alone was liable, when the building was completed Frank Lyon Co. discharged this obligation to First National City Bank and to Worthen by putting in $500,000 of its own money and by borrowing $7,140,000 from New York Life Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.411" offset="2873627">Again, Frank Lyon Co. alone signed this note.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.702" offset="2894734">Worthen was not a party to it although Worthen did join in providing additional security for the note by mortgaging the parking garage and the land to which it still owned the fee and also consenting to an assignment of the lease to New York Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.323" offset="2969235">After Lyon had borrowed the $7,140,000 from New York Life, it paid off its debt to First National City Bank and had $500,000 of its own invested in the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.620" offset="3030466">The Government has made much of the fact that the rent for the first 25 years under the ground lease was fixed to $50.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.508" offset="3065993">There was some confusion in the record about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.381" offset="3077487">The lease itself says $50 for the term at one place in the finding that says $50 per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.717" offset="3106848">I think $50 for the whole term is correct I do not think it is of any importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.143" offset="3128478">However the amount of this rent is entirely irrelevant, whatever rent was fixed for the land during the initial 25 year period would inevitably be taken into account in determining the rent for the building during this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.335" offset="3193261">If the rent to the land had been fixed at $100,000 a year, then for simple economic reasons the rent for building would have been increased by $100,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.115" offset="3236416">It was a large transaction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="864.590" offset="3538287">At which Lyon was liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.842" offset="3547273">Yes of course Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.856" offset="3559394">After the first 25 years, as I have just said the ground lease provided for substantial and increasing rents payable by Lyon over the next 40 years aggregating $7,500,000 and for the final ten years of the lease, a reduced ground rent of $10,000 a year was provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.231" offset="3652912">The Government contends that it is inconceivable that Worthen would walk away from the building at the end of 25 years or at any subsequent time, but it is clear that these escalating ground rents were designed to deal with precisely this eventuality, if it were a foregone conclusion that Worthen would continue to rent the building throughout the entire 65 year term ground rentals of up to a quarter of a million dollars a year would not have been necessary just as in the first 25 years which were binding on the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.472" offset="3781852">Lyon also had the absolute right to all the improvements made by Worthen to the building at any time the building lease terminates, Lyon comes into full possession of the building and all its pertinences.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.755" offset="3834933">And this shows a significant benefit of ownership for Lyon and operates as well to negate any inference that the parties never contemplated Worthen relinquishing control of the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.349" offset="3893343">Now, the ground lease must of course be considered together with the building lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.540" offset="3914137">The rent payable by the bank during the first 25 years of the building lease exactly put Lyon in funds to meet its liability to New York Life on a quarterly basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.477" offset="3965859">Thereafter as I have said, the bank had eight successive options to renew the lease for five year periods, and the rent for such periods is fixed at $300,000 per year and by that time Lyon has no longer any obligation to the financial institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.620" offset="4050391">Under the building lease, Worthen Bank had four options to purchase the premises at the end of 11, 15 and 25 years, these options and the purchase price appeared at page 419 of the Appendix they are substantial amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.086" offset="4128236">If Worthen exercised anyone of these options to purchase, both the building lease and the ground lease would terminate; however, if Worthen did not exercise the option to buy, the ground lease would continue in full force and Frank Lyon Co. would be liable for the aggregate of $7,600,000 of rent ado for the 50 years remaining under the ground lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.380" offset="4249444">In this respect the Government has significantly misstated the situation in a footnote on page 13 of its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.494" offset="4289882">I am sure that this was unintentional, but it is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.278" offset="4313079">The Government says there that and “the ground lease would terminate if Worthen did not renew the building lease” and as I have indicated this is not true, the Termination Clause is paragraph 9 on page 369 of the Appendix, under this the ground lease would terminate on the exercise of one of the options to buy under article 20 of the building lease, but there is no provision for termination of the ground lease on the failure to exercise one of the options to renew the building lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.037" offset="4480053">If the options to renew expire at anytime between the 25 and the 60 year of the lease, Frank Lyon remains liable for the rent stated on the ground lease including the rental stipulated for the final ten years of the lease and during all of this period or potentially 50 years, if an option to renew is not exercised Frank Lyon Co. is the unqualified owner of the building able to deal with it in anyway it thinks desirable, lease it to a new tenant, replace it, sell it or occupy it itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.962" offset="4659776">This is not a lease which provides for a bargain purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.301" offset="4681092">The price is payable if Worthen exercises the options to buy are substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.655" offset="4706587">The trial court has expressly found on evidence that “from page 304 of the Appendix, there has never been any understanding or agreement between Worthen and plaintiff that Worthen will ever exercise any of its options to purchase” and the trial court also found and this actually appears at three places in the findings but the quotation I gave is also on page 304, the Trial Court found that it is most unlikely and improbable that Worthen will exercise its options to purchase at the end of the first 11 years of the lease or at the end of any of the subsequent option periods.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.382" offset="5861513">This of course is a question of assuming up to 25 to 65 years in advance what interest rates will be involved, but I think the real difference is a flown away of reasoning that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.424" offset="5941657">It is said that it will only cost Worthen Bank $50,000 to occupy this building in the later years because the rental is $300,000 in the later years but the ground rent is $250,000, but that ignores the fact that Worthen can walk away and still get the $250,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.682" offset="6026711">Frank Lyon is liable for the rent on the ground lease whether Worthen renews the lease at all or not, so the real question is whether it is advantageous for Worthen to occupy the premises and in contrast to moving away some place else, opening a new building and collecting $250,000 a year from Frank Lyon on the old one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.264" offset="6225033">There are various reasons why Worthen might not wish to keep its bank there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.836" offset="6243319">The banking community might move away to other parts of the city as it has in various places and this was suggested by the President of Worthen Bank in the evidence in this case with the development of electronic fund transfer, the whole nature of banking may change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.426" offset="6309670">You may have simply outlets and department stores and things and your bank may be out in a suburb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.810" offset="6343211">Between the two, it is clear that the option to renew is probably, mathematically more advantageous than the option to buy, but it still does not follow that the option to renew the lease will be exercised and if the option to renew is not exercised, then Frank Lyon remains liable on the ground lease for various substantial amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.301" offset="6449164">Now, the Government says that Frank Lyon is a mere conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.911" offset="6463583">It relies on the fact that the rental payments from Worthen to Lyon are exactly the same as the amount due from Lyon to New York Life on the long term, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.552" offset="6506110">That simply means that they were not concerned with immediate cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.796" offset="6527113">What it means is that they were looking for protection on return to a combination of tax benefits in the early years or they could use as provided by law double declining balance depreciation and also to profitable operation potentially in the years following the 25 year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.647" offset="6658561">I have talked mostly about depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.791" offset="6667129">Let me talk briefly about interest deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.625" offset="6686460">I do not see how there can be any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.672" offset="6702656">Section 163 of the Code provides that there shall be allowed as the deduction all interest paid or accrued in the taxable year on indebtedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.444" offset="6741735">Here Frank Lyon Co. an independent entity was indebted to First National City Bank and New York Life on its notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.833" offset="6775276">It borrowed the money and it paid interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.774" offset="6787084">Worthen did not borrow the money. Worthen was not liable on the notes and did not guarantee the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.993" offset="6811952">It did not pay interest under the statute it seems to me clear the Frank Lyon Co. should be entitled to deduct the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.322" offset="6857196">Lyon is not a finance company, it was a an entrepreneur in this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.029" offset="6884050">It invested a substantial amount of its own money and it undertook large liability on its notes and on the ground lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.284" offset="6917069">With reason and with the advice of counsel both parties proceeded on the understanding that Lyon is the owner of the building and is entitled to the depreciation deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.070" offset="6960223">There is no reason in fairness nor in the terms of the Internal Revenue Code, why Lyon should not have the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.737" offset="6990839">There is no need to take the deduction away from Lyon in order to protect the revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.772" offset="7011005">There is, I venture to say, no real justification for a system which says that the depreciation and interest deductions in such a case as this must wait until the final decision of the highest court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.013" offset="7072027">Here, if it had been known that Worthen was entitled to the deduction as in effect held by the Court below despite the fact that Worthen could not legally be the owner of the building then the parties could have bargained accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.741" offset="7130855">The rent would necessarily have been that much higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.851" offset="7147364">It is important in a case like this, a three-party case, not a case like some of the others where they are just dealing with a finance company and in the Sun Oil case with a Tax Exempt Pension Fund, it is important in a case like this, a three-party case where the owner leaser is not a financing corporation that the transaction be given effect for tax purposes on the basis established by the agreement of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.614" offset="7266378">This is the conclusion which this Court reached in the Lazarus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.595" offset="7286336">There is no valid reason in tax policy for not applying that conclusion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.747" offset="7310891">The judgment below should be reversed and the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.931" offset="8355684">Oh, no well yes and no in the sense that I think one of the basic considerations in our conclusion, in Court of Appeals’ conclusion that Worthen Bank made the capital investment is that under the primary term of the lease that is the 25 year term, when Worthen was making these payments which although contractually it obligated itself that was paid by New York Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.038" offset="8496119">It paid via Frank Lyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.173" offset="8508657">It made the capital investment because it obligated itself, it locked itself into the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.078" offset="8528197">In other words New York Life insisted that Worthen’s obligation to make the payments be absolute without any deduction to set off or counter claim and Frank Lyon assigned the lease to New York Life and assigned its right to modify or terminate the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.159" offset="8624537">Worthen, in fact, in turn agreed to that assignment and agreed that it would not cancel the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.531" offset="8654107">So you have a situation and I think that fact is significant that Worthen by making these payments and being legally obligated, the documents themselves make it legally obligated to make these payments which pay off the mortgage that in effect it has made the capital investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.421" offset="8721608">I think the answer to your question, the option price is established a second and basic point which the courts have emphasized in this area and that is the option prices demonstrate that there was no way that Frank Lyon Co. could get anymore than $500,000 compounded at 6% in this deal, because if Worthen exercised the option at any point down the line that is the 11th, 15th, 25th year, those option prices in the record is undisputed on this point were calculated precisely to give Frank Lyon $500,000 back compounded at 6% interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2235.509" offset="9022016">Well, I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist that there are two operative principles in this area established by this Court which make this question freely reviewable on appeal and let me just briefly mention the Lazarus case itself stated that in the field of taxation, administrators of the laws and the courts are concerned with substance and realities and formal written documents are not rigidly binding that we take that to mean and the courts have taken to mean that if Frank Lyon calls itself an owner in these documents and Worthen Bank calls itself a lessee that those labels, that nomenclature is not controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.015" offset="9192021">Indeed, I suppose it, 'a' were to enter in to a document with 'b' and called it a lease and say, I am going to lease you these premises for $100,000 for one payment in perpetuity that that would be rent by the terms of the document but it would be clearly be a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.436" offset="9253670">Now, the second point and this is a point which I think needs addressing because Mr. Griswold mentioned the party’s expectations that more than 17 years ago in the Duberstein case the Court said with some compelling force, I think that it scarcely needs adding that the party’s expectations or hopes as to the tax treatment of their conduct in themselves have nothing to do with the matter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="3716.991" offset="14947946">Very briefly Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.745" offset="14958917">First I would like to correct one thing in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.091" offset="14976262">The question as to what Worthen Bank has been doing with this depreciation does appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.910" offset="15007609">It is at the bottom of page 201 and the top of page 202 where about two inches below the top of page 202, counsel for the Government says, I believe the bank has continued to treat the transaction as it was treated originally and though that is perhaps a little inconclusive, it was tied up by trial counsel Mr. Williamson, on page 216 of the record where he asked the present of Worthen Bank, has Worthen Bank contested that determination or agreed to it and President Pennick(ph) said we have contested it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.976" offset="15187854">Worthen Bank is not accepting the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.538" offset="15210110">Now, with respect to depreciation, I think that Mr. Smith has been a little glib in talking about 45 years, a building has lots of components including plumbing and mechanical and electrical and elevators and the depreciation period for them is 15 years for architectural and general construction it is 33 years, and finally for the structural frame it is 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.724" offset="15334871">The fact is that a very high proportion of this total depreciation is available within 25 years more than close to 90% and there is not much difference over the 25 years between double declining balance and straight line depreciation and then finally I would like to say that it is perfectly plain here Mr. Smith keeps saying in his brief here that permission was sough and it was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.019" offset="15452004">Well, it was given for the sale-leaseback arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.890" offset="15467469">Permission was sought to build the building and own it and it was refused and it is not a purely cosmetic matter of the banking officials trying to keep this from appearing on balance sheet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.910" offset="15527550">If Lyon’s liability is as lessee and that is the way in which Worthen supported Lyon’s liability, the same way that any building owner looks to his tenants to pay the rent in order that he can pay the bank but he has to have -- if Worthen went insolvent, I am not instantly familiar with the immediate details of the bankruptcy law but my recollection is that there would be a claim on behalf of the depositors for two years rent but not for all the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.832" offset="15695257">On the other hand, if Worthen Bank was liable on the note, there would be a claim in its bankruptcy for the entire amount of the note and that is a very real difference and the reason why the banking officials rightly would not allow Worthen to own the bank.</text>
