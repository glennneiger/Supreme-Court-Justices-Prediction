            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="10.384" offset="121462">This case is here on appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.373" offset="145391">At issue is a Wisconsin statute which requires persons, subject to child support decrees, to obtain court permission before they get married.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.879" offset="187396">Permission to marry can not be granted unless the applicant first submits proof of compliance with the support obligation and second demonstrates that the children will not become public charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.836" offset="239222">Appellee, Redhail, was unable to satisfy either of these conditions with respect to an illegitimate child he had fathered when he was still in the high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.006" offset="279973">After being denied a marriage license, he brought this class action charging the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.997" offset="307872">The District Court held that the law had violated the Equal protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment and enjoined its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.494" offset="337861">An opinion filed with the clerk, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.490" offset="357923">We hold that the right to marry is of fundamental importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.979" offset="375895">Since the classification created by the statute significantly interferes with the exercise of that right, we believe the Equal Protection Clause requires critical examination of the state interest,  master the support of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.191" offset="432738">None of the Stateâ€™s interest that have been suggested can withstand close scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.680" offset="454680">The state has numerous other names for enforcing support obligations and in many cases, such as appellee's, the statute simply prevents people from getting married, without benefiting the children in need of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.821" offset="511209">We therefore conclude that the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.390" offset="529495">The Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion; Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Stevens have filed opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.889" offset="571500">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
