            <text syncTime="51.038" offset="284052">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.479" offset="285828">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.711" offset="298785">We are here in this matter on petition for writ of certiorari in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal, granted by this Court on April 18, 1977, pursuant to 28 United States Code and Section 1254.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.398" offset="349567">The case involves ultimately the question of whether the state is barred from retrying George Washington Junior by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.512" offset="381959">It involves more precisely a factual situation, involving the granting of a mistrial by State Trial Judge without the defendants consent because of improper remarks made by the defense counsel in his opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.805" offset="439114">The issue being, whether the state is properly barred from retrying the defendant in federal Habeas proceedings solely because of the Trial Judge's failure to make specific findings based on the standard set out enjoin regarding his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.862" offset="495330">The facts are lengthy and have been in dispute throughout this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.512" offset="521975">Essentially George Washington Junior is presently in a custody of Sheriff Boykin, Sheriff of Pima County, Arizona accused of the murder of one James Hamphill.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.056" offset="552172">He was originally tried and convicted of this offense in May of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.108" offset="572339">He was granted a new trial in June of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.816" offset="587176">The basis for granting of the new trial was the state's failure to comply with this court's ruling in the Brady case.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.209" offset="612776">Ultimately a denial of due process was found and the new trial was granted on the grounds of newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.202" offset="636705">The state appealed that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.090" offset="644332">In that decision of the Arizona Supreme Court, the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the finding of the trial court in June of 1974 in a memorandum opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.385" offset="677456">The fact that it was a memorandum opinion becomes important later during the course of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.615" offset="698354">A new trial was held in Maryland in January of 1975, shortly following the defendant's notion for continuance on the grounds that you did not have all his witnesses ready and unable to go to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.680" offset="774631">Two different trial judge.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_d_neely" startTime="174.917" stopTime="374.730">
            <label>Mr. Stephen D. Neely</label>
            <text syncTime="174.917" offset="779647">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.626" offset="798455">Shortly after the commencement of the trial, there was questioning on voir dire of the jury engaged them by the prosecutor, in the case Mr. Butler, regrading credibility of witnesses wherein reference was made to the possible use of transcripts from, and I use his term, two prior proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.189" offset="876718">At the end of that time, the counsel for the defense moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the reference to prior proceedings was prejudiced over the defendant and that notion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.241" offset="916946">Shortly thereafter defense counsel commenced his voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.650" offset="930530">At that time informed the Panel that the defendant had in fact been previously tried for the offense, had in fact been convicted of the offense and had in fact spent some time in the prison, in the state of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.815" offset="991239">Sometime subsequent to that there was some indication by the trial court judge about his concern about the poisoning of the Panel in this matter, a request by the prosecutor to conduct individual voir dire which was conducted at short length to determine whether or not in fact any of the prospective jurors were aware of the reason behind the granting of the original in trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.071" offset="1064172">Subsequently, the opening argument or opening statement commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.975" offset="1079846">During the course of the opening statement given by the defense counsel, there were comments regarding misconduct by the prosecutor's comments regarding the prosecutor's willful withholding the evidence, the removal of the previous prosecutor from the case, apparently as a result of this and finally there was a comment to the effect that the jury was told that they would hear that because of these things the Arizona Supreme Court granted a new trial in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.822" offset="1195203">The lunch recess was held shortly thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.555" offset="1202203">There was a motion made by the prosecutor in the case for a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.073" offset="1216205">The grounds for that motion were that due to the improper statements of defense counsel, the jury had been prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.531" offset="1246089">The trial court listened to the argument, quite lengthy argument regarding the propriety of granting a mistrial at that point, based upon the comments made by defense counsel indicated some reluctance to rule at that time on the admissibility of the matter referred to regarding the Supreme Court, denied the notion and granted the prosecutor read through -- the opportunity to reopen the notion at a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.670" offset="1342638">The Court at that time expressed some concern about the case turning into one in which the county attorney's office was being put on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.312" offset="1377224">After that, two witnesses were called to testify and did in fact testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.953" offset="1395719">The following morning after further research on the matter, the prosecutor again moved for a mistrial citing two errors on the rules, one of which precludes reference to a past trial at a new trial, the other of which forbids the citation of memorandum opinions, as I mentioned earlier the opinion sustaining the finding of a need for a new trial by the Arizona Supreme Court was a memorandum opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.778" offset="1495088">There was again extensive argument during which the subject of manifest necessity was raised, during which both counsels argued on a possible question of tainting the jury panel by the statements made by defense counsel and as well defense counsel suggested the possibility of curative admonition and the state argued against it by virtue of what it deemed to be the prejudice to the Jury as a result of defense counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.950" offset="1639702">But the statement you just made was, that's what I am addressing my question to, the rule referred to a rule which was at that time still in effect?</text>

            <text syncTime="399.325" offset="1677214">Yes, Your Honor and that rule regrading the memorandum opinion is still in effect that they are not considered citation for the purposes of authority, other than within very limited circumstances they have been referred by the Ninth Circuit Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.135" offset="1740430">Ultimately, after the extensive argument was concluded for the second time, the court indicated that it was ready to rule and essentially rule that the mistrial was going to be granted based upon defendants remarks concerning Arizona Supreme Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.760" offset="1810961">Subsequently, there was special action filed by Washington's counsel, challenging the ruling of the court, that special action was filed with the Arizona Supreme Court who declined jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.260" offset="1861012">Our special action ruling incorporates all three of the extraordinary writs and presumably this is in the nature of either cert or prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.904" offset="1899568">The following step was to file a motion to quash the information in the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.169" offset="1924646">This was heard by Judge Birdsaw and denied and sometime during this period counsel had also filed a petition for habeas corpus with the federal court and had been told that a state remedy is yet being exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.139" offset="1968532">The ultimate step in state court was the filing of a Habeas petition to the Arizona Supreme Court again challenging our right to put Mr. Washington on trial again.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.031" offset="2008029">That petition was denied and finally the matter was undertaken by the federal district court. During the course of the proceedings before the federal district court, Judge Walsh raised on his own motion, the question of whether or not the findings of the trial court reflected a manifest necessary or reflected that the trial court had specifically found that there was Jury prejudice involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.994" offset="2111892">The court indicated that there had been a rather extensive review of the record by himself prior to asking this question and indicated in effect that his main question that remained was whether the findings indicating at the same time that if the findings were there to the effect that the court had found a manifest necessity before granting mistrial or had found jury prejudice that that would settle it and I use his terms for him.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="531.071" offset="2204261">When you say that Court you view as it has interchanged, you used Joe for judge Walsh and the other time you are referring to the Superior Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="538.651" offset="2234563">This is we are now in the district court in the federal Habeas petition and Judge Walsh is the one who indicated that he had reviewed the record and essentially raised the issue of whether or not there had been specific findings with regard to either manifest necessity being existent or with regard to jury prejudice being existent, indicated that he felt under ordinary circumstances after his review of the record that if a trial judge had thought so that he should have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.973" offset="2343859">And essentially at that point said in his own words that would settle it for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.064" offset="2360159">One he had a rule that Habeas should follow, the case was then taken to the Ninth Circuit Court and the Ninth Circuit Court again based it's ruling in affirming the district court on the fact that there had been no specific findings by the trial court with respect to the question of manifest necessity, with respect to the question of alternatives available to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="666.201" offset="2744786">It is our position at this point that there are number of issues that are before this Court, but that the first issue that must be addressed by the Court is the question of whether or not it was proper for either the district court or The Ninth Circuit to conclude that in the absence of specific findings by the trial court, that they were, therefore, prohibited from upholding the state's position and denying the petition for a writ of Habeas Corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.366" offset="2881354">Our position here today is that, this goes one step beyond previous requirements of this Court in the sense that this Court has specifically maintained in the past that the question of whether or not a mistrial is properly granted, is a question of whether or not the trial court has abused this discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.188" offset="2964633">The Court has consistently maintained from the days of present onward that it requires a consideration of all the circumstances which in our judgment would certainly make the finding of facts dealing with all the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.411" offset="3017609">Some are on us with the trial court, but in any there has never to my knowledge been holding that specifically says, that the position of the Court cannot be upheld and jeopardy must by necessity attach precluding retrial merely because the trial judge failed to make specific finding of fact on these issues presented of manifest necessity and the question of alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.133" offset="3116456">When the records clearly supports the fact, there was extensive argument in the case, that the trial court expressed on more than one occasion in this instance, his concern over the possibility of poisoning the panel, his concern over the possibility of the county attorneys office being put on trial and clearly his concern over the impropriety of comments made by the defense counsel to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.734" offset="3202870">The arguments of the counsel were likely at one point the trial court deny the motion for a mistrial, giving leave to reopen it, which indicates certainly that he was not taking his responsibility lightly and finally upon ultimate argument granted the motion for a mistrial because of the impropriety remarks and presumably the circumstances surrounding.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.279" offset="3309031">I think that the essence of the opinion of the court immediately below, is such that it requires the trial court essentially to make lists, if you were of findings, which taken at face value would relieve the a appellate courts of the opportunity of going into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.107" offset="3380398">It has never been my understanding nor do I read that in the cases that had been decided by this Court, that when the question of an abusive discretion, particularly involving double jeopardy is involved, that the appellate court is precluded merely by conclusary findings of fact by the trial court from delving into the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.664" offset="4018621">The question I think that first I would ask this Court to resolve is the question of whether or not the findings themselves are necessarily controlling on the determination that is made by the federal courts in revealing that the question of whether habeas corpus should be granted in situations, where a mistrial has been granted without the defendant's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.939" offset="4099705">I think the second question would be that even if the court finds that that is not the case there is still this remaining question and that is where the standard that was applied by The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in this matter on review the district court judgment was the correct standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.049" offset="4164176">I think the standard that is implied at least by the court's past decisions with respective to cases and situations wherein the mistrial is based upon a finding of misconduct or improper conduct on the part of the defense attorney is somewhat different than the standard that here was applied by the court in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.083" offset="4244215">The standard clearly there was the joint standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.938" offset="4255709">I think the standard should been have been some those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.339" offset="4265322">I think that if we are lining up the question of manifest necessity and the question of whether the ends of justice will be defeated by the continuing of the proceeding, that one of the things that should be considered in terms of the end of justice and that is the fact that the state also has a right to present its material, its case to an impartial and fairer jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.689" offset="4358736">I think a situation, for example in this case, the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona was improperly called as an unsworn witness, essentially to bolster the position of defense counsel and the defense that they clearly are several implications on a jury that can best be perceived by the trial court that could very well result and in fact probably would result in the trial court's attitude being prejudiced against the state and against giving the state a fair hearing on its trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.960" offset="4475764">I think the additional reference is to a long time that Mr. Washington has spent in prison, the reference is to the prosecutor been removed from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.186" offset="4512649">I think all of those references taken in conjunction with the again attempt to call upon the Supreme Court as unsworn witnesses to bolster the defense position could very well had been found by the trial judge under the circumstances to have compelled the granting of a mistrial in this case and could almost not have been found to meet the standard of the question whether the ends of justice necessitated in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.968" offset="4635843">I think it is clear that the possibility of the prejudices was so strong here that it clearly justified the finding of trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2295.328" offset="9261292">The Ninth Circuit says maybe or it is as possible for the trial judge to have ruled that the remark was error, therefore, we have to have a mistrial, as it was for the trial judge to have looked at the record, considered everything, just determined that there was a manifest necessity for a mistrial for a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2331.849" offset="9407369">The Court of Appeals in this case, the Ninth Circuit used a totality of circumstances test in which one of the factors considered was whether a finding of manifest necessity was made or whether there was a consideration to the alternatives to the mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.254" offset="9484901">The court expressly said it did not require the recitation of these talismanic words manifest necessity, but said that of review that they – that their record reflected that the trial court did not make any such finding and did not consider any alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.343" offset="9573299">The court did not express that any impropriety by the defense counsel was of the magnitude that it would prevent the jury from the arriving at fair and impartial verdict and in the concurring opinion sir, it was stated that there was no explicit or implicit finding of manifest necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.259" offset="9644979">It was stated that a greater part of their argument was devoted to whether the defense counsel's remarks were improper and whether the Supreme Court's decision could be brought to the jury's attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.746" offset="11234896">Just a moment Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.532" offset="11242105">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.942" offset="11251719">One thing I do want to make clear particularly reflected by a question by Mr Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.210" offset="11276796">I did not take the position that Judge Walsh would necessarily have stated or found that the record supported the finding of the mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.154" offset="11312532">The position I take was that Judge Walsh indicated that he had read and reread the record and that had there been a specific finding that would have basically settled It for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.707" offset="11354745">The implication that I read from that is that we do not really know whether or not he agreed with the trial Judge's finding, but that the basis for his granting the writ of habeas corpus was purely and simply that the trial judge did not say I find a manifest necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.264" offset="11420992">I think that is clear from the arguments of the counsel and the answers to the question that this case is one that turns on the facts, but again I would suggest that the position taken by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in this matter is essentially that in ordinary circumstances questions are raised, arguments are heard and findings are made and that the only thing that is missing in this case is the findings and I think that their position clearly is, that if those findings had been there, it would have been a different story because they talk about reluctantly dismissing and I think it is also clear that the basic approach they used here was to say we decline to imply from the impropriety committed by defense counsel that this court made a specific finding of manifest necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.233" offset="11604894">I do not believe that that is a fair standard to apply against trial judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.574" offset="11618269">I believe that there has to be, when you have set out your standard as being an abuse of discretion on the part of trial judge that there has to be an addition to the scrupulous exercise of discretion by the trial judge, a scrupulous exercise of the Appellate Court's review of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.917" offset="11691621">In essence, I think that the Appellate Court has to go back to the record and has to determine whether or not the trial Judge's position was or was not abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.549" offset="11718161">Surely, if I came up here as a defendant and said that there was an abuse of discretion you would not hear me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.555" offset="11750135">On the other hand to say as a prosecutor, well, there may have been, but there is findings here that specifically state that there was manifest necessity and all the alternatives were considered and that is final on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.214" offset="11788796">Thank you very much.</text>
