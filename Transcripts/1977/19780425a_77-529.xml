            <text syncTime="905.922" offset="3703575">The district judge says, This Court is accepting the city plan of eight/three.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.276" offset="3721024">I am ordering that the election schedule for April of this year will proceed and elect the City Council for this year under the city plan of eight/three that has been presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.753" offset="3754984">At the same time, this Court will, I am going to enter a final order, I mean an adjustment in the opinion that is going to take me several days, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.763" offset="3786957">So he indicated at that time that it seems to us that this was a tentative or preliminary decision on the matter and that he intended shortly thereafter to render his official decision on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.051" offset="3908166">Now, Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court, it is our position that at the time that the Court first entered a written order in its first binding order that the City Council had already promulgated as law this eight/three plan which is in contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.976" offset="4003774">By the time the filing date arrived for the ensuing election, the plan had been promulgated as law, and by the time the judgment was finally entered in case, of course, the plan had been promulgated as law by the City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.288" offset="4077021">We contend that because the council had promulgated as law this election plan with full authority under state law that this is not a court order plan and that the special circumstances rule of the East Carroll case should not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.327" offset="4145253">We suggest instead that the rule of Burns v. Richardson applies and that the plan should be subject only to constitutional review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.373" offset="4193423">Alternatively, we submit to the Court, that even if the East Carroll rule is applicable, that the Court of Appeals has erred in saying that the special circumstances present in the case which deal with the voting situation of Mexican-American voters can be considered only if there is a constitutional violation and we think that this is contrary to indications that we see in the opinion in the United U.S. Organizations v. Carrie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.512" offset="4326020">We do not think that special circumstances in a case like this depend on a prior showing of a constitutional violation and we think that in this case as in any equitable case or decree in equity that the Court should take into consideration the general public interest and should not enter a decree which will harm any segment of the population and we think that the findings of the District Court show that if and all single member district plan were put into effect that the Mexican-American voters would very definitely harmed by that decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.714" offset="4482755">The other issue in the case which supports the use of a mixed at-large and single member system is the finding of the District Court that it would be beneficial to the city to have general citywide interest represented on the council so as to provide factionalism among wards within the city and so that the City Council members would be exposed to a more statesmanlike view and that projects of interest to the city in general would not suffer from having been subjected to ward interest and the factionalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.386" offset="4657462">May it please the Court, we will reserve the rest of our time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.353" offset="4737292">It is the contention of respondents here today that this Court is dealing with the fact situation that is clearly within the ambit of Connor v. Johnson and East Carroll Parish v. Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.832" offset="4803225">We believe that the threshold issue is the standard of review that is to be applied by an appeals court and that that standard of review is determined by whether or not we are dealing with a court ordered plan or a legislated plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.194" offset="4880652">It is our contention that we have here is very clearly a court ordered plan, that is a plan that was ordered into existence by Federal Court exercising its equitable jurisdiction in an adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.490" offset="4953900">Now, there is some ambiguity in the record as it is presented in the appendix and I would like to address myself to that at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.142" offset="5020460">I would point out on page 147 of the appendix, that the Court itself stated that at the close of testimony on February 8th, 1975, I made findings which approved the city?s plan as constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.680" offset="5090677">Accordingly, I order that the eight/three plan as had been offered by the city be instituted in time for the April 1975 City Council election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.169" offset="5140623">Let me point out that at this point that the City Council does not either by resolution or by ordinance have the power to change the election system in the city of Dallas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2714.834" offset="10939284">But more importantly it's contention of the respondents that in order for there to be an unusual circumstance to support the Mexican-American issue raised by the district court there would have to be facts in the record to support a finding that single member districts would restrict the access of Mexican-American voters and there are no such findings in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.832" offset="11039281">In fact, the district court could only conclude that Mexican-American voters might suffer restriction and access under the single member district plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.788" offset="11215033">In fact, we presented to the court a witness, a Mexican-American by the name of Robert Madrano, who had run at-large for a school board seat and lost and then when they changed to an all single member district plan had won in a seat that was approximately evenly divided between Blacks, Mexican-American, and White voters, therefore demonstrating and the only factual demonstration in the record that Mexican-Americans could in fact win in single member district circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.736" offset="11762873">The court itself acknowledged in its opinion that at-large voting might operate in part as a restriction of the access of American voters and we think there is simply no evidence to support them as unusual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.511" offset="11813968">Finally, let me address briefly the issue of whether or not a city wide viewpoint can also be an unusual circumstance. I point to the Court's opinion in last time Connor v. Finch where this Court indicated that historic policy in multi member districts was not a sufficient reason to uphold multi member districts and in Wallace v. House itself the Court of Appeals originally attempted to justify a single at-large seat among five on grounds that they were avoiding ward parochialism, a contention subsequently rejected on remand.</text>

Marshall, however, did find that the district court in ordering at-large elections, not only the East Carroll Parish School Board, but also for the parish jury which is the local legislative body had violated the remedial principles that this court has set out in numerous reapportionment cases, all of them beginning with one man, one vote violations.</text>

Chaviz where the Court found that there was no restriction of access by Blacks to the political process, but the Blacks were primarily democrats, there were lots of republicans in Indiana and the republicans won a lot of elections and as the consequence of that there were very few Blacks that were elected to the state legislature from Marion County, Indiana, but that is not what the district court found in this case and I think the evidence supports the findings of the district court.</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Johnston, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="4048.991" offset="16275891">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.303" offset="16281116">In response to the question by Mr. Justice Powell, I believe you asked does it make a difference that we have had at-large voting since 1907, I believe you asked that question of Mr. Johnston. Looking at Mr. Justice Blackmun?s opinion in the Chapman case, I get the feeling that this theory is based on a deference to state action and that what is really critical here is whether the federal courts are imposing some system of elections on a state which is contrary to established state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.085" offset="16440254">Now, if that is what we are really dealing with here, I think it is clear that the use of at-large voting in Dallas city elections is a clearly established state policy both in the State of Texas and the City of Dallas and that there is no affront to the sovereignty of the State of Texas by virtue of this federal court order which either orders or approves the use of at-large voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.660" offset="16546520">We had places, what we are dealing with here, places 9, 10 and 11 on our City Council, those places 9, 10, and 11 were at-large places beginning with the Charter of 1968 was when we went from 9 to 11 members, so places 9, 10, and 11 remain absolutely unchanged since 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.702" offset="16650696">Furthermore, as a direct response to your question, Mr. Justice Powell, we have had at-large voting generally since 1907 and that of course was instituted in the City of Dallas before we had Home Rule and it was done by the Act of the Texas Legislature in 1907, so we have had it continuously in various forms since 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.578" offset="16734184">We have had it in our charter with respect to these exact three positions on the council since 1968 and I think there is absolutely no question that this at-large voting, and of course, it is the at-large voting that we are arguing about here today that is in contention, and clearly the federal court did not impose at-large voting contrary to established state policy, so I see no reason to invoke the East Carroll rule in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.392" offset="16853511">Now, Mr. Justice Brennan, with respect to the submission of the Charter Amendment under Section 5, I think, very clearly, the literal language of the statute requires pre-clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.041" offset="16904084">Now, the only problem that we see with this is that as we all recognize, whether this is a court ordered plan or whether it is a court approved plan, a federal district judge has indicated his approval of the plan and so, if we come to the point where we submit the plan to the district court of the District of Columbia, I think we are submitting, in effect, the approval of the local district judge to the further approval of the district court of the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="4364.788" offset="17539069">One was the question that the Court just settled in Sheffield and the other was that we were not sure about this question of whether it was the fact that the district court would indicate some approval about it, but to try to clarify my point about the effect of what the local district judge has done here, I do not think that just the fact that the local district judge has approved the plan on some points and possibly not on the substantive issues required by the Voting Rights Act, necessarily means that we do not have to submit it.</text>
