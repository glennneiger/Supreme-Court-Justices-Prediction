            <text syncTime="37.810" offset="231193">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.786" offset="251046">This case arises out of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.997" offset="279885">This particular action began or had its genesis in the charge that was filed with the EEOC in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.789" offset="319069">This charge was processed and disposed of by a 'right to sue' letter issued by that agency in July 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.248" offset="360969">In January 1974, the Commission filed a suit in the District Court for the Western District of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.231" offset="400884">On that charge on the basis of purported authority contained in the 1972 amendments to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.519" offset="446024">The EEOC Commission lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.710" offset="466817">Some time after that the prevailing defendant pursuant to Section 706 (k) of Title VII, which states, "The Court in its discretion may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney’s fee, filed a motion in the District Court for attorney’s fees in the case."</text>
            <text syncTime="122.043" offset="568068">The District Court held that the prevailing defendant was not entitled to attorney’s fees because the EEOC had exercised good faith in bringing and maintaining the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.772" offset="639016">Christiansburg appealed to the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.365" offset="661377">At this time the Fourth Circuit had followed the decision of this Court in Newman versus Piggie Park Enterprises to the effect that prevailing plaintiffs should be awarded attorney’s fees in the ordinary cases unless there are some special compelling circumstances that they should not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.490" offset="773913">Despite this rule, it was followed in the Fourth Circuit in the case of prevailing plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.244" offset="800871">The Fourth Circuit in a two to one decision, ruled in favor of the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.159" offset="836607">So we are now before this Court with the issue before the Court fairly simple in the sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.248" offset="872969">The issue being whether prevailing defendants and plaintiffs are to be treated equally in the awarding of attorney’s fees under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.764" offset="939007">As of this time, some of the Circuit Courts follow a double standard in which they award attorney’s fees to defendants only in bad faith cases while other Circuit Courts most recently panels of the Sixth and the Fifth Circuit are ruled that defendants are entitled to attorney’s fees on the same basis as the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.576" offset="1050288">We of course argue that equality of treatment should prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.350" offset="1081322">In our brief, we have argued that the plain meaning of Section 706 should control that the statute says simply the Court may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney’s fees.</text>

            <label>Mr. William W. Sturges</label>
            <text syncTime="307.872" offset="1311408">Indeed as we point out in this brief here, if the rule is not to be the same for prevailing defendants and prevailing plaintiffs, what is it to be?</text>
            <text syncTime="323.356" offset="1373371">We suggest it is not to be the bad faith rule for the prevailing defendant and the ordinary rule for the prevailing plaintiff which is the Court of Appeals’ rule, if it is not to be that then a new rule from whole clause, if you will, has to be construed whatever that may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.524" offset="1470024">Frankly in the Circuit Court we suggest that some rule or reason, but that was very difficult, if you will, to apply, and secondly there was really no statutory basis for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.317" offset="1529165">If I may add this by the time we arrived in the Court of Appeals in the Fourth Circuit, the tied was running pretty latch against the position that we now has supposed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.008" offset="1579947">In terms of the plain meaning of the statute, respondent and the amici who support respondent do not seem to take much issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.107" offset="1628326">They suggest rather that the legislative history or perhaps policy considerations overwrite what the plain meaning of the statute suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.637" offset="1678481">In respect to the legislative history, there is no question that the first bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives provided only that prevailing plaintiffs would be entitled to the Award of Attorney’s Fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.111" offset="1748385">Our concept was subsequently changed to prevailing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.089" offset="1780254">Two Senators commented in the debates and very similar language under Title II that if the plaintiffs lost attorney's fees could be awarded against them, indeed one of those senators replied to a statement by Senator Irvin of North Carolina that the Act might encourage ambulant chasing, and the reply was no it would not encourage ambulant chasing because the attorney’s fees could be awarded against the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.091" offset="1944303">Now it is arguable that the legislative history is inconclusive, but what is not inconclusive is there is no legislative history, suggesting that a different standard applied to defendants then applied to plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.362" offset="2013371">There is just nothing then the legislative history that deals without particular subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.147" offset="2040538">In view of that which concluded that the legislative history is inconclusive, then we suggest all them more reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.705" offset="2074811">The plain meaning of the statute should apply and the rule let so provides.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.910" offset="2107620">Mr. Sturges, you keep talking by the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.324" offset="2125279">The statute says that the Trial Court may exercise its discretion to assess attorney’s fees either against the plaintiff or against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.833" offset="2163314">It does not say that that it shall -- it did not say a word about it is applying the same criteria, may be on its discretionary the -- plain meaning of the language is that it need not and should not use the same criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.322" offset="2225276">It talks about the Trial Court’s discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.743" offset="2234889">But there was -- what is there in the plain meaning of the statute in other words that leads an elective way to conclusion that the criteria have to be identical?</text>

            <text syncTime="577.645" offset="2390474">Now, in passing the statute if the Congress had intended that different statutes or different standards would apply, it could, for example, have just said, only prevailing plaintiffs will be entitled to attorney’s fees, and then in that event, the only time the defendants would be entitled to attorney’s fees if they prevail would be if the plaintiff had acted in bad faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.947" offset="3059732">Your Honor, I think all I need to go is that whatever discretion is exercised and for either party, it should be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.577" offset="3154295">Arguments that have been made in the briefs for the amici, the respondent's amici, suggest that if this Court were to rule as the petitioner argues that plaintiffs would be chilled in bringing actions under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.965" offset="3263800">We suggest to this Court that, that has not happened up to this point and this statute has plaintiffs -- attorneys have been aware of the statute since 1964, and indeed there has been a plethora of litigation under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.317" offset="3353243">So we do not conceive if this Court rules that the statute means the same kind of discretion is to be exercised for both parties that this will chill any litigation that it has not chilled so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.331" offset="3441224">At most the legislative history suggests that the purpose in passing the statute was both to encourage litigation and discourage litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.028" offset="3508097">To encourage litigation that would be meritorious and to discourage litigation that would be unmeritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.897" offset="3547490">The statute suggests that the determinant is who prevails, whether it is the plaintiff or the defendant, and that prevailer is the one that is entitled to the attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.887" offset="3639441">I guess, I can best sum up, if you will, stating what the dissent said in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.535" offset="3706105">Then that result we end up with as a result of the majority opinion under statute which says the Court may allow an attorney’s fees in its discretion to the prevailing party, it is that a prevailing plaintiff is unallowed and attorney’s fees absent exceptional circumstances, while a prevailing defendant under the same statute is not allowed an attorney’s fee unless the plaintiff has prosecuted his action in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.347" offset="3829299">I suggest this is not the level floor the court house demands.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.123" offset="3900456">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.270" offset="3912995">The attorney’s fees provisions of Title II and VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act are by their terms permissive grants that the Court in its discretion may allow prevailing party a reasonable attorney’s fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.366" offset="3973390">In Newman versus Piggie Park Enterprises, this Court established standards to inform that discretion with respect to plaintiffs' awards under Title II, and before the Court today are similar standards for defendants also based upon the proposition that statutory discretion is not a license for arbitrary action, and the question here as it was a Newman, is whether the standards properly effectuate the congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.155" offset="4088538">Now, these standards which are now followed by six Courts of Appeals, state that the indicia associated with fee awards to defendants are vexatiousness, meritless litigation, abusive conduct, frivolous litigation, or an attempt to harass or embarrass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.898" offset="4159487">We think that the so called good faith test is what Congress intended because –</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.154" offset="4180594">1. It tracks the purpose statements in the legislative history of the 1964 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.805" offset="4203163">2. It was relied upon by Congress in enacting parallel civil rights legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.646" offset="4226569">3. It preserved the enforcement incentive provided by Section 706 (k).</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.595" offset="4366376">No one deposes the EEOC to decide what their motives were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.166" offset="4384558">They look to whether they had made sense whether there was a reasonable ground, whether there was in fact some evidence of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.740" offset="4414860">They look to the fact that the EEOC has a burden, a responsibility to advance Title VII’s purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.022" offset="4520081">The courts have a discretionary grant from Congress, and I look to these indices to see if something like this has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.276" offset="4545054">Now, if the EEOC brought litigation that was, let's say had a reasonable legal ground, or let's say private plaintiff, but litigation had a reasonable legal ground.</text>
