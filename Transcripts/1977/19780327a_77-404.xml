            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80133">We will hear arguments first this morning in City of Philadelphia against New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.012" offset="112107">Mr. Moore, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert F. Moore</label>
            <text syncTime="23.390" offset="173651">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.001" offset="192042">This case is back on a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.970" offset="199983">We were here about a year ago, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.568" offset="214402">The case concerns the constitutionality of a New Jersey statute that is known as Public Law 1973, Chapter 363.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.987" offset="268006">We are weighing this statute against the -- its validity under the commerce clause as well as under the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.130" offset="312623">I will try to divide my time as equally as possible so I can cover both of the very important subjects and would like to reserve five minutes also for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.078" offset="360375">The statute in New Jersey bans the disposal of solid waste that originated out of New Jersey in New Jersey, that is the first Section of the statute, the Second section is also a very small paragraph and that bans the transportation of solid waste from -- that originated out of New Jersey into and through New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.610" offset="482523">Now, the first question, of course, that we have to face with in considering the commerce clause situation is, is the subject matter and the activity legitimate in interstate commerce so that the commerce clause would even apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="118.846" offset="555457">Here, we are dealing with a subject matter that is very broad by definition of the New Jersey statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.698" offset="590879">It covers every type of conceivable waste, both solid and liquid.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.222" offset="612926">We should not fix in our minds rubbish or garbage as such as being the sole object of the statute because it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.303" offset="657335">This covers automobile hulks which this Court recognized in the Hughes v. Alexandria Motors case not so long ago as being a legitimate item in interstate commerce, it includes demolition material.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.277" offset="709162">It includes the scraps from industry and commerce and hotels and restaurants, as well, of course, residential scraps.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.616" offset="758585">Then, in addition to the subject matter which we contend is legitimate because there are very -- there are two industries that depend upon this subject matter for their economic survival.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.585" offset="806442">One is the collection industry or the transporters of this waste and the other is the disposers of the waste which are basically in New Jersey, the solid waste landfill, sanitary landfill operators.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="193.983" stopTime="219.542">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="193.983" offset="855970">But would the existence of these companies in that kind of business alone give them any special status?</text>
            <text syncTime="199.286" offset="877181">Suppose, for example, they instead of taking it over to New Jersey, they decided to haul it out to sea a little distance and drop it, would that be -- would there be a barrier to enforcing restraints against that for environmental purposes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_f_moore" startTime="219.542" stopTime="334.559">
            <label>Mr. Herbert F. Moore</label>
            <text syncTime="219.542" offset="958265">No, I do not believe so, Your Honor, because we are not arguing here that New Jersey does not have the right to deal evenhandedly in protecting its environment and the health that they definitely do.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.614" offset="1006540">The question is, are they dealing in an evenhanded non-discriminatory fashion in doing this?</text>
            <text syncTime="236.390" offset="1025661">The state has admitted that there is no qualitative difference between waste originating in another state and waste originating in New Jersey and as I develop my argument, I will point out how there is actually this is a facade, there is no environmental harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.218" offset="1088982">There is no degradation to the environment to a properly regulated and operated sanitary landfill and that has been recognized by the Congress as well in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.286" offset="1133181">And so I do not believe that it detracts in any way the fact that the item in commerce may be of value to only a very few people and anyway detracts from its legitimacy as an item of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.778" offset="1199219">Now, what is it that the disposers, the sanitary landfill operators, do?</text>
            <text syncTime="286.248" offset="1225028">What function do they perform?</text>
            <text syncTime="288.241" offset="1233073">They are selling something.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.843" offset="1239447">They are selling really a product in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.834" offset="1247389">They are selling space in a sanitary landfill for the permanent interment of solid waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.980" offset="1283960">It is very much similar to a warehouseman selling space on a short-term basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.925" offset="1311754">He is not particularly concerned with the intrinsic value of the item that he rents space for.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.326" offset="1341429">And likewise, the sanitary landfill operator, other than the requirements of environmental standards is not concerned with the intrinsic worth of the particular item going into his landfill, but he is performing a function of selling something and he is selling space.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.395" offset="1445710">We could imagine the situation, Justice Rehnquist, of New York City which has been running out of cemetery space as you all know, anybody who has driven through there is well-aware of that and New Jersey -- New York put a ban that dead bodies could not be moved in unless they died as residents of the State of New York, I think, I myself, I would recognize that as being rather ludicrous, but that is the exact type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.227" offset="1541005">The cemetery sells permanent and termite space and that is what the sanitary landfill does.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.705" offset="1802856">It is a very large industry in New Jersey and the environmental controls that the state exacts are extremely high and extremely expensive to install and that in its self supports a lot of peripheral industries that supply the environmental machines, mechanics, and things like that, a tremendous, heavily compacting units and bulldozers, etcetera, that go into operating of a sanitary landfill.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.089" offset="1928453">Now, the federal courts in United States v. Pennsylvania Refuse Haulers has recognized for the purposes of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, transportation or disposal -- transportation and disposal of waste to be a legitimate subject of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.481" offset="2005984">The Congress in the House Report on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, that is Report number 94, 1491, at several sections in their Committee Report, but I will just read one of them, it is on page 9, states “most of our discarded materials have, at some time, entered the flow of interstate commerce, if not as waste itself then in the form of products which will, at some future time, constitute waste.”</text>
            <text syncTime="517.193" offset="2148822">The fact that waste itself is an interstate and inter-municipal, Congress has raised a number of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.362" offset="2177557">Several jurisdictions including some states have attempted to prohibit the importation of waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.843" offset="2203470">So it has been recognized by Congress, it has been recognized by the federal courts and it is recognized by New Jersey that the transportation and disposal are legitimate businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.509" offset="2246102">They are engaged in intrastate commerce in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.868" offset="2255506">They are public utilities in New Jersey, the collectors and the disposers.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.542" offset="2286226">Now, under the commerce clause, of course, the test as to whether a state statute can legitimately co-exist in this field and regulate commerce, there has to meet certain tests and standards which this Court has developed over the years that are recited in Pike v. Bruce Church and many of the others, the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Co-Trail and all the way down and basically, it is that the state statute must deal in an evenhanded non-discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.343" offset="2445469">It must serve a legitimate local purpose and not be a burden on interstate commerce or at least it must not be an excessive burden, if it turns out to be somewhat of a burden then of course we go into the balancing of the national interest against the local interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.806" offset="2515268">The New Jersey statute discriminates, in that New Jersey says, and they have stated this, the acting governor when the bill was enacted made the statement, that we want to preserve this as a natural resource, meaning the sanitary landfills, for the benefit of the residents of the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.084" offset="2600427">They are, in effect hording a resource.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.438" offset="3021834">Well, you say that a state may not “horde” its natural resources and I am asking you if a zoning ordinance which as applied to someone who wants to build houses on quarter-acre lots insists that the minimum requirement is a five-acre lot, is guilty of hording?</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert F. Moore</label>
            <text syncTime="756.517" offset="3106157">No, I do not think that is guilty of hording at all because you have the due process clause coming in to protect that type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.878" offset="3127578">As long as the regulation is reasonable and deals with the subject matter in an evenhanded fashion and is not arbitrary or capricious, then it is not a hording type of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.275" offset="3197168">Also, this New Jersey statute in discrimination, it says to the operators of landfills in New Jersey, it says “you may sell your space in an unlimited way to anybody in New Jersey whose waste originated in New Jersey, but you cannot sell any space whatsoever to someone that is a business outside of the State of New Jersey whose waste originates outside of the State of New Jersey” and I think that is a very blatant example of the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.632" offset="3318585">Noe, the health and environment aspects, the findings of the New Jersey legislature at the beginning of the statute indicates that they are leaning on health and environment to justify this encouraging of the commerce clause by the State of New Jersey and just briefly, the state itself, Grant Walton, when he was Director of the Division of Environmental Quality of the Department of Environmental Protection of the State of New Jersey, in a published talk that he gave which is also in our brief on page 9, he stated that the health hazard, water and air pollution, methane gas problems commonly associated with landfills can be eliminated through proper design and operation of the facility, properly done, abandoned surface mines become parks, playgrounds, and golf courses.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.524" offset="3546164">This is the Head of that Department in New Jersey who, himself, recognized that New Jersey standards were sufficiently high that there was no threat to the environment, no threat to the health of the public in the operation of the sanitary landfill.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.280" offset="3597155">The New Jersey Supreme Court in its opinion in this case gave judicial notice to the New Jersey solid waste management plan and that plan states that a there is no technological reason why we cannot dispose of solid waste with a minimum of environmental harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.576" offset="3682419">Under the state’s control, absolutely under the state’s control.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.776" offset="3699137">And that went on to say that the regulations in New Jersey with which to regulate and ensure a nuisance-free operation in disposal site in conformance with good practices and health standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.556" offset="3766324">Interestingly, the Solid Waste Management Act, if I may just pause here for a moment, the Act that we are weighing here is called the Waste Control Act and that is just a prohibitory piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.264" offset="3825152">New Jersey also has another Act called the Solid Waste Management Act which is not before this Court, but that is the piece of legislation that is very broad and very pervasive and it has to do with the regulation of sanitary landfills and any type of waste disposal and transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.605" offset="3906549">When that statute was originally enacted around 1970, they used the word “crisis” and they said New Jersey was facing the crisis because of the manner in which landfills were being operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.460" offset="3957958">When they amended that statute here about a year ago, they left the word “crisis” out.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.280" offset="3981155">So apparently, the New Jersey legislature itself does not recognize today that there is a crisis as there was several years ago, at least they thought there was at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.783" offset="4019189">Now, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, again in the Committee Report, to start with, has recognized that disposal of solid waste at a sanitary landfill is not a threat to the environment or the health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.482" offset="4094004">It stated that the legislative standard, this is on page 37 of the Report, the legislative for the administrator to determine the sanitary landfill is a disposal site of which there is no reasonable chance of adverse effects on health and the environment from the disposal of the discarded materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.093" offset="4172476">This, in the definition, in 42 U.S.C. 6944 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Congress has stated in defining a sanitary landfill that there is no reasonable probability of adverse affect on health and environment from disposal of solitary waste at such a facility, meaning a sanitary landfill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.787" offset="4259202">Now, I notice in reading a case that was decided here last week, Ray v. Atlantic Richfield, an interesting comparison there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.387" offset="4297655">There, the Court said, in dealing with the oil tankers in Puget Sound “the supremacy clause dictates that the federal judge, that a vessel is safe to navigate US waters prevails over a contrary state judgment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.628" offset="4358572">Now, in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, there is a federal judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.326" offset="4373410">The federal judgment is that these landfills can be operated safely, no threat to the environment or the public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.096" offset="4400473">Now, it seems to me with that same line of reasoning then it must follow that there is no reasonable probability of adverse effect on the public health and this must prevail, this over a contrary state judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.167" offset="4464734">Now, the local interest that is being served, I believe we must discount health and environment because I think it even though we, let me just stop for a moment, we all recognize that there are problems associated with the improper handling and treatment and disposal of solid waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.343" offset="4561491">There is no question about that and we have gone into that great detail in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.368" offset="4585524">These problems are absolutely controllable as has been recognized by the Congress of the United States, it has been recognized by the Department of Environmental Protection actually of the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.253" offset="4629096">So the local benefit really is an economic benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.088" offset="4648427">This has been stated by when acting Governor Beatleson signed this first statute into law, Governor Keyheal was a white, he made a public statement that this is going to preserve for New Jersey residence, these landfill areas for their use because there is tremendous costs involved in hauling waste for long-distances and that really is what it boils down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.367" offset="4733586">New Jersey wants to gain the advantage of having these sanitary landfills kept in New Jersey only for their use so that industry and private people will not be subjected to the expenses of hauling longer distances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.378" offset="7409570">This case involves the disposal of waste onto the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.481" offset="7430050">Waste is not a product which New Jersey has chosen or elected to manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.395" offset="7457635">Rather, it is what the name implies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.973" offset="7467980">It is the useless byproducts of human existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.555" offset="7482295">If we could eliminate the generation of all waste, we would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.318" offset="7509357">However, we cannot do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.781" offset="7515209">Human beings in their day-to-day existence create waste and so long as waste continues to be created, we must find a way to dispose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.740" offset="7567036">The only generally feasible means of disposing of common household waste and commercial waste in the present time is by dumping the waste onto the land.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen Skillman</label>
            <text syncTime="1888.768" offset="7635163">You can incinerate, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.438" offset="7645821">It is not done that much at the present time and one of the reasons is that it is very difficult to do that without creating a different kind of environmental problem, i.e. air pollution from the environmental problems that are created with landfills which I will get into in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.116" offset="7712590">You also can dump into the ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.519" offset="7718128">Again, another whole set of environmental problems, so the prevailing mode of disposal of household and commercial waste in this country today is landfilling and not the exclusive one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.874" offset="7767552">There are some incineration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.701" offset="7774866">I think there is still a limited amount of dumping into the ocean, but each one of those creates environmental problems and health risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.311" offset="7817289">I would like to briefly go through what those environmental and health risks are with respect to landfilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.470" offset="7849994">One of the primary effects of landfilling is the creation of a leachate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.258" offset="7881132">As all of the various products go into the landfill, water also comes in either by rain or by tidal flow or in one other way and when the landfill becomes saturated, it starts to produce this highly polluted liquid called “leachate” which can run off into both ground water and in the surface waters and ultimately can pollute the water which we use for drinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.595" offset="7994504">So It is a very substantial environmental danger from the leachate produced by landfills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.673" offset="8018745">A second environmental danger from landfills is the creation of methane gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.679" offset="8050824">It is quite common in landfills and even those where they are using modern techniques of landfilling for gases to get produced in sufficient concentrations under the ground for fires to breakout as a result of a concentration of methane gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.451" offset="14081870">It has to be within some reasonable hauling distance whether it is 60 miles, 70, or 100 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.717" offset="14106948">It cannot be 250 miles away when it is that kind of waste.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.770" offset="14163163">I think the case that comes closest to this case in terms of the commerce clause issues is the case of Clayson v. the State of Indiana which the Court decided in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.100" offset="14204437">The Court in that case upheld an Indiana statute which in practical effect, prohibited the interstate transportation of animal carcasses not slaughtered for food.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.040" offset="14252293">Now, we would submit that there is no significant difference in commerce clause terms between the disposal of dead animals and the disposal of waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.753" offset="14295134">The Clayson case, therefore, provides very direct and very strong support for the position of the State of New Jersey that its prohibition upon the disposal within New Jersey of waste originating out of state is consistent with the commerce clause.</text>
