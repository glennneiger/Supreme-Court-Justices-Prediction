            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="10.532" offset="122357">This case is here because the grant of petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the respondent, Paul Lewis Hayes was indicted by a grand jury in Kentucky on a charge of uttering a forged instrument, offense then punishable by a term of 2 to 10 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.832" offset="223504">After arraignment, Hayes, his retained counsel, and the Commonwealth's Attorney met in the presence of the Clerk of the Court to discuss a possible plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.222" offset="265090">During these conferences the prosecutor offered to recommend a sentence of five years in prison if Hayes would plead guilty to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.673" offset="298841">He also said that if Hayes did not plead guilty and in his words, "save the court the inconvenience and necessity of a trial," he would return to the grand jury to seek an indictment under the Kentucky Habitual Criminal Act, which would subject Hayes to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment by reason of his two prior felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.700" offset="387030">Hayes chose not to plead guilty, and the prosecutor did obtain an indictment charging him under the Habitual Criminal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.563" offset="422452">A jury found Hayes guilty on the principal charge of uttering a forged instrument and, in a separate proceeding, further found that he had twice before been convicted of felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.804" offset="471458">As required by the habitual offender statute, he was sentenced to a life term in the penitentiary and these convictions were affirmed on appeal by the - in the Kentucky courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.419" offset="525897">On Hayes' petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky agreed that there had been no constitutional violation in the sentence or the indictment procedure, and denied the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.912" offset="583889">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.447" offset="601966">We granted certiorari to consider a constitutional question of importance in the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.429" offset="645956">For the reasons set out in the opinion of the court filed today, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.830" offset="675526">There is no doubt that the breadth of discretion that our country's legal system vests in prosecuting attorneys carries with it the potential for both individual and institutional abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.008" offset="724219">And broad though that discretion may be, there are undoubtedly constitutional limits upon its exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.517" offset="754312">But we hold that the course of conduct engaged in by the prosecutor in this case, which no more than openly presented the defendant with the unpleasant alternatives of forgoing trial or facing charges on which he was plainly subject to prosecution, did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.532" offset="834351">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.891" offset="847726">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined and Mr. Justice Powell has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
