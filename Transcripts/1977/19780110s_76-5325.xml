            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.678" offset="114703">The petitioner in this case was convicted in a Illinois court of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.340" offset="137272">After exhausting state remedies he sought Habeas Corpus relief in the Federal District Court in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.227" offset="168828">That Court held that petitioner had been arrested without probable cause and ordered his relief unless he should retried.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.924" offset="207699">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed this judgment on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.523" offset="230059">Petitioner however had contended that the State had failed to appeal within the time prescribed on the Federal rules of civil and appellate procedure and that therefore the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.615" offset="294425">And we agree with the petitioner on this jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.051" offset="312188">We do not reach the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.519" offset="322010">The question of some interest of lawyers and judges that prompted us to review this case, consents the applicability of certain of the rules of civil procedure to Habeas Corpus proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.759" offset="378957">For reasons stated in our opinion filed with the clerk today.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.898" offset="395571">We hold that these rules do apply and the state's appeal not having been filed within the 30 days of the original order by the District Court was not timely under the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.218" offset="452832">Accordingly we conclude that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review the District Courts order.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.839" offset="479268">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.777" offset="495045">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
