            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79983">The second case in which I am authorized to announce the opinion and judgment this morning is in number 77-5353 Rufus Jr. Mincey, petitioner against the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.243" offset="152917">A case that is here on Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.379" offset="177472">The petitioner was convicted in an Arizona Trial Court on charges of murder, assault, and three counts of narcotics offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.391" offset="221462">At his trial and on appeal, he contended that evidence used against him had been unlawfully seized from his apartment without a warrant and that statements used to impeach his credibility were inadmissible because they had not been made voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.092" offset="292306">The Arizona Supreme Court reversed the murder and assault convictions on state-law grounds, but affirmed the narcotics convictions rejecting both of the federal constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.074" offset="348208">It held that the warrantless search of a homicide scene is permissible under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and that Mincey's statements were voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.282" offset="389064">We granted certiorari to consider these substantial constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.843" offset="419261">As to the first issue, we hold for the reasons discussed in some detail in the written opinion of the court that the so called murder scene exception created by the Arizona Supreme Court is inconsistent with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments that the warrantless search of Mincey's apartment was not constitutionally permissible simply because a homicide had recently occurred there.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.291" offset="537126">As to the second issue, we hold for the reasons also spelled out in the court's written opinion that Mincey's statements were not the product of his free and rational choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.151" offset="588535">The Due process of law requires that statements obtained as these were can not be used in anyway against a defendant at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.358" offset="629390">For these reasons, the judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings, not inconsistent with the court's written opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.756" offset="670977">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
