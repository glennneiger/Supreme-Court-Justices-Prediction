            <text syncTime="54.888" offset="299512">Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Members of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.955" offset="315708">This case is here on Certiorari to the Fourth Circuit to review the question, whether a discharged employee who brings action against her former employee under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and seeks as recovery, reinstatement to her position and monetary damages in the form of back pay, is entitled to a jury trial under that Act or under the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.276" offset="453008">The facts are briefly stated in the complaint and that is what we are proceeding on in this case, is that plaintiff was a 48 year-old employee of the defendant company and was terminated from her employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.220" offset="524792">It is alleged that this discharge was because of her age and was a part of the company's policy to terminate where possible older employees and retain where possible younger employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.618" offset="614444">Plaintiff made a timely demand for jury trial and defendant moved to strike the jury demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.266" offset="644955">The District Court granted the motion to strike the demand, principally basing his ruling on the rationale that a Age Discrimination Act was akin to or parallel with Title 7 discrimination of account of race, sex, national origin and religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.856" offset="747355">An interlocutory appeal was granted by the Fourth Circuit and that court reversed the opinion of the District Court, therefore basis of the opinion of the Circuit court, number one, it found in the language of the ADEA, those words 'legal relief' or 'equitable relief' as making a distinction in the Title 7 cases and the court further found or held that the opinion that Curtis v. Loether mandated that kind of a ruling that being a Title 8 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.116" offset="944423">Third, the court felt that as a matter of constitutional right this was -- they were entitled to recover on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.144" offset="996459">The Sixth Circuit in Morelock v. NCR Corp, held to the contrary and petition was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.367" offset="1041390">I might state that pending the case before the Court of Appeal, plaintiff filed a motion in that court to have the case remanded after disposition before the Fourth Circuit to permit plaintiff to amend her complaint to allege that her termination caused her embarrassment, anxiety and constituted grounds for common law of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.715" offset="1202826">The Court of Appeals said that since that matter had been raised for the first time before that court, it should properly be raised only upon remand, it did not find it necessary to pass on the question of whether asking for punitive damages in an ADEA complaint made any difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.802" offset="1331140">Anything to prevent the District Judge from reserving to himself all of the truly equitable decisions, injunctive relief, for example, on relying the jury to deal with the damage issue?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thornton H. Brooks</label>
            <text syncTime="348.335" offset="1473246">Right Sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.994" offset="1487875">And so it is our position that first we have to look at the Legislative Act, the ADEA to see if it provides for a jury trial, if so we do not have to reach the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.064" offset="1556211">The Act itself has no expressed language that even tangent of the late deals with the matter of the jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.235" offset="1588916">It's utterly silent on the question of the jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.378" offset="1605426">In so far as the Legislative History is concerned it does not even rise to the extent of being ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.317" offset="1637190">There is no Legislative History with respect to the jury trial aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.124" offset="1664462">There is a Legislative History about the purpose of the Act, and we consider that the legislative purpose in enacting the Act was to fill in the gap of employment discrimination areas that were not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.120" offset="1736456">It already covered eight, I mean,sex, race, sex, religion, national origin and age was being to be a proper subject to prohibit discrimination in that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.750" offset="1798941">As a matter of fact, Title 7 has a provision authorizing the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.988" offset="1819839">Secretory of Labor to make a investigation and report back to Congress on the needs for that legislation, and that was done.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="443.850" offset="1855365">Mr. Brooks, if the statute had said nothing whatever about jury trail, as it apparently doesn't and if there was absolutely nothing in the Legislative History indicating that Congress intended a jury trial, if nonetheless it had provided for the mandatory award of damages were found under Curtis v. Loether, these people who didn't have a jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.308" offset="1981171">We say 'no' because we say under the teachings of Title 7 cases, that's an incident to the equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.777" offset="2015026">The main relief in the ADEA cases in Title 7 is reinstatement, that is Mrs. Pons wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.093" offset="2048253">She wants to get back her job.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.563" offset="2070196">The matter compensating her for lost wages and earnings -- she of course, didn't presume that but her main request and her main interest in this litigation is to be restored to her position.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="523.514" offset="2173955">Does the Legislative History show Congress elected to enact a separate statute rather than amend Title 7.</text>

          <turn speaker="thornton_h_brooks" startTime="532.262" stopTime="590.431">
            <label>Mr. Thornton H. Brooks</label>
            <text syncTime="532.262" offset="2208959">Not directly this -- there was some suggestion that it be amendment to Title 7 and just include age along with the other categories but there was also some suggestion that before the committees that the EEOC which was charged with the administration of Title 7 was so behind in its caseload, that it would be better to entrust this to the Secretory of Labor which presumably had more time and could handle this aspect of it, but that would be the only indication in there that as to why that was in the separate Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.917" offset="2379590">Some of the commentators have suggested that there maybe not a legal distinction but a psychological distinction between discrimination on account of age and on account of these other factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.796" offset="2499127">Indeed Sir, and Congress now is contemplating moving it up because it figured that it's holding the clock back, I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.687" offset="2546670">So we contend that there is nothing in the Act, even indirectly that speaks to whether there should be a jury trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.092" offset="2584286">Arguably we say that Congress did not intend or contemplate one, otherwise it could have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.696" offset="2614692">In Title 7, where they speak a jury trial in contempt cases, they expressly provide that the party is entitled to jury trial in that instant and so we say that they could have said so in this case if that had been their intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.261" offset="2796923">But then we would move to the constitutional issue and we would stand on this very concise proposition that set forth in the latest case of this court Pernell v. Southall Realty, where justice Marshall said that trial by jury and actions unheard of a common law permitted by are required by the Seventh Amendment provided that the action involves rights and remedies of this sort traditionally enforced in the action at law rather than in an action at equity or admity and all difference between the parties in this case is whether this is an action that traditionally would be brought in equity or in law.</text>

Delaware which was a Title 7 case where request to jury trial was turned down and not that -- not granting the certiorari means anything but the courts are looking to this court for guidance on whether in discrimination litigations, party is entitled to trial and if it is our basic position that when you finally analyze the cases, there is no real difference from the standpoint of remedies and rights in an action brought under Title 7 in ADEA.</text>

Albemarle Paper Co. and the language in Boman Transportation, we think clearly say that back wages, lost wages do not have to automatically be granted and within the discretion of the court and therefore they are merely an incident to the main relief asked for and it is not cited in our brief but I would call the court's attention to the latest announcement of this court on the matter of jury, is in Atlas Roofing Company which was in, March of this year and as I read Footnote number 10, it says that going back to Jones &amp; Laughlin, this is an alternate ground, it's a separate ground as to whether or not that that case was based on, that recovery of money damages is an incident to the non-legal relief even though damages might have been recovered in an action at law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.438" offset="4997687">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.716" offset="5010748">I read the briefs of petitioner and its amicus with care and listened to oral argument to try to see if there was some way that the meaning of a statute when it says legal or equitable relief could be rendered nugatory and I have failed to find that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.190" offset="5088697">I think that the Third, Fourth and Fifth Circuits are correct and the Sixth Circuit is wrong in the way in which the lower courts have dealt with this jury trial question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.137" offset="5140524">The statute clearly says legal or equitable relief can be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.565" offset="5166229">The statute goes on to give certain examples of all types of relief, examples set forth in the statute of equitable relief include compelling employment, reinstatement and promotion and to me, the example of legal relief that the stature on its face contains is enforcing liability for amounts deemed, unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation, and in doing this the court has -- the Congress has incorporated by reference, Section 260 in the private remedy provision of the Fair Labor standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.481" offset="5345847">The lower court cases over the last 30 years interpreting the Section 216 are unanimous in holding that a jury trial right does obtain under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.480" offset="5401853">We feel that this judicial construction history must have been in the mind of Congress when it passed the law that we have here, when it was incorporated by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.062" offset="5460159">We feel that not only do we have the items of relief deemed, unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation, not only do we have these forms of relief as legal relief but we feel that other forms of relief provided by the statute or the statute as interpreted by the courts would also be legal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.132" offset="5580426">Among these would be included in my view the statutory liquidated damages which is posited on a finding of willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.542" offset="5622118">I further feel that actual damages or payment suffering an injury to reputation maybe recoverable under the statute and furthermore that common law of punitive damages maybe recoverable under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.902" offset="5671541">The court of course does not need to reach the question as to precisely what kinds of damages are recoverable because that does not arise in the scope of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.707" offset="5930781">I think we find in our society that we don't have a pervasive prejudice against elderly people, mindless sort of a prejudice that we found against persons of alien extraction or persons of minority races that we dealt with in Title 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.707" offset="6014790">Well, that's somewhat different type of prejudice but because our society is one that's dominated by males, I am inclined to think that this is a type of prejudice which is very pervasive and very malevolent and often very hard to detect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.810" offset="6091172">And I suppose the framers of Title 7 felt that because such prejudices are so widely here, there might be jury nullification of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.669" offset="6134640">This is suggested in some of the Legislative History as well as in some of the law review articles that have been published on the subject. I am of the view that -- same view that was expressed by this court in Curtis v. Loether that such considerations cannot overwrite the Seventh Amendment but I again emphasize that that is not the case that the court has before it and happily we don't seem to be concerned with jury nullification because all the plaintiffs in age cases want jurys and all the defendants don't want jurys.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.941" offset="7379741">Well, I am very strongly of the opinion that there are limitations on the power of Congress to deny litigants their Seventh Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.986" offset="7431881">They may have done so under Title 7 happily that case is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.078" offset="7452257">We respectfully contend that because legal relief is set forth on the face of the statute and illustrative types of legal relief are also set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.766" offset="7507009">We don't think that there is any reason for the court to engage in the statutory construction by using extrinsic aids to construction and hence we see no reason for the court even to look at Title 7 in this case, but where the court to do so, the differences between the statutes are very dramatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.318" offset="7585168">Under Title 7 Congress went to considerable length to deliberately exclude jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.102" offset="7612335">The statute allows only for equitable relief on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.249" offset="7624874">The statutory history including the floor debates and committee reports are replete with statements that there will be no trial by jury except in the narrow area of criminal contempts that came in pursuant to the Dirksen-Mansfield series of amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.194" offset="7700733">Also it's instructive that back pay under the Title 7 is said maybe awarded by the court and not that it must be that but that it maybe to discretionary matter whereas the amounts deemed unpaid minimum wages and unpaid overtime compensation apparently must be awarded by the way the Age Discrimination Act is phrased.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.551" offset="7914101">Yes sir, and it's very important to note that the Portal Act provision which allow similar liquidated damages under the FLSA was not carried forward into Age Act, under the Portal Act there's a discretionary provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.554" offset="7994141">The court had discretion to grant or deny liquidated damages depending on whether or not the court finds the defendant acted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.240" offset="8024861">Here I think, Congress is telling us, let's let the jury decide whether or not the defendants was willful because the word discretion nowhere appears on the face of the Age Act and the Portal Act was not incorporated by reference as many of the other provisions of the FLSA were, turning --</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.463" offset="8117752">Did you tell us Mr. Smith whether or not the Fourth Circuit has decided that there is a right to jury trial in Title 7 cases and if you didn't tell us would you?</text>

          <turn speaker="norman_b_smith" startTime="2022.735" stopTime="2343.760">
            <label>Mr. Norman B. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2022.735" offset="8170833">The Fourth Circuit appears to join with virtually all other courts holding that there is no jury trail right, and they have even done so in some employment discrimination cases arising under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.254" offset="8232900">I don't think those cases any longer can be sustained in light of the Fourth Circuit's decision in Pons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.746" offset="8258918">I am saying those public employment cases, I am not saying, of course of Title 7 cases which is a different animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.554" offset="8286190">Turning briefly to the constitutional issue which I don't think the court really needs to reach, I think it's a statutory construction problem but nonetheless the court should consider the constitutionality of jury trail in this case, we would say that this appears to be certainly one of those cases in which the seventh Amendment requires a jury trial to be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.463" offset="8401755">I think what the petitioners are tempting to do here is to reinstate the now defunct equitable cleanup doctrine and to ask that the damages consisting of lost wages be tried as an adjunct to the claim for equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.464" offset="8489736">This clearly said in Beacon Theaters and Ross v. Bernhard that the right to jury trail will not be lost by trial of the equitable issues to the court in treating the legal issues merely as an incidental to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.384" offset="8549504">In Ross, there were the three tests identified for the purpose of assisting the court in establishing whether jury trials must be granted or not in a given context, one was whether the claim was legal or equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.718" offset="8614810">I take it the petitioner really doesn't raise much of an issue here, I think the petitioner essentially concedes that respondent's claim is a legal claim because it so neatly fits in to the common law analog of the breach of contract of employment in the action for damages, as a result there are and further taking a suggestion from this court's decision in Curtis v. Loether, I suppose one could also say that a new statutory tort was created consisting of discrimination in employment and that this is somewhat akin to the common law cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress which is to tried on the law side and not on the equitable side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.419" offset="8813654">I find no pre-merger equitable antecedent to the cause of action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.131" offset="8840403">The second inquiry required by Ross is whether the remedy is legal or equitable and we respectfully submit that the remedy here sought is a legal one, at least the remedy for lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.737" offset="8906859">Petitioner argued that reinstatement was the primary relief sought by the respondent, that's not necessarily so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.165" offset="8936639">Two years have gone by now and it's really not necessarily true that by the time this case ultimately comes to trail the respondent will either wish to or be in a position to try and have her job back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.998" offset="8987943">And certainly it's conceptually possible that that would be -- that claim would be withdrawn before the action comes to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.228" offset="9028799">What respondent has particularly asked for here is her damages consisting of lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.605" offset="9058369">This is a classic legal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.037" offset="9072057">The lost wages under the Age Act are not discretionary as petitioner argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.130" offset="9096403">They are mandated by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.253" offset="9104972">The Act uses the word shall and not may and it incorporates all of this history of construction under the FLSA, all of which holds that such damages are automatic and calculable with precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.137" offset="9168501">Furthermore the claims for punitive or liquidated damages are historically unavailable and equally unavailable on the law side and these remedies as well would indicate that our claim here is want to be tried by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.134" offset="9228479">The third and final element expressed in Ross is whether the action could be managed as a jury case given their practical limitations, we would respectfully submit that this type cases are ideal for resolution by jury as Justice Stevens noted in the Curtis case at the Circuit court level, such cases as these deal primarily with motive and credibility which are classic issues for jury resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.786" offset="9363061">Computation of damages is relatively simple and straightforward and even in our own district we have the history that two cases have been tried by jury and that then this case came along and the jury demand was stricken so we know that you can't try these cases by jury because in our district, we tried two of them, in fact I was counsel for plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="2514.124" offset="10136390">One or two words on the matter of liquidated damages to which we were just devoting our attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.582" offset="10170245">Mr. Smith, before the District Court and was so interpreted before the Court of Appeals that he made no claim that that issue was triable by jury, that's found in the petition for certiorari in the decisions of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.302" offset="10245164">Before the District Court had in Footnote Two on page 8a and in the Court of Appeals on page 2a, in Footnote Three where it states this appeal involves only the right to jury trial on the claim of lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.647" offset="10330532">Mr. Smith has stated that in our argument we had made no mention about the wording and the act of legal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.742" offset="10394898">I might say that without exaggeration that ADEA is not a hallmark of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.249" offset="10432932">They have the language in that that says you can enforce the liability for amounts deemed to the unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.071" offset="10488208">They make that statement in two places in Section 7b, and there's no way possible that you can have unpaid wages or overtime compensation under a ADEA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.645" offset="10558529">This was barred from the language of FLSA case, the standard case where the only issue was the employee paid the minimum wages if not, they were entitled to a definite amount to bring that wages up to the minimum wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.976" offset="10639822">If the other part of the overtime compensation under the fairly the Standards Act, if you worked over 40 hours and did not pay time and they have to regulerate those hours, you are automatically entitled to a judgment for that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.513" offset="10705964">That was a fixed amount that not capable of ascertainment within the discretion of any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.408" offset="10749537">Furthermore, my brother Mr. Smith says that we do not discuss what legal relief means, I would call his attention, the court's attention to his opposition for the petition for certiorari on page 7 in the third paragraph, when he states that “The term legal relief set out in the Age Discrimination and Employment Act clearly relates to the enumerated remedy of 'enforcing the liability for amounts deemed to the unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation under this section', and also may relate to other types of legal claims such as common law damage claims which are not specifically enumerated in the statute”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.208" offset="10944723">But we are not dealing with unpaid minimum wages or overtime, we are dealing with a claim for back wages, lost wages, and in conclusion I would say that we -- if a jury trial is permissible in an ADEA case, and is not permissible in the Title 7 case, we end up in the anomalous situation that Mrs. Pons being a female, an old age party could have coupled both actions in both claims in her complaint and she would have been entitled to a jury trail and therefore but if she brought only a Title 7 case, she would not have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.210" offset="11140746">We feel that this is all a part of Congress's intent to put discrimination cases in the same basket or category and the same kind of result should obtain with respect to whether her part is entitled to a jury trail.</text>
