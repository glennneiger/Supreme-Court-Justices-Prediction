            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="98.272" offset="472974">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.524" offset="486035">The Court granted certiorari in this case to resolve two important issues of Federal Criminal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.486" offset="509859">The first is whether a defendant may appeal prior to trial from the denial of his motions to dismiss and indictment on Speedy trial grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.906" offset="543609">The second issue which need only be reached if the Court holds that such interlocutory appeals are permissible, is whether the period after Criminal charges against the defendant have been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.659" offset="586555">But before the same or related charges are re-instituted against them should be considered in determining whether the defendant has been prior to his right to Speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.086" offset="628246">Their facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.446" offset="637755">In the early morning of February 17 1970, Respondent's wife and two small daughters were clubbed and stabbed to death in Respondent's Apartment on the Fort Bragg Military Reservation in North Carolina where respondent was assigned as a Medical Doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.694" offset="702747">Respondent who also suffered some woulds notified the military police of the attacks, claiming that he and his family had been assaulted by force so called hippies who were apparently been under the influence of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.514" offset="753947">Respondent at first was viewed as a victim rather that as a suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.793" offset="771084">However after an intensive but incomplete investigation of the crimes, had been conducted by the CID the Army's Criminal Investigative Unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.892" offset="807550">It became apparent that many aspects of Respondent's version of the attacks and of the subsequent actions upon discovering his family's bodies could not be squared with the preliminary laboratory analysis of the physical evidence of the Crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.942" offset="867737">In April 1970 therefore respondent was warned that he was a suspect in the murders was advised of his rights by military authorities and was confined to the military reservation by his immediate commanding officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.186" offset="916638">Three weeks later, respondent was formally charged by his commander with three specifications of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.957" offset="943805">As required by Article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, an officer Colonel Warren Rock was appointed to investigate the matter and to recommend whether the charges should be referred by the post commander to a General Court Marshal for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.134" offset="1008484">After considering the other evidence on the case over the next several months Colonel Rock recommended that the charges against the respondent be dismissed but that further investigation of the murders be undertaken by the appropriate Civilian authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.937" offset="1063655">This recommendation was accepted by the Commanding General of respondent's unit who dismissed all charges against respondent in October 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.202" offset="1100749">Two months later, in December 1970 respondent was granted an honorable discharge by the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.540" offset="1130110">Following respondent's release from the military the Department of Justice requested the CID to continue its investigation in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.862" offset="1163338">The CID did so and in June 1972 it submitted a massive 13 volume report to the department, which was supplemented by further reports in November 1972 and August 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.438" offset="1217673">Respondent was eventually indicted on three counts of murder in January 1975 by grand jury of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.739" offset="1262917">Respondent moved to dismiss the indictment on a number of grounds including Double Jeopardy and denial of the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.771" offset="1294995">The District Court denied each of these motions in July 1975 and schedule respondent's trial to begin in August 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.084" offset="1332298">Respondent instead took an immediate appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.274" offset="1357062">That Court held that it had jurisdiction over respondent's Double Jeopardy claim under its decisions in United States against Lansdowne.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.059" offset="1384125">The decisions subsequently approved by this Court in Abney against the United States and that respondents Speedy trial claim was also a proper subject for a pre-trail appellate review because it involved the fundamental constitutional right because of his”pendent to the double Jeopardy claim and closely related to it” and because the court believed that its ruling on the issue would expedite the ultimate resolution of what it viewed as an extraordinary case.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="350.272" offset="1480987">What case is from this Court did the Fourth Circuit cite to support its concept of pendent Jurisdiction over the Speedy trial.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="358.921" stopTime="466.885">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="358.921" offset="1515573">My recollection Mr. Justice Rehnquist is that it cited none.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.239" offset="1536889">That aspect of the Court of Appeals decisions is at page 5a, the appendix of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.709" offset="1566773">The Court then concluded on the merits that respondent had been denied the Speedy trial on the merits because of the delay of more than four-and-half years between his arrest by the Army in May 1970, and his Federal indictment in January 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.700" offset="1630721">It viewed as of no significance for Sixth Amendment purposes that respondent had not been under any criminal charges for more than four years at that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.608" offset="1670323">Now, the threshold question in this case is whether the Court of Appeals had Jurisdiction to review respondent's pre-trail appeal for the denial of the Speedy trial motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.863" offset="1707417">We submit that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.186" offset="1716716">Under the controlling Jurisdictional Statute 28 USC 1291 the Courts of Appeal may review only final decisions of the District Court's.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.422" offset="1753601">A phrase that this Court has consistently construed to bar piecemeal appeals before final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.517" offset="1778052">Adherence to this rule of finality has particularly stringent in criminal cases because the delays and disruptions caused by interlocutory appeals are especially inimical to the effective administration of the Criminal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.725" offset="1826848">Respondent of course, does not claimed that the pre-trail denial of his motions to dismiss the indictment on Speedy trial grounds was a final decisions, in the sense that it terminated the proceedings against him in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.499" offset="1877944">Obviously the Court's ruling only allowed the case to proceed the trial where a number of other factors may have led to to dismissal on acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.070" offset="1908246">Rather respondent contends that the denial of the Speedy trial motion is immediately appealable before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.046" offset="1932070">Under the so called collateral order exception to the final judgment.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="466.885" offset="1947430">Could the speedy trial claim had been presented a new to the District Court in a motion for judgment NOV or judgment of acquittal of the conclusion if the guilty verdict had been retained?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="477.740" stopTime="829.796">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="477.740" offset="1990897">Yes, it can and it is our position that that would be the preferable way in which to present it because as I will get to in a moment, it is often impossible to rule on such a motion until you see what the evidence is a trial because frequently the defendant's contentions would be that he has been prejudiced in his ability to defend himself by the delay that might have been caused by the the government and it is only after trial that such a claim can be intelligently assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.861" offset="2111374">And this court most recently applied the collateral order doctrine, last term in Abney against the United States in holding that the Courts of Appeals had jurisdiction under Section 1291 to entertain interlocutory appeal from the denial to dismiss an indictment because of Double Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.183" offset="2180651">In reaching that conclusion the court stressed that the trial judge's pre-trial denial of the Double Jeopardy motion constituted a complete formal and final rejection of the Fifth Amendment claim in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.559" offset="2230179">But the claim by its very nature was wholly collateral to and separable from the issues to be litigated at the trial and that the most important is the protection is been preferred on an accused by the double jeopardy clause would be significantly undermined if appellate review had to wait until after conviction because the Double Jeopardy clause protects an individual not only against being punished twice for the same offense but also against being tried twice for that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.540" offset="2334146">That aspect of the constitutional right could not be indicated by reversal of any conviction obtained at the second trial and would be irreparably lost unless an immediate pre-trail appeal were permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.127" offset="2384406">We have explained at some length in our brief why the denial prior to trial of a speedy trial motion unlike the denial of the double jeopardy motion is not normally a final rejection of the claim in the District Court, because as I just explained in response to the question by Mr. Justice Rehnquist, an intelligent application of the bar for viewing those standards often may not be possible before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.087" offset="2472282">For many of the same reasons speedy trial claim again unlike double jeopardy claims are not wholly collateral to the matters to the raise the trial because only after the trial can it be determined whether the defendant has truly been prejudiced by pre trial delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.110" offset="2528393">Respondents has not seriously disputed these contentions in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.486" offset="2545843">Instead he asserts that Sixth Amendment Speedy Trial clause just like Fifth Amendment double jeopardy clause creates a so called right not to be tried, a right which to be effective requires recognition of the concomitant right to immediate appellate review, but there is a little to support this assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.479" offset="2617836">As the language of the Sixth Amendment suggests that is the delay before trial and not the trial itself that violates the constitutional guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.612" offset="2650332">The concern of the Sixth Amendment is not the trial but the any delays surrounding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.382" offset="2669454">If the pertinent factors identified in Barker v. Wingo in a particular case to deprive the defendant of his right to a Speedy Trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.318" offset="2701219">That violation by definition must have occurred prior to the beginning of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.683" offset="2718669">Hence unlike the situation in Abney proceeding with the trial itself would not cause or compound the constitutional deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.586" offset="2750329">By the same token and again by contrast to the Fifth Amendment protection against Double Jeopardy, the effectiveness of appellate review of Speedy Trial claims is not diminished in any way by awaiting the outcome of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.858" offset="2803410">This court is identified three interests of a defendant that the Speedy Trial clause is designed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.387" offset="2829532">First, to prevent the oppressive pretrial incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.212" offset="2844788">Second, to minimize pretrial anxiety and concern of the accused and third to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired by the loss of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.709" offset="2886793">It is obvious that no remedy whenever offered can truly undo or alleviate the annoyances or anxieties that a defendant may have suffered while awaiting trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.637" offset="2926499">But the reversal of defendant's conviction after trial would be equally as effective as the dismissal of indictment before trial to compensate that defendant for any emotional harm he may have suffered and it will also be equally as effective as a means of punishing the government for the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.540" offset="2990133">Similarly, a defendant's interest in avoiding a conviction based on lost evidence or dimmed memories can be fully protected by a reversal of any conviction procured after a period of unconstitutional pretrial delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.492" offset="3045931">Thus deferring appeal of a rejected Speedy Trial claim until after trial presents a question not of rights, but solely of remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.151" offset="3076546">Any Sixth Amendment violation can be remedied as well after trial as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.899" offset="3099534">Now, since Speedy Trial claims thus do not satisfy any of the criteria of the collateral law order doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.121" offset="3124403">There is no justification for countenancing a breach of the normal rules against interlocutory appeals and criminal cases for such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.187" offset="3156690">Indeed there are strong reasons why in our view would be a especially inappropriate to allow defendants to take interlocutory remedy appeals from the District Courts denial of their Speedy Trial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.812" offset="3203188">That is because the Speedy Trial clause unlike the Double Jeopardy clause or indeed unlike any of the other protections of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.133" offset="3232445">It is designed as much to foster the interest of society in the expeditious resolution of criminal cases as to confer protections upon individual defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.415" offset="3273614">This court observed in Barker v. Wingo the societal interest in providing a Speedy Trial exist not only separate from but at times also in opposition to the interest of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.978" offset="3315828">Thus, even if some of the interest protected by the Speedy Trial clause might be furthered by allowing pretrial appellate review of Sixth Amendment claims in a occasional case, other equally important interest protected by the clause would be severely frustrated by the often substantial delays in the disposition of criminal cases that would inevitably accompany such appeals.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="829.796" offset="3399106">There would certainly be pretrial review if the shoe were on the other foot or they are not if the defendant had moved the indictment be dismissed because to try them now would violate his right to a Speedy Trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.138" offset="3456471">The government could surely appeal that.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.139" offset="3468488">That is correct but under Section 1291, under Section 3731 from the dismissal of indictment and that clearly is a final order.</text>

          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="854.539" stopTime="1006.231">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="854.539" offset="3498058">There is nothing further that would happen in the case unless an appeal were to be pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.265" offset="3516971">Like this case graphically illustrates the point that I was making about delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.044" offset="3532122">The District Court denied respondent's motions to dismiss the indictment in July 1975 and scheduled his trial to begin a few weeks later.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.001" offset="3567962">Pretrial litigation of respondent's Speedy Trial claims is yet to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.236" offset="3584889">More that two years after his trial would have ended but for the "piecemeal" appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.871" offset="3607459">In addition permitting pretrial appeal of Speedy Trial claims would allow defendants a ready method of obtaining a continuance of their trials and delay is unfortunately not an uncommon defense tactic.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.750" offset="3658972">We have recognized of course that this court in Abney was not persuaded by the argument that the defendants might take dilatory appeals in Double Jeopardy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.581" offset="3698261">The Court believed that the Courts of Appeals could easily weed out and dispose summarily of truly frivolous kept claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.677" offset="3726682">Well, this is perhaps true in double jeopardy cases there are two reasons why it is exceedingly unlikely to be true with respect to speedy trail claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.474" offset="3761790">First is that it is much more difficult to allege a plausible double jeopardy violation, there must be some showing that the defendant has once before been in jeopardy a federal conviction on the same or related charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.962" offset="3807766">Very few defendants could make or even approach that challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.468" offset="3821768">By contrast, it would be the rare defendant who could not present the colorable speedy trail claims since they will be in every case some period of delay between his arrest and indictment and trail and possible prejudices, as this court remarked in United States V. Marion is inherent in any delay however short.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.887" offset="3895433">Secondly, it is much easier for Courts of Appeals to spot and adjudicate any substantial double jeopardy claim quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.740" offset="3926884">It involves merely a question of law generally on undisputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.816" offset="3947155">Speedy trail claims on the other hand call for a delicate and often difficult case by case assessment of a number of variables such as the reasons for the delay and the prejudice suffered as the result of the delay, whether these factors make out a constitutional violation in any particular case may not be possible to determine without the aid of full briefing and oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.948" offset="4031688">In short, we submit that speedy trail claims are precisely the type of claims that should be subject to the final judgment rule and that the Court of Appeals erred in hearing respondents speedy trail appeal prior to trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.097" offset="4088321">I would like to turn briefly the few minutes remaining to the merits of respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.706" offset="4158747">Why does not the appeal on the Double Jeopardy issue support review of the speedy trail issue?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="1026.242" offset="4184870">Well, this court in Abney was faced with a similar situation, in Abney you will recall not only was there an appeal of the double jeopardy claim but the defendants also claimed that the indictment failed to state an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.326" offset="4229278">The District Court denied that motion, they took an appeal of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.797" offset="4239100">Also before trail this court held that this court held that the Court of Appeals held no jurisdiction over that aspect of the defendants appeal because each issue must need its own independent appealability standard there is no concept of pendent jurisdiction has no role to play under the collateral order doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.422" offset="4317676">Now, as to the merits of respondent's Sixth Amendment claim as I noted at the outset this court need not reach it if it agrees with us that the court below lacked jurisdiction over respondents pretrial appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.105" offset="4368354">Now, the Court of Appeal acknowledged and indeed as respondent concedes, no significant delay and certainly no delay approaching constitutional magnitude occurred in this case between January 1975, when respondent was indicted in August 1975 when his trail was set to begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.022" offset="4452050">Court of Appeals holding that respondent was deprived of his right to a speedy trail, thus plainly rests on the premise that respondent's Sixth Amendment right attached in the Spring of 1970 when he was arrested by the army and that is right continued unabated until August 1975, even though all of the military charges against respondent had been dismissed and he had been released from all restrains on his liberty in October of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.727" offset="4562809">Court below has therefore reached the insupportable and quite incongruous conclusion that in the four years between the dismissal of the military charges against respondent and his indictment, respondent was entitled to insist upon a prompt resolution of the charges against them and the federal government was obliged by the Sixth Amendment to afford him a speedy trail on those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.687" offset="4646715">Despite the fact that absolutely no criminal charges were pending against him during any part of that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.817" offset="4671165">This holding we submit is flatly inconsistent not only with the very language of the Sixth Amendment with talks about an accused in a criminal prosecution but also with analysis of that provision in United States against Marion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.874" offset="4727381">In Marion the Court held that the particular protections of the Sixth Amendment did not extend to the period before an individual had been formally accused of a crime either by arrest or indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.034" offset="4768027">Even though that individual may have been aware for an extended period of time prior to his indictment that he was under official investigation and even though he may have suffered severe harmful emotional and financial consequences as a result of that investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.582" offset="4826228">It is we believe the logical corollary of these conclusion that as defendant's Sixth Amendment right also did not continue after a criminal proceeding against him has been terminated by a complete dismissal of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.663" offset="4878577">At that point just like a advance of formal accusation the individual does not stand publicly accused of any crime and his liberty is in no way restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.610" offset="4918388">His situation, as the Court observed in Marion does not compare with that of the defendant who has been arrested and held to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.514" offset="4954019">Now respondent's only response to these arguments is the assertion that his case is essentially indistinguishable from that in Klopfer against North Carolina in 386 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.032" offset="5000099">Klopfer however presented the question and I am quoting from page 214 of the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.852" offset="5023296">Whether authorities “may indefinitely postpone prosecution on an incitement without stated justification over the objection of an accused”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.053" offset="5064151">The unusual North Carolina procedure in Klopfer allowed the State prosecutor to postpone prosecution indefinitely on an incitement that he did not wish to pursue immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.475" offset="5105843">The upshot was that since the indictment was not dismissed during awaiting period, the Statute of limitations remain told and the defendant remained under formal public acquisition and under the constant threat of prosecution at the option of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.725" offset="5166865">This Court held that the State procedure violated Klopfer's right to a speedy trial but only because, as the Court stated at page 222, the suspension of his prosecution “indefinitely prolonged the oppression as well as the anxiety and concern accompanying public acquisition”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.268" offset="5241052">Respondent of course was under any public acquisition between October 1970 and January 1975, nothing in Klopfer therefore supports an extension of the speedy trial clause to the period when an individual is not the subject of any pending criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.826" offset="5319211">I should add one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.623" offset="5326421">The conclusion that respondent's Sixth Amendment right were not violated by the five year period between the murders of his family in 1970 and his indictment for those crimes in 1975, certainly does not suggest that the propriety of that delay is beyond judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.813" offset="5403221">There is first the protection of the Statute of limitations which is of course the primary guarantee against the bringing of overly stale criminal charges but there is no suggestion that the Statute was violated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.214" offset="5452749">And moreover as this Court observed in Marion and reaffirmed last term in United States against Lovasco, the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment is an additional protection against unreasonable pre indictment delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.189" offset="5508651">A lengthy delay prior to acquisition violates due process if it causes actual prejudice to the defense and if the Government's justification for the delay is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.698" offset="5554731">Although the Court of Appeals did not undertake this analysis, we believe that the District Court and the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals correctly found that the Due Process clause was not violated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.624" offset="5598408">Indeed respondent does not contend otherwise, respondent has never claimed that the Government's delay in this case was designed to prejudice his defense or was occasioned by tactical reasons and as we have set forth that some length in our main and reply briefs, there is not the slightest proof at this pretrial stage that respondent's defense has actually been prejudiced by the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.737" offset="5686910">We therefore submit that the Court should vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals with instructions to dismiss respondent's speedy trial claim for lack of jurisdiction, so that this case may finally proceed to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.289" offset="5733095">Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.929" offset="5851691">As it seems to me that the Solicitor General's argument has consciously averted some rather I think point in significant findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.629" offset="5894427">Not my facts that Your Honors pleases but the facts found by the Court of Appeals and the facts found in the most extraordinary military proceeding that precipitated this case in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.656" offset="5946568">The case does start in February the 17th, 1970 with the murders of MacDonald family, the wife and children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.692" offset="5982721">The wounds that Dr. MacDonald referred to by the solicitor of course were testified to at the military proceedings by the both the Government's doctors and the defense doctors, as being life threatening wounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.461" offset="6029741">The reason for of course was that the one of the Government's multiple theories of trying to explain the case was that these were self inflicted by the accused Dr. MacDonald to cover up murder that he had committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.309" offset="6081150">In fact the record failed to support that and the conclusion of the military presiding officer in 1970 was that Dr. MacDonald had told the truth, those were his words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.653" offset="6134545">Most extraordinarily which the Government has referred to a great length are the facts from this 1970 military proceedings is that nowhere in the Solicitor General's brief, nowhere in the Solicitor General's argument, does he share with the Court the two and the only two findings that were made by --</text>

            <text syncTime="2040.523" offset="8241999">In its reply brief the government returns to the description of speedy trial claim and says such a plea sets up by way of defense acclaimed at bar's conviction whether or not the defendant is guilty and this Court Mr. White writing for the Court in Marion echoes exactly the same language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2129.874" offset="8599459">First of all there have been 29 years that relapses the Cohen doctrine was first articulated which means that for 29 years defendants and defense lawyers in criminal cases apparently are to presumed to be aware that they could have sought interlocutory appeals from the denial of Speedy Trial claims by District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.435" offset="8673647">As the government points out in its brief there are only two reported cases that we can find in the 29 years of the Cohen case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2553.076" offset="10292194">But he erred and the Court of Appeals found the err when he said that the public acquisition in this case had not taken place until January 1975 when the indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.062" offset="10336184">As judges Burstner (ph) and Russel found in the Court of Appeals, the public acquisition had taken place in April of 1970, in May of 1970, when the government called a press conference and announce the formal charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="2663.470" offset="10733768">That is the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.974" offset="10739828">Now I might say in its brief to this court the government has shifted now to what is now its third position on what caused the delay in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2675.638" offset="10782460">I am profoundly surprised that counsel for the government would get up to this court and say and see the MacDonald itself is an absolute example of the delay that defendants could bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.493" offset="10837944">I have set forth at page 40 the proceedings in which the government has dragged its foot, been late, extended time and doubled the extended time asked for unprecedented extensions of time to file motions and briefs that are not allowed in the court of appeals, has asked for double time to file petitions for extension to this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.156" offset="10908579">It is set out in Footnote at the page 40 y in the name of Habin (ph).</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.905" offset="10975557">The court of appeals found that there were two-and-half years in this case which absolutely nothing of significance took place in the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.049" offset="11016099">The chronology of this case was that the charges were finally dismissed in the October of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.794" offset="11047132">Now, we contend, it is position if Your Honor please that those dismissal by General Flanagan constitutes Double Jeopardy but since as not the issue here arguendo will take the governments position that it was not final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.566" offset="11098228">The government in fact proceeded reasonably promptly after that dismissal to restart the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.537" offset="11122052">In January of '71 just less than two-and-half months later, a new team of military investigators were assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.840" offset="11147338">As a matter of fact ten investigators were assigned full time for one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.649" offset="11162489">They worked in to December of '71.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.707" offset="11174715">We find no fault with that proceeding in the course of those eleven-and-half months, they reinterviewed every witness in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.361" offset="11205330">They have reinterviewed 699 witnesses, they did a reinvestigation job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.189" offset="11224661">We do not find any fault with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.047" offset="11232079">Either to the Court of Appeals but from December of 1971 and until the return of the indictment, there is no significant activity by the government nothing that justifies it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.850" offset="11279309">The investigators took about six months to write a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.423" offset="11293624">That even that was in the hands of the Justice Department in the June of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.967" offset="11315776">Again the Court of Appeal thought it was interesting to read the government's own words, not only bureaucracy explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.504" offset="11342003">But the Court of Appeals made reference to the affidavit given by the government of Kevin Moroney, an Assistant Attorney General in the criminal division.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.258" offset="11372932">Moroney was purporting to explain why once this massive data, two complete sets of investigations, thorough work by every member of the military involved, why the Justice Department then did nothing from June of 1972 until the Grand Jury was convened in August of 74.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.273" offset="11453075">And in the affidavit of Mr. Moroney, the Court of Appeal cited, we have this report and we assigned it to lawyers and we reassigned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.707" offset="11486721">Those are were Mr. Moroney's words we assigned it and reassigned it, we reviewed and re-reviewed it, and nobody made a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.421" offset="11513575">No one did anything. As a matter of fact the Solicitor General concedes in his argument and he knows the facts, and we know the fact, only two pieces of investigative work took place after December 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.418" offset="11569581">They were explained in the brief they are trivial, have nothing to do with the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.375" offset="11585464">Nothing has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.174" offset="11592674">What really was the explanation was that no one wanted to make a decision, that is clear from the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.996" offset="11615870">We can tell you we know that is the reason, it was possible by three independent pieces of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.017" offset="11640008">One Colonel Rock had to make a finding in this case Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.270" offset="11652964">He had sat through six month of proceedings, he wrote 2000 page record in five weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.825" offset="11675221">He prepared a 90 page summary of findings and conclusions and details which have never been challenged, which the government accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.074" offset="11700194">He made his decision in five weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.339" offset="11709284">Later on, a new U.S. attorney took over this case in Eastern District of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.841" offset="11731332">Now he took over whole of office, he was not even in the office prior to his taking that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.192" offset="11752752">In the matter of four months, he not only took control on office, he finished a 56 page report to the Justice Department and said, “I want to go ahead and prosecute Macdonald, send me trial lawyer”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.654" offset="11794548">What in march of 1972 did the Justice Department do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.655" offset="11810535">It sent it to another lawyer to review the report, he had just finished 56 page evaluation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.147" offset="11876572">Finally, last example, in May of 1974 the case finally wound up on the hands, now some four years after the crime, nearly two years after the CID had finished its reinvestigation in the hands of Victor Wahrheit(ph) another staff attorney.</text>

          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="3320.598" stopTime="3460.471">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3320.598" offset="13362313">Mr. Chief Justice, first briefly I would like to address the suggestion that the government somehow been inconsistent, the position we are taking in this case and the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.286" offset="13397108">We took in Marion that whether speedy trial claim is collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.396" offset="13413513">Threshold issue in Marion, there was a appealability issue whether the government could appeal under the old version of Section 3731 and that in turn depended upon whether the District Court's dismissal of the indictment had resolved any issues going to the general issue in the case. Of course, a speedy trial issue is collateral to the issues to be litigated a trial in the sense that a resolution of the Sixth Amendment question does not require inquiry and the truth of the allegations in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.756" offset="13518943">But we think the court must have meant something more than that when it used the term collateral in Cohen and Abney or else virtually any pretrial motion to dismiss would be collateral as Mr. Justice Marshall's stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.475" offset="13561888">We think that the Court meant that an issue was collateral if it would be no easier to resolve the issue after trial than before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.829" offset="13591250">In other words would it be affected in any way by the decision on the merits of the case and speedy trial claims would be as I mentioned earlier, if the defendant is acquitted then not only is there no need to resolve the claim but it goes a long way towards suggesting that his allegations are prejudice were not substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.588" offset="13662303">More importantly if he is convicted then the record, the trial record is generally indispensable in determining whether or not his Sixth Amendment rights have been violated and no better proof of this need be offered than that the Courts Of Appeals almost always resolve post conviction appeals raising speedy trial claims by reference to the evidence that used the trial, as of course this court did in the Barker v. Wingo in analyzing Barker speedy trial claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.101" offset="13776301">Now, secondly, its true that the remedy for a speedy trial violation is dismissal of the indictment but that does not indicate -- Sixth Amendment creates a so called right not to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.871" offset="13819456">The difficulty with respondent's reasoning once again is that, dismissal of the indictment is the remedy for wide range of violations both constitutional and non-constitutional such as all those involving defects in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.432" offset="13869715">If interlocutory appeals would have been allowed in each of these cases under the theory that the nature of the remedy implies a right not to be tried, then the collateral order exception would swallow up the final judgment law in criminal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.348" offset="14037317">And secondly, the argument that the nature of the remedy in Sixth Amendment cases implies a right not to be tried is inconsistent with this court's decision last term in Abney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.841" offset="14075351">As I mentioned in response to question Mr Justice Stevens asked me initially, in that case in addition to a double jeopardy claim the defendants also raised the claim that their indictment failed to state an offense, and if they had been right of course then the remedy would have been dismissal of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.828" offset="14135224">Nonetheless, this court held that is not the type of claim that can be appealed prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.526" offset="14158003">Finally, I would like to discuss the reasons for the delay in this case because Mr Segal has used a large portion of his argument trying to explain why the delay was unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.973" offset="14207844">I think it is fair to say that much of the delay in this case was attributable to the strong feeling on the part of many persons in the criminal division of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.937" offset="14247655">The charges are serious as the ones in this case, simply should not be brought unless the Government was absolutely convinced that they would ultimately prove successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.255" offset="14288928">To begin with, we are not talking about a five year delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.955" offset="14303766">No one has ever claimed that the Department of Justice unduly delayed before June of '72 when it received the C.I.D's report of its reinvestigation of the crimes, and its decision with regard to Grand Jury was made in the Summer of '74 and respondent was indicted in January of 1975 so essentially talking about two or two-and-half year period, now during that two or two-and-a-half years there were two prevailing views within the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.395" offset="14397493">One group of Attorneys thought that the case should be brought to a Grand Jury immediately with the view towards bringing charges against respondent.</text>
