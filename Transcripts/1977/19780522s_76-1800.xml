            <text syncTime="11.232" offset="124815">This case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.315" offset="145191">The question here is whether a corporate officer's liability to the Government for taxes with help from corporate employees is dischargable in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.060" offset="196182">The Internal Revenue Service filed a bankruptcy claim for taxes that respondent had collected from his corporation's employees, but had not paid over to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.099" offset="244351">The Bankruptcy Court held that, respondent was liable for these taxes under the Internal Revenue Code and that this liability was made non-dischargeable by the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.490" offset="289909">The District Court affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.765" offset="311016">It did so largely on the ground that respondent's liability is termed a penalty by the Internal Revenue Code whereas the Bankruptcy Act's non-dischargeability provision refers to taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.839" offset="371307">By an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.529" offset="394085">The penalty language of the court is not dispositive because of funds were unquestionably taxes when collected from the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.413" offset="437553">Congress was particularly concerned about situations in which corporations and their officer's would be relieved the liability in bankruptcy, while unincorporated small businessman will remain liable for the same type of debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.264" offset="504949">Thus both the statutory language and the legislative history support our holding that respondent's liability is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.966" offset="551760">Mr. Justice Rehnquist is probably dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Stevens joined.</text>
