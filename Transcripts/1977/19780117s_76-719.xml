            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="15.436" offset="141630">This case involves Section 8F of National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.798" offset="163155">The provision which permits employers and unions in the construction industry to enter in their so called pre-hire agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.599" offset="202339">Setting wages and hours and working conditions, even though union does not then represent a majority of the employees that might be working on later projects, that the employer undertakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.767" offset="263047">The section however permits the union, or the employer or the employees to seek an election at any time after the signing of pre-hire agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.385" offset="305470">And the union must then demonstrate its majority status, if it is to purport to represent all of the employees in the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.807" offset="351132">This case arises because of the National Labor Relations Board's rule, that the union's majority status is also up for challenging and fairly reflected its proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.672" offset="406616">Here the union picketed the employer claiming that the employer was in violation of his pre-hire agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.899" offset="435560">The employer responded by filing a charge with the board claiming that the picketing was recognitional picketing contrary to section 87.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.772" offset="486969">The board held that, that because the union had not demonstrated its majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.438" offset="513718">Indeed it was stipulated that it had no majority at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.099" offset="532317">That the union was not entitled to picket, to enforce a contract in the manner that a collective bargaining agent could do and the board went on to hold that the picketing was recognitional and in violation of 87.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.144" offset="604520">Court of Appeals reversed, the Court held essentially that although the union's standing was challengable in an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.135" offset="648510">It was not a challengable and unfair labor practice proceedings and the union thus here was simply picketing to enforce a contract as it was entitled to do according to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.963" offset="711831">We reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the reasons that will appear in the opinion we have filed, we agree essentially with the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.531" offset="754045">We think their construction, application of the act is reasonable of one even if not the only one that might be acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.420" offset="789571">So we reverse the judgment of Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.374" offset="801379">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed the dissenting opinion and he has joined by Justices Blackmun and Stevens.</text>
