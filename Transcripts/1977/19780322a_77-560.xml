            <label>Mr. Robert N. Hackett</label>
            <text syncTime="80.380" offset="401512">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please enter the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.951" offset="419798">The argument of the petitioner Joan Evans Gardner will be presented first with a little statement of the facts, then I would like to discuss the legal issue of the heart of the relief sought in the case and I would like to discuss the unconditional denial of the class and I would like to discuss the rationale that the Courts have used in interpreting section 1292(a)(1) as a means of appealing a denial of injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.253" offset="556993">Then, I would like look at the logic of the cases under 1292(a)(1) starting with the early cases in the 30s and finally finishing with Switzerland Cheese case in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.041" offset="620105">Then I would like to discuss the issue of a permanent versus a preliminary injunction and then I would like to discuss the strong policy to allow civil right Class Actions and finally, the general floodgate argument that has been proposed by the respondent concerning the floodgate of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.384" offset="717489">Joan Evans Gardner filed this case in May 29, 1975 seeking a wide Class Action under Rule 23(b)(2) seeking as a heart of relief, injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.742" offset="782900">The scope of the class is set forth in pages 8a to 11a of the Appendix and the injunctive is set forth in complaint that it was requested in pages 13a to 14a.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.940" offset="843713">We moved within 90 days as required by the local rule for a class determination, we filed class interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.416" offset="877568">On February 3rd, 1976, the lower court denied the Class Action stating that Ms. Gardner was an inadequate representative of the class under 23(a)(4) because she sought a job that some other woman might want and therefore she was antagonistic to the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.037" offset="968056">This was an unconditional order.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.892" offset="983520">Then, we appealed that decision as a matter of right under 1292(a)(1) as a denial of our injunctive relief because it narrowed the scope of the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.655" offset="1026570">The Third Circuit dismissed with no jurisdiction saying that 1292(a)(1) did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.420" offset="1069620">First, I think it is obvious the injunctive relief under b2 is the heart of the relief sought in a wide civil rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.882" offset="1115491">We sought an across the board Class Action as has been sanctioned by the Fifth Circuit in Long vs.Seth and the denial of the broad injunctive relief has been recognized by four circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.380" offset="1161466">The first circuit doing so was the Fourth in about 1962 under Brunson vs. Board of Trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.434" offset="1185708">The First, Fifth, and Ninth circuits have all agreed with that under Yaffe vs. Powers, Jones vs. Diamond and Price vs. Lucky Stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.052" offset="1232101">Further, the determination by Judge McCune that it was an unconditional denial, was a matter of law and contained no possibility except within his scope of being reversed because if she is antagonistic to the class, she is going to stay antagonistic to the class Thus as Justice Stewart said in United Airlines vs. McDonald, the action was stripped of its character as the Class Action.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.977" offset="1395837">I do not believe we could persuade Judge McCune to change his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.775" offset="1419034">We could have tried but, we felt first of all that we had a right of appeal because of the four circuits cases and only at that time one or two against us and secondly, it has been our experience in the Western District Court that it is simply too unsure and heavy a burden to try to get Class Action denials changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.611" offset="1506387">I guess that was a policy decision on my part.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.190" offset="1532719">The unconditional denial doctrine was recognized in Yaffe vs. Powers when they said the broad injunctive relief was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.195" offset="1576709">I now like to move to general rationale of what the courts have used to interpret 1292(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="382.655" offset="1610564">The buzz words that the courts has used since General Electric vs. Marvel Rare Products till Switzerland Cheese has not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.911" offset="1643582">That is, if the substantial effect of the order is to deny an injunction then they have considered that rationale as what they will look at.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.121" offset="1816408">Arguably it does, but they are free right there to institute their own suit and they know about it and there no problem then instituting the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.852" offset="1851308">I think that is a little different fact situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.467" offset="1861861">I think the Class Action situation is more like General Electric vs. Marvel Rare Products where a counter claim asked for the injunction and the counter claim was denied and they held it was a denial of an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.591" offset="1922361">The courts all the way though General Electric and Switzerland Cheese have said that the substantial effect doctrine will apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.753" offset="1966978">Now let us look what the results were of the 1291 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.564" offset="1982234">I submit that if you follow the logic of looking, if the decision effects the ultimate relief sought, then it should be appealable under 1292(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="487.268" offset="2029045">Now, for example, if you are just delaying the decision in Switzerland Cheese, where you failed to grant a summary judgment and then you leave the equitable relief possibility open to the end, because there is an issue effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.574" offset="2098217">You are not affecting the ultimate relief that you could get, you are only delaying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.103" offset="2116399">Again, in Baltimore Contractors, if you are simply refusing to stay in accounting, an accounting does not give you the ultimate relief and accounting is only a means used to show if something is owed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.116" offset="2172405">But in a Class Action, you are drastically reducing the scope of the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.250" offset="2208977">As Justice Stevens said in his dissent in (Inaudible), you must have the Class Action in order to get the wide injunctive relief or it would be unfair to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.132" offset="2252444">In this Court, Justice Stewart in the Teamsters v. US case, and Justice Brennan in Franks v. Bowman, set forth the burden of proof in Class Action cases and the injunctive granted in the Class Action sets the perimeters for that burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.829" offset="2331230">So that you have a completely different of proof in Class Action cases and in the scope of the reliefs than you do in the McDonald Douglas v. Green case which was the individual opinion by Justice Powell.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.050" offset="2384101">But if had I joined two or three claims in a suit against the defendant and the judge terminates my case with respect to two of my claims and have permanently reduced the kind of a judgment that I can get, I still can appeal unless he cooperates with me.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.177" offset="2596634">It has to be a denial of a relief that is equitable in nature and injunctive in nature and not just the a change in money.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.184" offset="4016650">I would like the Court to look at the strong public policy that was announced in this Court in Albamaro case by Mr. Justice Stewart, citing the 1972 amendments to Title 7 and saying that those amendments were not to do anything that would discourage private Class Actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.737" offset="4102854">It is important to realize that the Class Action tool is the catalyst tool to enforce Title 7 by plaintiffs and this Court in looking at the Class Action in almost all of their decision in Franks v. Bowman, Albamaro and in Teamsters v. US has recognized that strong public policy not to deteriorate use of the Class Action device, and I think, one of the reason that should not deteriorate the use of the class Action is one of the very purposes of Rule 23 was to prevent from multiplicity of suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.705" offset="4246737">That is that if you are suing a corporation and you are asking a broad injunctive relief on wide basis there is then no need to have individual suits and this particular use of the device is exactly what is meant to be used in Title 7 and the decisions of this Court in Title 7 have really focused on stating the vast difference in the burden of proof and the vast differences in the presumptions that are available to class plaintiffs when a decision has been made on the stage one or liability proceeding of Class Actions in Title 7,Now the answer -- the first 10 pages of the respondent?s argument and the questions that came from this Court in the previous argument focused a good deal on the floodgate problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.220" offset="4816833">If we look at the Fourth Circuit from 1966 to 1977, we see that they had an average increase of 21.14% but in D C circuit which never had the doctrine and still does not have it because Williams v.

            <text syncTime="1218.631" offset="4954446">I do not believe so it is important to realize that we are only talking about roughly 6% of all appeals in the civil rights area and that there is no indication that the decisions of the Ninth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Fourth Circuits and the First Circuit have increased the appeals percentage wise when they switched to this doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.331" offset="5057264">Some of them go down, therefore, I think the floodgate of appeal argument is not only factually wrong but also I believe that Mr. Justice Burger in US v. Abne(ph) indicated that under 1291 and under the whole court?s philosophy in looking at appeals that whether you have to do in essence more work does not make a legal reason not to have an appeal if as a matter of right you have it under 1292(a)(1) or under any statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.222" offset="5192787">The philosophy has always been, we give the practical and non-technical approach and I do not think it is a legal argument to argue that an increase in load is a legal reason for refusing the appeal and in closing of course, I would like to say that in any event, the floodgate statistics presented in the respondent?s brief are not well founded and I believe an analysis of the administrative court will show that they are not correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.285" offset="5361120">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.077" offset="5376271">This case presents the narrow question as to whether the denial of class certification in a lawsuit seeking permanent but not preliminary injunctive relief is immediately appealable as of right under 28 US code 1292(a)(1) as an interlocutory order refusing an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.116" offset="5468431">It is undisputed that Congress in adopting 1292 intended a very limited exception to the final judgment rule embodied in 1291 which since the first Judiciary Act has been the dominant rule of appellate practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.688" offset="5542724">Congress has determined that with respect to certain specific categories of interlocutory orders set forth in sub section A, an immediate appeal should be allowed as of right and is also provided for discretionary appellate review of other interlocutory orders under 1292b provided the conditions set forth in that sub section are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.112" offset="5652438">This Court has recognized in a number of decisions that appeal rights cannot depend upon the facts of a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.541" offset="5686084">Congress has necessarily had to draw the jurisdictional statutes in terms of categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.519" offset="5718057">Thus the issue in any given case including this one is whether the particular order appealed from fits within the category of appeals allowed by Congress or whether the appeal is not permissible in the light of the principles and the history concerning appellate jurisdiction and in particular, the longstanding congressional policy against piecemeal appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.813" offset="5823174">Section 1292 does not expressly provide a right of appeal with respect to orders either granting or denying Class Action status.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.221" offset="7560839">That is her argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.926" offset="7567631">The contention is without merit for a number of reasons.Section 1292(a)(1) is clearly as I have indicated intended to provide interlocutory appellate review only for those orders which directly and immediately either grant or refuse injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.457" offset="7641819">Congress recognized that unless an immediate appeal were permitted that there could be no effective review of an order for example, granting or refusing a preliminary injunction and that to delay review until after a final decision on the merits would be the practical equivalent of no review at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.287" offset="7725097">It would be impossible to review the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction after the case had proceeded to a merits determinations and the Court had made a decision so consequently, it adopted 1292(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.205" offset="7788732">The order Ms. Gardner appealed from here does not posses this characteristic which is essential to a right of appeal under 1292 (a) (1).</text>

            <text syncTime="2391.731" offset="9646874">A rule of appealability based upon the eventual effect of an order has of course no easily definable limit and would provide the plaintiffs with more than one opportunity to obtain piecemeal review of a wide variety of interlocutory orders and which would mean that the final judgment rule would eventually be swallowed up by what Congress intended to be a narrow exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.810" offset="9747184">Moreover, such a rule of appealability, we believe is clearly inconsistent with Justice Rehnquist?s decision in Wetzel which showed that an order granting judgment on the merits for the plaintiff without ruling on the request for injunctive relief was not appealable by the defendants under 1292(a)(1) despite its inherent effect on the ultimate availability of injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.881" offset="9843419">A rule of appealability such as that advocated by Ms. Gardner would further burden the appellate courts with a task of determining in each case the jurisdictional question of whether the order appealed from, had the effect of granting or denying an injunction and it would have to do so on the basis of a record which might well be inadequate for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.154" offset="9940595">Now Ms. Gardner also argues that the 1292(a)(1) should be extended to interlocutor orders denying class status because immediate review might avoid an unnecessary trial and expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.689" offset="9994720">It would have done the same thing in Baltimore Contractors as Mr. Justice Black mentioned in his dissent but that consideration really is not to remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.503" offset="10037979">It is the function of Congress to determine whether the time and expense that might be say, by permitting interlocutory appeals sufficiently out weighs the impact of the effect of permitting those appeals on the docket of the Appellate Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.970" offset="10131811">This Court has repeatedly said that it is not authorized to approve or declare judicial modification of the jurisdictional statutes regardless of the importance of the issue or other considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.179" offset="10352702">Yes, you are right but of course the ultimate impact if you adopted their argument, they could have said that the effect of that order granting liability was to effectively grant an injunction even though, the only thing that was left to be done by Judge Webber was to issue the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.059" offset="10452177">That is what we mean by the statement, so if you followed an effective standard, you would have permitted an appeal in Wetzel we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.162" offset="10500555">Now for those reasons, we believe that the Third Circuit was clearly correct in its conclusion that Ms. Gardner?s theory of appealability would represent an unwarranted expansion of 1292(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.174" offset="10564608">Now I would like to go to the second point that we would argue and that is even if the effective denial of an injunction standard is a correct standard under 1292(a)(1), that standard has no application here because the denial of class certification cannot constitute the effective denial of an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.030" offset="10656036">We say that for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.011" offset="10663977">First, because the order was tentative and provisional under Rule 23c1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.102" offset="10696369">It could be altered at any time. Secondly, because it is by no means clear what relief if any Ms. Gardner could get in her lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.512" offset="10746002">That fact would not be known until after a final hearing on the merits and to ask an Appellate Court on a 1292(a)(1) appeal to speculate as to what relief she might able to get if she proves her case on the basis of an inadequate record, I think is an unworkable standard and places an impossible burden on the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.369" offset="10853417">The plain fact of the matter is that that will not be known until she puts in her proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.932" offset="10875674">Now third, of course is the fact that at any time there could be intervention by other persons in the putative class and if those persons appeal then the scope of the relief might be different than if she proceeds with an individual action or it might not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.372" offset="10965430">But again that is something that will occur at some time in the future but the fact of the matter is that intervention by other people, in this lawsuit might make a difference with respect to the injunctive relief that might ultimately be attained and obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.466" offset="11041813">So for all three of those reasons, we say that the denial of class certification cannot possibly constitute the effective denial of an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.524" offset="11086012">Now Ms. Gardner makes a point in her brief that if she has not permitted to appeal now, that it is likely that this case will never be appealed and she says that for two reasons. She says first, if I lose on the merits, I have no right to appeal the adverse class determination under Rodriguez and she says if I win on the my individual case, I will have no incentive to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.102" offset="11228327">Now the first is incorrect as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.030" offset="11240030">The second is purely speculative irrelevant at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.445" offset="11261764">First Rodriguez as we read it says nothing about her right to appeal the adverse class determination after final judgment if she loses her case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.892" offset="11303559">United Airlines says that.</text>
