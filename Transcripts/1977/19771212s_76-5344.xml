            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.004" offset="115927">The petitioner in this case was convicted in an Illinois state court of rape and related offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.008" offset="148006">At his trial the complaining witness testified on direct examination by the prosecution that at a preliminary hearing, she had identified petitioner as a man who had attacked her.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.838" offset="207252">Petitioner was not represented by counsel when this identification was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.989" offset="227836">After exhausting the state remedies, petitioner sought relief by Habeas Corpus in a Federal District court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.032" offset="260019">He argued first that he should have been represented by counsel when the complaining witness identified him at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.329" offset="297217">He further contended that the state's testimony at trial as to his prior un-counseled identification violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.219" offset="348835">The District Court denied the writ, and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.571" offset="374226">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.170" offset="384571">The preliminary hearing at which the identification took place occurred after the initiation of adversary additional criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.240" offset="428874">Under the cases of this court petitioner therefore was entitled to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.881" offset="459490">In Gilbert against California the Court also made clear that it is reversible error for the prosecution to elicit testimony at trial a better prior identification made as in this case in circumstances where there was a denial of the constitutional right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.010" offset="551963">We therefore reverse and remand the case to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.028" offset="572025">That court will be free however, to determine whether the error in admitting this testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.558" offset="614135">Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have filed a concurring opinions, Mr. Justice Stevens did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
