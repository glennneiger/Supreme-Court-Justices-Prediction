            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79988">In United States against New Mexico, the second of the two opinions which I am announcing, deals with the proper application of a so called "implied-reservation-of-water doctrine."</text>
            <text syncTime="10.906" offset="123560">The Rio Mimbres which furnishes needed water to portions of South-West in Mexico rises in the Gila National Forest near Silver City in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.582" offset="166297">As part of a general stream adjudication, the New Mexico state District Court held that the United States had no reserved right to the use of any water in the Gila National Forest for recreation, aesthetics, wildlife preservation or cattle grazing, although it did have for other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.873" offset="239439">The United States appealed and the Supreme Court of New Mexico affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.512" offset="257934">In an opinion filed today with the clerk of the Court, we in turn affirm the Supreme Court of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.312" offset="281235">Although Congress has never expressly reserved any water for use in the Gila National Forest, the Court has previously held that when the President in accordance with the an act of Congress reserved lands from the public domain, there is impliedly reserved any unappropriated and pertinent water, that is necessary to accomplish the purpose of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.813" offset="363155">The implied reservation doctrine however extends only to the amount of water necessary to fulfill the purpose of the reservation, no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.032" offset="400040">Examination of the Organic Administration Act of 1897 which setup our system of national forests, demonstrates that Congress did not intended to reserve water in the Gila National Forest for aesthetic, recreational, wildlife preservation or stockwatering purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.368" offset="469421">Not only are the purposes of national forests limited in the Act of timber preservation, watershed improvement, but in emphasizing the importance of watershed improvement, Congress evidenced it's concern that as much water as possible reach private state appropriators.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.701" offset="534728">We conclude that in passing the Multiple-Use, Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, Congress did not intend to reserve additional water for use on forest lands previously withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.988" offset="583838">Mr. Justice Powell, joined by Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Marshall has filed an opinion dissenting in part in this case.</text>
