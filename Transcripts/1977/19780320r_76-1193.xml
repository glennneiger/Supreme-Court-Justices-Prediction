            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="29.385" offset="197440">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.796" offset="211128">This case is here on writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit holding that respondent's grand jury testimony was properly suppressed in the exercise of that court’s supervisory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.973" offset="271836">This case arose when respondent was called to appear before a special organized crime grand jury in the eastern district of New York investigating extortion at debt collection activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.785" offset="315095">The grand jury was being conducted by a Strike Force attorney from Washington who had been specially assigned by the Assistant Attorney General for the purpose of conducting the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.953" offset="355742">The government had evidence that respondent while employed as a skip tracer by Frankie Provenzano had other threats against the life of a gambling debtor to that debtor’s bother.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.179" offset="404643">When respondent appeared before the grand jury, she was given a careful explanation of her right not to answer potentially self-incriminating questions and of her right to the assistance of counsel who could be available to her outside the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.880" offset="463471">She was also told about the perjury laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.996" offset="475905">She was not told that she was a target of the investigation and during the interrogation she was not told that the government possessed evidence directly contradicting her testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.061" offset="524179">In the course of her testimony she flatly denied the conversation involving the threats to the debtor’s brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.226" offset="556884">The grand jury indicted respondent both of the substantive offense of transmitting a threat and for perjury in denying the existence of the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.966" offset="595755">The district court suppressed respondent’s grand jury testimony on ground subsequently invalidated by this Court in United States against Mandujano when United States against Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.894" offset="643506">The Court of Appeal upheld the district court’s action not on the constitutional ground, but on the basis of its supervisory powers that exercised these powers in response not to any violation of Mrs. Jacobs’ right, but to the irregularity perceived in the failure of the Strike Force Attorney to follow what the court understood to be the uniform practice of the US Attorney’s Office in that district than in the Circuit generally to advise perspective defendants of their status as grand jury targets when they were called to appear before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.823" offset="783209">The Court of Appeals stated that the exclusion of evidence in this case was a one time sanction which it said it was imposing for didactic purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.699" offset="822706">I might say parenthetically that the lesson it meant to teach the government is not altogether clear to us from its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.262" offset="853009">It explicitly disallows any intent to require of giving of target warnings and while it speaks broadly of some points of uniformity in prosecutorial practice and making equal justice available to all, both commendable goals in which we whole heartedly concur, rather points, its opinion seem quite explicitly to limit its concern to uniformity within a single district and even more specifically to conformity of Strike Force practice to the practice of the United States Attorney's Office.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="288.219" offset="1232829">Well, there are other intimations of broader principles of uniformity in prosecutorial practice generally, so that I am not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.986" offset="1275879">I assume at a minimum we can distill the lesson that the Strike Force Attorneys ought to follow the practice of the US Attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.868" offset="1319451">Now, whatever the lesson was that they meant to teach the questions that this Court must decide or essentially too, the first is whether the Federal Courts possess as part of their supervisory powers, the power to exclude evidence as a remedy for pre-trial prosecutorial conduct that the court finds distasteful, but that does not violate the defendant’s constitutional or statutory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.299" offset="1417149">The second is assuming that such power exists and at least in some cases was it appropriately exercised?</text>
            <text syncTime="340.167" offset="1440659">In this case, we submit that the proper answer to both questions is no and we have advanced several arguments in our brief, any one of which if expect that would compel reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.285" offset="1513071">Before turning to the arguments, I want to inform the Court of a recent development that has at least background interest for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.868" offset="1543373">On December 16th 1977, the Department of Justice issued significant amendments to the United States Attorney’s Manual on the subject of grand jury practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.131" offset="1584437">Under these procedures, grand jury witnesses are now receiving with the subpoena a printed advice of rights form which briefly states the nature of the grand jury’s inquiry and advises them of their self incrimination and counsel rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.191" offset="1640757">The content of this advice is essentially what was told to Mrs. Jacobs when she was in the grand jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.295" offset="1669074">In addition, the new internal guidelines direct the targets of the grand jury’s inquiry be advised that their conduct is being investigated for possible violation of Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.355" offset="1709407">A target is defined in the new manual provision as “a person as to whom the prosecutor has substantial evidence linking him to the commission of a crime and who in the judgment of the prosecutor’s appear to be defendant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="422.559" offset="1770220">These new manual provisions represent an effort by the department to achieve greater uniformity of prosecutorial practice in the conduct of grand juries, the same goal that the Court of Appeal sought to foster by suppressing respondent’s testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.840" offset="1827271">Now, the fact that the department has instituted these procedures makes this case if anything more important than before in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.013" offset="1859977">If the judicial supervisory power is held to extent to suppression of evidence related to prosecutorial departure from uniform practice, there will be a new category of suppression hearings to which criminal defendants will be entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.454" offset="1913789">In addition to Miranda claims, Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule claims, Wade Stover claims and alike, the courts will have to entertain Jacob’s suppression motions based upon allegations that internal guidelines related to prosecutorial practices were that consistent, informal prosecutorial practices have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.186" offset="2000724">These inquires will not always be easy since there are numerable areas of prosecutorial activities in which standard practices have developed informally or are called for by the United States Attorney’s manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.498" offset="2049939">Looking just at the aspect involved in this case the concept of a grand jury target is a slippery one, specially in the context of an investigatory grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.665" offset="2090586">Often a witness in Mandujano or Wang or Mrs. Jacobs are all examples, would be someone who could be indicted, but who the grand jury is really more interested in as a source of information leading to higher ups.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.996" offset="2151921">In other words, there will be run for considerable controversy in interpreting these prosecutorial guidelines and the Courts will be shouldering a significant added burden in undertaking to supervise prosecutorial conduct by determining --</text>

            <text syncTime="606.272" offset="2504992">I think it will be futile feel for further litigation, but I do want to say that wholly apart from considerations of increased judicial workload that would result from adding Jacob’s type suppression motions, there is a serious of the legitimacy and of the efficacy of judicial efforts to enforce non-statutory and non-constitutional standards of prosecutorial conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.812" offset="2611154">Inherent in the voluntary adoption by the executive branch of such practices is the expectation that the interpretation and the enforcement of these practices will be for the executive branch.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.143" offset="2916473">I do not think it should be taking that step at all and in this connection, I refer to your statement on Court of Appeals in the Newman case which dealt with the question of the legitimacy of judicial inquiry into whether prosecutors have conformed to their own standards of behavior.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.601" offset="3782380">At the time that this took place that what we were dealing with was a purely informal practice within the US Attorney’s districts and there was no provision in the manual requiring the giving of target warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.700" offset="3834729">Indeed the Court of Appeals when it made its inquiry the first time the appeal was before it is the wrong question because they asked what the practice was at the time they were hearing the first appeal and they did not even ask whether at the time Mrs. Jacobs testified there was any practice in the Eastern District to give target warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.165" offset="3912574">In any event, let me try -- in my first argument I focused largely on the point that even assuming that there is some supervisory power in this area, it was improperly exercised by the Court of Appeals in the circumstances of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="993.008" offset="4051964">I will begin with Rule 402 of the Federal rules of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.190" offset="4068682">I think it is undisputed by anyone that the supervisory power of the courts is subject to statutory restriction and we submit that Rule 402 does eliminate whatever power the Courts previously enjoyed to apply the remedy of evidentiary suppression except in the circumstances specified by the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.490" offset="4141929">Now, the rule begins by saying all relevant evidence is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.920" offset="4163663">If it is what all it said the Court of Appeals might have been correct in concluding that the rule was not designed to and did not circumscribe pre-existing inherent supervisory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.325" offset="4209221">However, the rule says more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.643" offset="4218520">It explicitly delineates the exceptions to the general requirement of admissibility that the courts are empowered to recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.698" offset="4246733">The rule is set forth it several places in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.574" offset="4258226">I am looking at page 14 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.415" offset="4269616">It says all relevant evidence is admissible except as otherwise provided by the constitution of the United States by act of Congress by these rules that is the rules of evidence or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.884" offset="4339520">Moreover the adoption of Rule 402 was accompanied by an amendment to Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which eliminated the provision which had been relied on in Alkins for example as conferring upon the Courts a general, in a sense common law power to formulate rules of evidence under their inherent supervisory powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.883" offset="4607431">We are not calling into question in anyway the power of the Federal Courts to apply the remedy of evidentiary exclusion, when that remedy is necessary to protect constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.121" offset="4668453">The more difficult question is when we come to violations of statutory rights or of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.154" offset="4700532">Now, it is clear from the rule that if a statute or a rule listed in Rule 402 explicitly provides a remedy of evidentiary exclusion, of course that remedy may be enforced by the courts, agreeably to Rule 402 and an example of that is the wiretap statute which contains various exclusionary principles, some of which are not constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.213" offset="4788826">But if the statute or rule does not specify exclusion of evidences or remedy then there is a close issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.506" offset="4814008">The rule on its face would appear to foreclose exclusion in such circumstances since admissibility must according to the language be provided by the constitution statue or rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.186" offset="4860715">But in any event whether the court has the power in enforcing a statutory rule listed in Rule 402 to exclude evidence ancillary to that the finding of a violation, there is no way it seems to us that its power under Rule 402 continues, if it ever did to reach out where there is no constitutional violation, no statute over --</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.856" offset="6615412">Mr. Frey, I assume you can draw a line between out of court and in court, the way you put to grand jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.001" offset="6655954">Well, let me pass on to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.804" offset="6663164">I have very little time left, so I just want to say, I think the McNabb and Alkin cases are different from the Allen charge cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.013" offset="6699944">They come closer, but the point I want to make about those was that the Court has never exercised its supervisory power without finding a violation of the defendants' rights in the McNabb-Alkin kind of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.744" offset="6746964">Now, let me respond to your point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.759" offset="6758981">The grand jury is in significant respects a norm of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.225" offset="6772878">Federal Courts have legitimate and substantial interest in over seeing grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.895" offset="6795552">Now, we think they have to be circumspect about keeping a line between what is intruding on executive branch functions and what is proper judicial functions, but it is not necessary to our argument today to say that the courts do not have supervisory power to promulgate a rule to give target warnings in the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.348" offset="6869322">In other words, we can concede that the Courts could adopt such a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.083" offset="6888235">They could say henceforth you will record all proceedings before a grand jury transcriber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.378" offset="6909446">Henceforth you will give certain warnings to witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.839" offset="6923343">Henceforth you will not call targets, but these are prospect of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.414" offset="6949570">They are not a retrospective reaching out on a selective ad hoc basis to pick a single past instance of a practice which the Court had never indicated before was inappropriate and imposing a sanction of suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.884" offset="7011428">The question Mr. Justice Marshal is remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.416" offset="7021564">It is not the power to make the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.638" offset="7030445">It is the power to impose the particular remedy which the court selected in this case of suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.131" offset="7052493">And I might say that we are dealing here with standards of conduct for prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.822" offset="7071196">In Mapp against Ohio the Court found itself confronted with a policeman over whom it had very little power with respect to whom it had very little ability to discipline him and it was in a sense compelled, if it was going to anything about what it viewed as a rash of otherwise uncontrollable Fourth Amendment violations to use a remedy of evidentiary exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.277" offset="7161057">Here we are dealing with prosecutors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.138" offset="8332493">I do not believe this case involves an instance where the Appellate Court seeks to direct the prosecutor in what he must or must not say and I believe the underlying opinion of the Court of Appeals expressly states that if the prosecutor wishes or the Attorney General wished, they need not us the law has presently constituted, give any type of target warning and as time has indicated the Attorney General of the Unites States has deemed it appropriate to adopt the requirement of target warnings as a uniform practice outside the scope of Constitutional and statutory requirement in the United States of America, effective I believe February the 15th, 1978 or there about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.988" offset="8551921">I believe what the Court of Appeals was concerned about and what I was initially concerned about as defense counsel in this matter who brings approximately ten years as a prosecutor as a background to this type of case was a conduct that would be taking place before an arm of the Court, to a Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.107" offset="8640320">I submit to the Court that this is not an issue of an Appellate Court seeking to exercise its chancellor’s veto of executive branch practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.201" offset="8708760">I submit to the Court that since the Court’s constitutional rulings in Mandujano and its progeny that absent the exercise of supervisory power over Grand Jury’s by Appellate and District Court, this is Court has left bare the protection and the requirement inherent in the exercise of equal and fair justice, any concept of protection to any witness who appears before the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.200" offset="8840731">For the Court has clearly stated that there is no requirement for Miranda warning, target warnings of any type in that type of setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2722.870" offset="10971382">However, the analogy of the Allen charge under diversity of practice within the circuit and the fact that, that does exist and the fact that this Court has not chosen to apply a uniform standard or universal standard here in the United States, if anything buttresses my position that the Second Circuit with respect to its jurisdiction could certainly adopt a procedure or a concept of what should take place before its grand juries that have reasonableness and nobody has contended that the suggestion that the requirement of a target warning be given is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.294" offset="11145149">And if anything, the fact that the US, the Attorney General has adopted that practice adds weight to the significance of this case and the requirement in acknowledging the existence of the supervisory power of the circuit court when reasonably exercised and in this case adoption by the Attorney General which shows some type of reasonableness as to the concept that the supervisory power is what is at issue here and not whether or not my client who faces prosecution on another aspect of this charge has or has not committed perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.982" offset="11323826">I do not stand before this Court to condone perjury and that has never been my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.663" offset="11346605">However, I do not believe when the circuit court stated that this Court has adopted a rule, a principle of law that in any perjury indictment that per se there is no concept of suppression or the sanction of suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.866" offset="11415360">And as a matter of fact even in the Mandujano case which was a plurality opinion, I believe that there was an acknowledgment that there might be some situations in which even given a perjury that the sanction of suppression would be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.272" offset="11505012">I might add that there has not been a trial in this matter and all that the indictment really is hopefully is an allegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.942" offset="11563735">The posture of this case as to the consideration of the point of law or principle of law involved herein is what took place before that grand jury and whether or not the circuit or the district court could apply its supervisory power, which obviously was not arbitrary or capricious, given the adoption of the same principle of law by the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.780" offset="11683062">And what is at issue here, is can this Court or should this Court, in essence, interfere with the reasoned judgment of a circuit court that had previously warned prosecutors that given Strike Force's failure to adhere to certain standards that it was giving them fair warning that the next time it would apply sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.368" offset="11829453">I might add that if this Court interferes with the supervisory application, a circuit court power then it would be adopting the suggestion of Mr. Frey which I believe this Court could not reasonably entertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.677" offset="11906671">There is no way that a circuit court nor the defense counsel can supervise each and every prosecutor as to what he or she does, just as it would be impossible to this court to supervise each and every judge within its jurisdiction as to what he or she does, and therefore, the essence of the supervisory power is to permit the Court to guide in general terms, the conduct of those who are responsible and the performance of their duties within its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.734" offset="12090886">In this instance, the jurisdiction is not the executive branch of government. The jurisdiction is a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.686" offset="12122651">There is no argument and case law and statute is clear that the grand jury is a norm of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.601" offset="12154311">That means that it is created by the court, it is supervised by the court, the grand jury reports back to the court and if need be, the prosecutor can be excluded from appearing before that arm of the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.988" offset="12639875">And I submit to the Court that in this instance the sanction that was imposed here which results in the dismissal of the perjury indictment related not to the perjury, not to the perjury count, but rather to the conduct of the prosecutor in failing to adhere to a prior written formal warning to Strike Force Attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.856" offset="12759412">I would hope that the Court would not per move from circuit courts, its wisdom in determining when it should apply sanctions of this type.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.836" offset="13695327">In closing, I submit to the Court that the suggestion by Mr. Frey that the failure of the prosecutor in this case to adhere to internal guide of lines is not the sole and total issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.034" offset="13820088">The question really is whether or not the Second Circuit can from the standpoint of fairness and the expectation of equal treatment by its citizens require that once government has chosen a line of approach that singular or particular prosecutors not have their own personal predilections apply with respect to the application of that particular principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.298" offset="13973165">And as Judge Friendly stated in the Estepa (Ph) case which again was recognition of the court's supervisory power also involving a perjury case that he stated “we had hoped that with the clear warning we have given to prosecutors and the assurances given by United States Attorneys a reversal for him, properly use a fair say before the grand jury would not be required.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.187" offset="14096672">Here the Assistant United States Attorney whether willingly or unwillingly, we prefer to think the latter, clearly violated the first of these provisos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.732" offset="14138886">We cannot, with proper respect for the discharge of our duties, content ourselves with yet another admonition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.902" offset="14171591">A reversal, with the instructions to dismiss the indictment, may help to translate the assurances of the United States Attorneys into the consistent performance by their assistance.
