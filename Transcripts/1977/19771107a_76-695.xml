            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80000">We will hear argument first this morning in 76-695, University of Missouri, Board of Curators against Horowitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.293" offset="149172">Mr. Wright, you may proceed whenever you ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="20.711" offset="162756">Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.151" offset="176549">I am Marvin Wright, attorney representing the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.453" offset="193789">The petitioners are the University of Missouri, the Governing Board of that Institution, provost for health sciences on the campus of the University located in Kansas City and the Dean of the School of Medicine located on the campus of University of Missouri at Kansas city.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.593" offset="262335">Respondent is Miss. Charlotte Horowitz who was a student in that Medical School, until her dismissal for deficient academic performance in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.518" offset="309982">Now, the issue, primary issue before the Court today is that of whether or not a medical student in a public institution of higher education is entitled to a notice of charges and a hearing prior to dismissal from that school for deficient academic performance, its second issue is that of whether or not, when a medical student has prior knowledge of deficient academic performance, the reasons are not disclosed and made public, whether or not that student has a stigma imposed upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.723" offset="470792">Under the preview of the Fourteenth Amendment, when a formal hearing is not held.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.322" offset="497228">The last issue naturally is that of whether or not the procedures which were utilized by the University of Missouri were fair to the student and complied with any requirements of the procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.602" offset="550309">Now the facts just very briefly of the case are this.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.122" offset="564415">The school was established in 1971, the Governing Board adopted a document entitled an Academic Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.276" offset="605061">Now for purposes of the case today, this academic plan established or is called a council on evaluation, which is a committee charged with responsibility of reviewing the academic performance of students and then making appropriate recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.125" offset="680398">There is a second committee which is referred to as a coordinating committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.785" offset="699102">Responsibility of this committee, is to review recommendations coming out of the first mentioned committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.751" offset="730971">This latter committee makes recommendations to the Dean of the School and the Dean makes final decisions with respect to student dismissals.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.300" offset="773185">Now, the rules and regulations of the institution is set forth in this academic plan, do not extend to the student, the right to appear before either of these committees or the Dean, when the question is that of an evaluation of academic performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.091" offset="840268">The same documents sets forth the fact that graduating requirements of the institution and the primary goal naturally is that of graduating confident and safe physicians, those that are qualified not only in basic medical science knowledge, but also qualified in the sense of clinical competency.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="211.377" offset="925427">If the University provided for automatic dismissal or termination on failure for two successive years to maintain an average of 70, let us say, will they need a hearing if developed that for two years the average was 60?</text>

            <label>Mr. Marvin E. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="228.613" offset="994390">No Your Honor, I did not believe that it would, any more than in the case at Bar because it boils to a question of the academic evaluation being placed upon the professors of the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.033" offset="1060114">It is for this reason the professors have given the evaluation of 60 in your example, the School has set forth requirement of an average as seventy.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="254.335" offset="1097313">In other words you are saying that, when the judgment is subjective by a committee, it is not any different from, on a mathematical evaluation.</text>

          <turn speaker="marvin_e_wright" startTime="266.928" stopTime="332.326">
            <label>Mr. Marvin E. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="266.928" offset="1147677">Well, that is correct Your Honor because the subjective evaluation of the professors, the institution University of Missouri of Kansas City, a numerical figure is not placed upon a student's performance, but obviously in placing a sixty on the student performance, the subjective judgment of the professor is what leads to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.881" offset="1247464">Now the respondent in this case Charlotte Horowitz, the University has never raised any question concerning this individual's intellectual ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.527" offset="1298038">She came to the institution with fine academic credentials, having graduated from Barnard College in Chemistry, Columbia University with the Masters in Psychology.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.390" offset="1337535">She had one year in PhD program in a Pharmacology at Duke which was the same as the first year medical student curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.897" offset="1367523">She attended the Womens' Medical College of Pennsylvania and for some four-five years, prior to admission in University of Missouri worked at the National Institute of Hill.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.055" offset="1576189">Safe physician as here was described in testimony at the Trial Court, is that the student has sufficient medical knowledge, basic science knowledge and the student has the ability to function in a clinical setting with patients, so as to render primary care to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.871" offset="1663438">Now it has been explained that, that does not mean that the student is all knowledgeable and every conceivable medical question that would come up, but to be a safe physician, the student would have to have sufficient knowledge to know that was going to be necessary to obtain the assistance of other physicians or health care professionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.261" offset="1749016">So, the global institution and that of being a safe physician is that they can render care to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.059" offset="1792170">Now, primary medical care, not advanced specialized type care, because naturally that comes from internships in residencies after they would graduate from a medical school.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.546" offset="1942113">Now the school at University of Missouri Kansas City is a school, which is referred to as a docent type institution, whereby they have shortened the years over all, but they require going to school eleven months out of the year.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.784" offset="2123089">That is true Your Honor, the school has very readily stated from the very beginning, it is the reason that the school was established was the responsibility to provide Doctors to render primary care and the school encourages students and notifies them to that fact when they are interviewed for admission to the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.454" offset="2197799">And the respondent in this case at the time of application to this school and interview, was so advised that the school requires not only basic medical science knowledge, but a clinical competency, that all students were going to be judged on the same basis, as far as meeting any requirements for graduation.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.222" offset="2284839">Clinical competency, Your Honor is the ability for doctor to function in a patient setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.106" offset="2324336">It is the ability to take the basic medical science knowledge which one learns from books and to apply that to a given patient, to a given situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.521" offset="2369998">It involves all the way from acquiring a total and complete medical history from the patient to the proper type of examinations, the proper type of testing and then the ability to relate the basic medical knowledge into a diagnosis and a formulation plan whereby that patient can be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.533" offset="2470100">And this is unfortunately the position where the institution found that the responded in this case was not deemed to be qualified.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.376" offset="2637492">It is unfortunate but the individual apparently assume that she could become a doctor by reading a book, and not treating patients and getting the necessary experience there.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.723" offset="2690887">The clinical competency of that evaluation was naturally on subjective judgment of the professors that she was under and that viewed her performance in a clinical setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.196" offset="5200731">We requested, a rehearing a transfer Court in bank the Chief Justice of the Eight Circuit wrote a dissent joined by two other judges pointing out that they had misinterpreted Greenhill and one of the other judges that joined in the dissent actually wrote the opinion in Greenhill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.740" offset="5286936">Now, the Eight Circuit also relied upon the Roth decision of this court in 1972, Now, Roth involved a nontenured professor in the state of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.649" offset="5358511">The court in that case did not find a deprivation of liberty interest nor did find a deprivation of property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.007" offset="5407935">The court looked to the law of Wisconsin, looked to rules and regulations of the institution as to whether or not there was a property interest and found none to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.987" offset="5463941">Now, I would submit that in the case we have before the court today, that a student in higher education in the state of Missouri does not have a right to a medical education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.248" offset="5524963">There are no statutes in the state of Missouri extending such right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.681" offset="5542622">Secondly the university of Missouri the rules and regulations of that university do not extend such a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.605" offset="5582328">With respect to the liberty interest, it was covered in Roth, the court looked to the good name reputation, honor and integrity as to whether or not it was adversely affected by what the government was doing to the given individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.405" offset="5665607">As I previously stated, the court found in that case that there was not a stigma, there was not a liberty interest because of the fact that there was no showing that there was a charge or allegation of dishonesty, immorality or that the charge is going to seriously damage the standing of the individual in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.811" offset="5767171">Now, I would submit to the court that this is certainly the situation in the case that we are considering today because the university at no point in time has ever challenged the honesty, the morality, the integrity or the intellectual ability of this student.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.645" offset="5858495">I would further submit that the liberty interest, the medical student and the University of Missouri is not any greater than the liberty interest of a non tenured professor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.831" offset="5919308">Now in the Roth decision it was pointed out that the individual might be some what less attractive for other employment and I do not think there is any question of what the individual would be some what less attractive but the individual was not foreclosed from seeking other employment, even in the state of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.284" offset="6025051">I would submit that in the case that which we have, I do not think there is any question of what the student would be somewhat less attracted to other medical schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.509" offset="7065979">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.139" offset="7080503">The respondent Charlotte Horowitz in this case was admitted to the medical school as the petitioners have acknowledged in the Fall of 1971 as an advanced standing student.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.899" offset="7119582">At that time it is correct that she was expected to graduate within approximately two years, although the evidence in the record appearing at pages 87 and 88 of the testimony is that that was the bare minimum of time which it would require her to graduate because she did not have the extensive medical background that some of her classmates admitted as advanced standing had, such as having completed degree in oral surgery, that two years was a bare minimum when she was admitted to this medical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.725" offset="7234834">At the time, she was admitted to the medical school, there were no course requirements for graduation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.476" offset="7257822">It was not specified and the parties have stipulated this in stipulation 92 that appears at page 25 of the appendix that there were no particular number of courses had to be passed in order to graduate and that there were was no particular number of courses which if failed would result in dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.207" offset="7328771">The parties have also stipulated that stipulation number 29 at page 12, that this student passed every single course by receiving a satisfactory grade in every course up until may 1, 1973 at the time the committees finally determined she would not graduate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.758" offset="7398988">In addition, the term satisfactory completion of the course is defined by the stipulations of the party at stipulation 82 on page 23 has meaning that this student had met the standards of acceptable performance by students at this school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.553" offset="7466175">So, at the time she had virtually completed her two years of the medical school, she had passed every single course by receiving a satisfactory grade and it had been so informed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1867.123" offset="7548408">The courses she took included clinical rotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.435" offset="7561678">For instance, pediatric was a rotation which she took which included clinical exposure to sick children as well as to the healthy children and she received a satisfactory grade for that and was communicated to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.461" offset="7617789">But, the same time she was completing that course and during that course some of the faculty were adversely evaluating her performance and were documenting their beliefs that her performance was somewhat less than satisfactory and yet from the record it is clear that she never saw those evaluations until after this litigation was commenced and they were produced in discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.216" offset="7704829">She did not know that she had been deemed by some of her professors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.741" offset="7718936">That she had although received a satisfactory grade had not satisfactorily enough completed those courses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.611" offset="7750387">She did know however, that she was having some difficulties in clinical competence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.630" offset="7766478">The first that she learned was the July 5, 1972 letter placing her on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.790" offset="7791138">That letter which appears in the Appendix at page 180, however reflects only a concern about her relationships with other persons and then, with regard to the clinical aspect of that states that in order to improve her relationships with other person, she needs to begin keeping to establish schedules and meeting all clinical responsibilities on time and gracefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.390" offset="7897509">We are still not certain as to what on meeting a clinical responsibility gracefully means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.082" offset="7916317">But, that was the first reference to some allegation that she was somehow deficient in clinical abilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.862" offset="8603442">Now, when if the Court agrees that there is a foreclosure of a range of professional or employment opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.808" offset="8635207">Then a due process hearing is required but the format of that due process hearing can be determined by the institution within the guidelines of Matthews v. Eldridge decision of this Court and in the example that you gave, a student who flunked some courses in history in an undergraduate college might find the due process requirements satisfied simply by a letter from the Dean indicating that the student had failed courses A, B and C and that the student differed with that finding that he could appear in the Dean's office on Friday at 1:30 and if they would like to see the records, he could ask in advance for them to be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.429" offset="8781701">And he could have a hearing with the Dean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.301" offset="8789120">I believe that would suffice and in many educational institutions do that informally or formally now throughout the nation and so requiring a due process hearing before student is expelled would not place any substantial burden upon any of the educational institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.029" offset="8848052">In a professional graduate situation however, if the due process hearing under Matthews v. Eldridge type of test might be somewhat more involved.</text>
