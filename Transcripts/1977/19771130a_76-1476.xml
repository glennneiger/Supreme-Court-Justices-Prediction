            <text syncTime="49.510" offset="278008">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.522" offset="298070">The issue before the Court in this case involves interpretation of the Miller Act, which is of the utmost importance to the construction industry, particularly those contractors doing construction for the federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.902" offset="367556">The petitioners maintain that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, misconstrued the Miller Act in defining the term subcontractor and in holding that the respondents may maintain this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.740" offset="434952">We feel Your Honors that the decision of the Court of Appeals is contrary to this Court’s opinion in Clifford F. MacEvoy which was decided back in 1944 and also the case of F. D. Rich Co. which was decided in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.379" offset="509453">Also, Your Honors we submit that the Court of Appeals’ decision for the District of Columbia Circuit is contrary of the holdings of the First, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Circuits which have all passed in this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.965" offset="567758">We believe those decisions are consistent with the Rich case and with the MacEvoy case and they are in proper interpretations of the terms of the Miller Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.758" offset="622929">The material facts are very simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.029" offset="636095">The General Service Administration awarded a contract to Bateson to bill in addition to the Howard University Hospital in Washington D.C., a contract of some $39 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.449" offset="685727">Bateson subcontracted to Pierce Associates all of the mechanical work which consisted of the heating, ventilation, air conditioning and also included the installation of a automatic fire sprinkler system.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.301" offset="737136">Pierce Associates in turn entered into a subcontract agreement with Colquitt Sprinkler Co. where the installation for the automatic sprinkler system.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.330" offset="781231">Colquitt had a collective-bargaining agreement with the respondent union and under the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement, Colquitt was required to withhold certain union dues and fringe-benefits from the pay of its employees and paid over to the union trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.696" offset="858762">Colquitt got into financial trouble, failed to pay these monies over for the period of May 1973, through December '73 and the Union Trustees thereupon gave notice to Bateson under the Miller Act which is required within 90 days after the last of the work is done and thereafter when Bateson refused to make payment, they brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Rephan</label>
            <text syncTime="231.325" offset="1005257">Yes, Your Honor, we will concede that issue and I think it was resolved in another case by this Court; however, we do maintain they are one tier down and they are at a little bit different position in the one case we referred to.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.799" offset="1059174">How Colquitt did do installation work on the job?</text>
            <text syncTime="248.965" offset="1075788">They did not simply furnish material?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Jack Rephan</label>
            <text syncTime="250.859" offset="1083416">That is true Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.374" offset="1089476">They actually before in the installation and furnishing of the sprinkler system itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.442" offset="1121763">Now, in the MacEvoy case, this Court had before the issue of whether a material man to a material man on a federal construction project was covered under the terms of the Miller Act and after reviewing the statute and the legislative history, the Court said that the bond ran only to those material men, and laborers, and subcontractors who deal directly with the prime contractor and those material men, laborers and subcontractors who lacking any express or implied contract with the prime contractor, nevertheless had a direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor and who give the requisite 90 day notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.509" offset="1305979">This principle was reaffirmed by this Court, we believe Your Honors in the Rich case, the distinction in Rich was that the material men or subcontractor in that case, a company by the name of SERPAC had two contracts with the prime contractor, one contract was to furnish the plywood for the exterior of the project and the other contract was to detail and install all of the mill work.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.781" offset="1427082">There were some other very important facts in that case namely, that the stock holdings for the two companies were closely interrelated, the management of the two companies were interrelated they had done work on other projects and we believe Your Honors that in that case when the Court said, we have got to look beyond the terms of the contract to see whether or not SERPAC was functioning as a material man or as a subcontractor, that the Court had in mind that distinction and this was the purpose of applying a substantial relationship test in the Rich case to determine whether or not the middle party was a subcontractor or a material man.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.515" offset="1617985">I think Your Honors, if I might refer you to the opinion of the Ninth Circuit in that case, where the Ninth Circuit said that this distinction between subcontractors and material men turns on a substantiality and importance of the relationship between the middle party and the prime contractor.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="402.224" stopTime="407.570">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="402.224" offset="1688829">Does that really make sense to you or do you support it?</text>

          <turn speaker="jack_rephan" startTime="407.570" stopTime="421.661">
            <label>Mr. Jack Rephan</label>
            <text syncTime="407.570" offset="1710250">Your Honor, if you go back to the purpose of the Miller Act, it may make some sense because historically, and even the District of Columbia Mechanic's Lien Law, for example limits, the coverage to a subcontractor not beyond.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="421.661" stopTime="448.798">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="421.661" offset="1766570">But does it not make then, a lot more sense, as they are talking about the substantiality of the relationship to draw the line between the traditional material man who simply furnishes goods to the job site which are installed by another entity and a subcontractor who installs the stuff, actually puts the stuff into the ground that he can no longer lien for because it is public ground?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_rephan" startTime="448.798" stopTime="557.047">
            <label>Mr. Jack Rephan</label>
            <text syncTime="448.798" offset="1875135">Yes, Your Honor, I would agree that, that probably makes more sense than to apply this test in a vacuum and I think that is what the Court of Appeals did.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.938" offset="1915677">They misconstrued and misread what this Court was talking about when they used the substantiality test that the Court in the Rich case was trying to ascertain whether this party was a material man or was a subcontractor and they elect to both contracts the entire relationship between the parties and SERPAC was doing contract work, they were not limited to supplying of material and that is what the Court had in mind of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.598" offset="2034377">Now, the question here is whether or not, Colquitt, the sprinkler installer was a subcontractor and we feel under the traditional view and the traditional definition of the term subcontractor that Colquitt was not a subcontractor, sure they were installing work, they were installing some of the materials on the job, but if we go back to the definition of subcontract, it would this Court referred to in the MacEvoy case one who takes part of the work from the prime contractor, we maintain Colquitt is not within that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.594" offset="2190276">Colquitt is a sub-subcontractor and these terms have been used in the construction industry and day-to-day references of the term for many years and we believe there is a distinction between a subcontractor and a sub-subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.402" offset="2257567">And certainly Congress, we feel had this distinction in mind, and the committee reports because they said a sub-subcontractor is covered by the Act but that is as far as it goes.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.668" offset="2818573">The statute requires only those persons having a direct contract with a subcontractor to give notice and only to the prime contractor, this would leave out a subcontractor such as Pierce here.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.207" offset="2876774">Pierce in effect would have no notice that Colquitt had not paid their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.039" offset="2896104">The notice would go to the prime contractor and Pierce of course, is one of those protected parties under the Miller Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.262" offset="2932989">Peirce had a direct contract with the prime contractor and therefore it is expressly covered under the Act and the question arises in my mind Your Honors, as why at the end did Congress not provide that those tiers below that first-tier subcontractor give notice to the subcontractor, so that he could protect himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.303" offset="3025149">In fact, in this case if there is going to be double payment it would be by Pierce Associates, the first-tier subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.646" offset="3070498">I think it is important for the Court to carefully read the Rich's decision because I think the Rich decision and again I think too that the all of the cases which were cited in the Rich case, I believe in a footnote on the principle relied on by the Court to define the term subcontractor, involved a situation where the party, we were talking about, to be a material man or being the subcontractor, had some sort of a contractor relationship with the prime.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.571" offset="3198184">Now, there are cases where you have a prime contractor, you have another corporation may be a wholly own subsidiary, of the prime, and the courts in those cases have more or less, pierced a corporate veil.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.826" offset="3255236">They do not feel where you have a wholly own controlled subsidiary, that has no economic reality that a prime contractor should be able to put this buried in there and push the material men or laborers down one tier and therefore exclude them from the coverage of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.626" offset="6454504">You have asked sir, whether the state Mechanic's Lien Laws covered this problem and you did not see any discussion of it in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.706" offset="6494733">It is our view that when Congress adopted the Miller Act, the main purpose or in fact as Chairman Miller stated in the legislative history, the purpose of the Act was merely to correct the procedural problems in the Heard Act, so they were not adopting the Miller Act to try to conform it with state Mechanic's Lien Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.686" offset="6598700">They were trying to correct the procedural difficulties in the Heard Act, those difficulties were that there was only one bond, the Government had the first opportunity to sue, contractors had to wait six months before they could sue, all of the suites had to be joined in one proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.462" offset="6669753">These items, or difficulties made it impossible for contractors to collect their money on Government jobs, and as a result they were forced to settle for a lot less than what their claims were worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.410" offset="6717610">That was the purpose of the Miller Act and under the Heard Act, anybody who supplied labor or material to the job was entitled to go against the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.047" offset="6780095">In other words, it was not -- there was not a question of privity involved as we submit the petition --</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.263" offset="7000986">What the Miller Act did was, provide an opportunity for a general contract or a prime contractor to protect himself from remote claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.552" offset="7186142">Now, the trustees who brought this suit are trustees of a jointly administered Pension Welfare Entrepreneurship Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.502" offset="7233998">In other words, there are equal number of employer and union trustees on this fund or actually there are three funds involved, the money that they were trying to obtain was the contribution that Colquitt in its collective-bargaining agreement promised to make to these funds every month on behalf of the employees to fund their pension benefits, health and insurance benefits and educational benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.806" offset="7331174">In addition, the union is a respondent in this case and was a plaintiff because Colquitt withheld money from the wages of the employees, part of which was to go towards union dues and the other deduction was to go to a vacation savings plan set up individual savings accounts in banks for each employee, of course, the employees never got this money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.164" offset="7432633">Now, it is our view that what the Court of Appeals did hear was look at the facts in the case, for example, it found that the sprinkler system installed by Colquitt was specifically required by Bateson’s contract with the Government, it found that sprinkler system was an integral and significant part of the whole building, it found the work that Colquitt did was performed over substantial period of time and it found that the work was important and in support of that it showed or the Court pointed out that the work done by Colquitt’s employees was taken over by Pierce when Colquitt went broke or was unable to perform anymore.</text>

            <text syncTime="2248.025" offset="9072078">Well, my answer to that would be first that, at best it is ambiguous because the Act itself does not define a subcontractor, so with the Act not defining a subcontractor, it is difficult to assume then that the House Report when it refers to sub-subcontractor was referring to a definition at which the petitioner urges here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.277" offset="9185032">In other words, I think the functional definition that this Court laid out in Rich is a more appropriate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.014" offset="9215961">Furthermore, I believe that again as this Court has pointed out many times, there is extensive legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.875" offset="9251487">On the other side of this problem, and that is the legislative history, in fact, comments by Chairman Miller one of which I mentioned earlier that the basic purpose of the Miller Act was merely to straighten out these problems with the Heard Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.799" offset="9319092">Now, with that being repeated over and over again in the legislative history, I find it difficult to attribute to Congress then, by that one statement in the House Report, a wholesale elimination of classes of people who were previously covered, in effect to adopt that statement as some sort of controlling criteria, would mean that Congress decided they were going to cover just tip of the Iceberg and eliminate all these other people that previously be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.326" offset="9453257">I believe that before we could look at that statement as controlling there would have to be far more legislative history similar to that or at least defining what they meant by subcontractor in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.213" offset="9512816">If I may, the point I would like to make with regard to the remoteness argument and I believe I partially got into it, but I would like to stress the fact that I do not believe that Congress can be assumed, or it can be presumed that Congress intended when it adopted the Miller Act to let coverage under that Act, be controlled by the contractors who were on the job and basically if we adopt petitioner’s contention that is what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.880" offset="9679478">If Pierce decides to do the work himself, Pierce’s employees are covered, if Pierce decides to subcontract that work to Colquitt or somebody else to do the work, Colquitt’s employees are not covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.205" offset="9820748">Yes, in the sense that you could not have the mechanic’s lien on a federal project, the Heard Act provided for the bond to give the laborers and other persons who supplied material on the job, opportunities to collect, but I think this point is particularly crucial that the rights of both laborers and material men to seek recovery under the Miller Act bond, under the petitioner’s contention rests on how much sub delegation the prime or someone for example in Pierce’s condition decides he wants to on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.833" offset="9995246">This we submit is totally inconsistent with the Rich case and for that reason we believe that the Rich case even if it is not found controlling in this situation because it involved a supplier to a material man.</text>

            <text syncTime="2524.014" offset="10176013">The another factor which I think demonstrates that the petitioner’s privity type argument is not valid in interpreting the Miller Act, is the situation we have here where Pierce took over the job after Colquitt was unable to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.087" offset="10288340">Now, under the petitioner’s theory of the case, on the last day these people worked for Colquitt, they were not covered under the Miller Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.995" offset="11367928">It would have then had language sub sub sub sub or sub of the first, second, third, fourth tier, that type of language, I do not believe that we are going to attribute to Congress that intent in view of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.902" offset="11555592">The problem that the Bateson claims exist and that is how is he going to be able to get all these bonds that were going to be bonding contractors down the row.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.125" offset="11608464">We do not believe exists because there are several ways that Bateson can protect themselves, one of which of course is requiring bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.362" offset="11637407">He required one of Pierce, that certainly proves he can do, but he did not have to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.024" offset="11656007">Pierce could certainly have required one of Colquitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.134" offset="11668441">Now, why Pierce did not require one to Colquitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.884" offset="11679517">The record does not show, counsel indicates this because Colquitt could not get bonded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.498" offset="11701982">Well, if that is so, in effect then, Pierce is telling the employees, I want Colquitt on the job probably had a low price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.264" offset="11749002">Colquitt can not get bonded, so if Colquitt goes belly up who is going to bear the risk of that, you employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.338" offset="11781290">I simply cannot attribute that intent to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.589" offset="11802292">Now, with regard to the argument that was somewhat touched down by counsel and argued extensively in the briefs and that is that the interpretation, they are suggesting would be more fair to small contractors that the interpretation we are proposing, would in effect eliminate small contractors from coming on jobs because they could not get bonds and people like Pierce’s now on would require small contractors to get bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.962" offset="11963833">I think the argument is not appropriate in this case for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.078" offset="11992255">First, the small contractors can merely be on both sides of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.704" offset="12018795">They could just as easily be claimants as they can defaulters for example, if Colquitt had subbed out half of his sprinkler system job to a small contractor, that small contractor would be standing in the shoes of Colquitt’s employees and also would come up empty handed, so I doubt if a small contractor is going to take much comfort in petitioner’s argument, that we want to get you on the job, even though you cannot be bonded and then have that same small contractor find out that when he cannot get paid, he cannot go against the bond either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.244" offset="12180963">Furthermore, we do not believe that the philosophy of the Miller Act was that the employee should bear the responsibility for a marginally weak contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.766" offset="12247001">Certainly the federal Government has provided other means to get jobs for small contractors and federal projects.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Rephan</label>
            <text syncTime="3131.230" offset="12604878">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.124" offset="12608431">Very briefly, one of the very difficult problems we have with the test urged by the respondents is it is an unworkable test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.203" offset="12648764">Here we had a $39 million contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.778" offset="12659109">Sprinkler work with approximately 155,000 and 156,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.156" offset="12680529">If we use a substantiality test let us assume we had sprinkler system in one room as $10,000 by their subcontractor, suppose it is $500,000 or they have subcontractor and who is going to make these determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.196" offset="12744686">It is going to be the general contractor, who obviously is not in a position to do so because they are not awarding the sub-sub-subcontractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.187" offset="12776660">It is going to have to be the subcontractor and in turn his subcontractor on down the line and we believe Your Honor it is really, truly an unworkable test as far as drawing the lines, we think this Court recognized that Congress in the Miller Act drew the line not rightly or wrongly, it may well be that extension of the Miller Act should be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.210" offset="12868820">We feel that is a matter for Congress that they feel this way they can redefine the coverage, but we think the way as to find right now this was an attempt by Congress to draw a line to show some definition and we think the Court of Appeals decision violates that boundary line, in effect it eliminates the proviso of Section 2 of the Act which this Court had before in the Rich case and MacEvoy case and which was to the proviso involved in all of the Circuit Court opinions who held that a subcontractor is a subcontractor in the usual meaning of this term and this term was used in the building trade industries, and certainly this Court recognized that in MacEvoy and we think this is what Congress meant when they said subcontractor.</text>
