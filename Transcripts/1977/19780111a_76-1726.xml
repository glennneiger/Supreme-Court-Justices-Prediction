            <text syncTime="650.644" offset="2682520">I would like to touch upon another point the petitioner raises.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.014" offset="2704045">If this Court restricts the applicability of the maritime law to territorial allowance, the three mile limit, it may then return to what is known as a locality test which was denounced by the Court as a test alone at least for jurisdictional purposes in the Executive Jet case by way of illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.632" offset="2838419">A widow of a seaman who was fairly injured as a result of the breach of a maritime duty within the three mile limit could recover nonpecuniary losses and the widow of the seaman who was fairly injured on the high seas as a result of the breach of same maritime duty could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.645" offset="2930475">This is basically unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.427" offset="2949701">It illustrated further those are always aware of the amount of field activity off the coast to Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.814" offset="2991183">Boats and ships are constantly moving from the shore line and to the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.344" offset="3025351">It would impose a most onerous burden upon litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.319" offset="3045204">If he were entitled or, if his survivors were entitled to recover nonpecuniary losses within the three mile limit and the litigants were not positive of where the injury or death occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.143" offset="3120542">Louisiana's coastline as Your Honors know from arguments in other cases involving boundaries of meander, islands appear, disappear and reappear, and it is quite difficult to ascertain for a litigant where the boundaries are.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.939" offset="3203715">In addition, the locality test is just in basis and unfair and unrealistic test.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.081" offset="3284277">Now, I would like to touch just briefly upon the Court's decision in the Barbe case which petitioner brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.970" offset="3319804">The Barbe case concerned itself with the survival provisions of the general maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.169" offset="3352613">Barbe court recognized the existence, and I use that language because I believe what this Court did in Moragne was recognized the existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.033" offset="3408097">It restored what was once known as a cause of action for wrongful death under the general maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.366" offset="3437355">It did not create a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.529" offset="3446027">The Barbe court recognized the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.626" offset="3462432">Under the survival provisions of the general maritime law using the same, reasoning the same methodology as this Court did in Moragne and Gaudet.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.675" offset="3498690">It allowed recovery for conscious pain and suffering of the decedent, but denied recovery of funeral expenses for some reason which has been categorized as absurd by some on the basis that funeral expenses would have been incurred at some future date anyway and of course if that logic would carry out, there would be no reason for Wrongful Death Acts because people are bound to reach the terminal stage with life.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.393" offset="3645498">We think the decision of the Barbe court was completely illogical and would create additional anomalies than those which existed pre Moragne.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.335" offset="3721253">Finally, I would like to touch upon the Gaudet decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.268" offset="3765035">The principal reasons for dissent by some members of the panel of this Court in Gaudet were present in the Gaudet case and do not exist in this case or in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.139" offset="3828460">In first place no suit was brought by the decedent prior to death presumably decedents were killed instantaneously and there is no problem of Res judicata or collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.170" offset="3888646">Secondly, there was no possibility of a double recovery as the Court was concerned with.</text>
