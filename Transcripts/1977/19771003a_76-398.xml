            <text syncTime="43.552" offset="254180">My name is William Humphreys and I represent the petitioner in this case, the Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.922" offset="279676">The case arises out of Title 12, Section 94 of the United States code which is known as the National Bank Venue Act and the case involves the application and interpretation of that bank venue provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.176" offset="348639">The interpretation of that statute requires this court to decide whether the statute requires that a National bank only be sued in its home county, that is, the county which is specified in its certificate of organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.585" offset="414259">A second issue that must be decided by the court in order for any decision on the merits as to the interpretation of the statute to be rendered meaningful is whether a National Bank may waive the provisions of Section 94 by the establishment of a branch bank in a county other than a county where it is chartered.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.603" offset="1098354">So that even if, as I understand it, if you select county A, then you cannot move that county, your principal office over fifty miles.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.376" offset="2477410">There was probably no policy argument for not writing a statute that will allow a branch of bank to be sued at any place, it had a branch, for calls of action arising out of the business activities conducted in that branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.769" offset="2543029">I do not believe there would probably be a very good policy argument for not giving the bank the same wide venue that a corporation has.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.284" offset="2585034">12 U.S.C. 94 contains two basic provisions, one is a federal provision and a one is a state provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.846" offset="2611366">The federal provision says simply that a bank may be sued in any county or in any federal court, in any district in which the bank is established; and the state court provision provides that a bank in for state court purposes may be sued in any state municipal county court in the county in which it is located and these two provisions were enacted, one in 1863, the federal court provision, and one in 1864, the state court provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.282" offset="2745113">Now, the Georgia Court of Appeals decided that since Congress had used a different word 'located' in describing the venue for national banks then it did when it described the venue for national banks which was connected to the word established and that therefore a Congress must have intended for located to have different meaning, a broader meaning than the word 'established' and therefore Congress must have intended for banks to be sued in every county in which they were located.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.409" offset="2925567">I believe the Georgia Court of Appeals as in other courts, state courts are trying to find ways to expand their venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.142" offset="2956496">That has always been the case and they looked at the dictionary not the Georgia Court of Appeals but the Security Mills vs. Wachovia case in North Carolina took a run through the dictionary to look at the various words and definitions of 'locate' and 'establish'.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.773" offset="3023056">This is not a very fruitful task because one of the synonymous meanings or synonyms for locate is to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.424" offset="3053671">So having done that to still give them opposite meanings does not make a lot of sense and that's particularly true in light of the conditions that existed in 1863, as we have said there were not branch banks in 1863, a bank could only do business in one place, the county in which its Certificate of Organization was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.763" offset="3134964">But more importantly the jurisdiction of the state in federal courts in 1863 and 1864 was concurrent with regard to national banks and this to me is very important in deciding whether located and established mean the same thing, because until 1882, any suit against the national bank could be brought in the first instance in federal court without regard to diversity and without regard to amount involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.002" offset="3251993">Similarly, any suit brought in state court could also be removed to a federal court since the federal courts had concurrent and original jurisdiction and therefore it seems to me that the argument becomes even more untenable that a federal court, that Congress intended for state courts to have a broader venue and to permit suits in more state courts than in federal courts with this concurrent jurisdiction and the same really holds true today, because if a diversity suit were brought in Georgia in a branch, in a place other than where the bank was established, the bank could remove that case to federal court, and the federal courts are clearly unanimous in holding that the word established refers only to the place specified in the bank's certificate of organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="882.723" offset="3610811">So I submit that the first argument or consideration that should not control in this case is any consideration that the word located and established had different meanings as used by Congress in 1863 and 1864.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.557" offset="3666190">Whatever, interpretation is given to the word located in this case and this is clearly a state court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.382" offset="3689492">It is not, does not arise in the federal court, but whatever interpretation this court gives to the word 'located' it also must give to the word 'established' and it is clear, as we have, I think mentioned briefly before that located and established when used in 1863 and 1864 referred only to one place.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.712" offset="3782801">There was only one place in existence at 1863 and 1864 and that was the place that the bank was chartered.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.410" offset="3817596">Now further more, if you read the language of section 94 carefully it is very apparent that although Congress might have mingled the words located and established, it was very particular as to when it intended to note a potential plurality and when it intended to mean the singular and thus the statute provides that the suit may be brought in any district or territorial court of the United States, and it further provides that the suit may be maintained in any state, county or municipal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.776" offset="3979033">There is a potential plurality of courts that I believe could be found from that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.403" offset="4001603">On the other hand, Congress was quite explicit that it should only be maintained in the district, the one district, I would suggest in which the bank was established and in the one city or county in which the bank was located.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.312" offset="6621162">That argument is not found on judicial precedent and if the court would think about it as I know it will, it occurs to me that never before in American Jurisprudence have we decided that venue can be waved presumptively by pre-litigation conduct, the only case that even suggests that, if that sort of rule was adopted every case that comes before a trial court, the judge is now going to be faced with an argument of he presumptively waved venue by some conduct inconsistent with it, in advance of trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.229" offset="6812900">But that was very narrow, they found to express consent to be sued by the appointment of agent for service of process and I would suggest that Neirbo can never be cited or used without considering Olberding which was decided in 1953, by Justice Frankfurt because Neirbo be read too expansively or can be used too expansively without reading Olberding because in Olberding the argument was made that a non resident motorist passing through the state, and this was not a jurisdiction question this was on venue, they had decided constitutionality of the non resident motorist statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.254" offset="6956992">But this non resident motorist was passing through a state and for some reason venue requirements were not met because neither the plaintiff nor defendant were residents of that state and the defendant assorted his venue right and the court said, now you waived venue because we have got our non resident statute that says when you are passing through the state you waive a venue, if you have an automobile wreck and you appoint the Secretary of State to receive process although there no specific appointment was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.029" offset="7072035">And justice Frankfurt has said that but to conclude that a motorist who never consented to be sued has agreed to be sued and therefore waived federal court venue as to move in the world of Alice in Wonderland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.159" offset="7120623">In other words, that non resident motorist had not consented expressly to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.915" offset="7143611">There is no case that this court has considered other than Neirbo in which a pre-litigation waiver has been allowed and in Neirbo the court was very specific to say that it was because they had expressly appointed an agent for service of process and therefore had expressly consented to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.766" offset="7226994">Now what the proponents of the waiver argument would seek now is to say that any Act inconsistent with assorting venue that you do prior to trial will result in waiver of venue such as erecting a branch bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.769" offset="7286971">Well I submit that individuals do things all the time in consistent with the normal state venue right of to be sued in your home county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.619" offset="7322393">But no court has ever said that because if you are an individual, you go to another county and commit a tort that you have waived venue, you have a waived venue if the statute says you have a right to be sued where you live, you do not waive that statute prior to litigation, and that is what we would contend this statute says that the bank has a right to be sued where it maintains its home offices.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.573" offset="7458229">Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court, I am Mike Kovacich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.163" offset="7484561">I think Mr. Humphreys has outlined to you the crunch of the matter and it basically boils down to a statutory interpretation and there have been decisions which were cited in the briefs from various lower federal courts and state appellate courts dealing with this question in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.893" offset="7607545">This case is revolved basically around two theories of interpretation, as far as holding for the position which I contend is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.692" offset="7670762">The first theory, and this was the one predominantly followed by the Georgia court is the dichotomy in language between the words established and located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.767" offset="7719036">The ruling was basically and because of this dichotomy in language, once the bank set up a branch, county other than its chartered county, if you want to use that term, that it was located there, and could be sued there, and therefore in compliance with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.578" offset="7830213">The second theory is that of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.704" offset="7846723">That is that act of establishing a branch bank in and of itself constituted waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.833" offset="7883294">This is what Mr. Humphreys discussed when he said pre-litigation waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.488" offset="7913909">That is the basis of the decisions in some of the lower federal courts which are cited in my brief and in some of the state court decisions which are also cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.204" offset="7976812">But as I said it revolves around this question of interpreting the statute as to litigation in federal court which is not really what we have got here but it has been brought in for a consideration and looking at the entire picture, I would agree with Mr. Humphreys, that the established does mean that particular county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.884" offset="8087467">I do not know whether that is quite a case for state litigation and I would not go so far as to concede that, but I think as some of these federal decisions have held the establishment or the conduct of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.734" offset="8154863">There were one or two decisions and there is also a recent Florida appellate decision which dealt with the question of doing business and this gets us in part as to what is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.616" offset="8226438">Some of these cases have contained a recitation of like the Reeves (ph) case, the 66 branches in the Southern District of California and all of that, the Wyle (ph) and this brings upon the question that Justice Rehnquist posed before in Wyle (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.081" offset="8308254">You may not be aware that DeKalb and Fulton counties are bordered next to each other and part of the city of Atlanta is located in DeKalb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.444" offset="8341691">I think that as Mr. Humphrey's response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist indicates a considerable portion of CNS's business by volume as in DeKalb and Fulton counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.732" offset="8406892">I am sure the business in DeKalb is several times what it is in Chatham county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.768" offset="8435000">And as to the question raised by Mr. Justice Blackmun about their using the courts in DeKalb, as pointed out in my brief, there was earlier litigation dealing with one of the loans that led to the unlawful redemption as we have alleged in our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.324" offset="8513263">It was litigation in regard to that, filed by the bank in the exact court that this litigation --</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.101" offset="8608349">Mr. Chief Justice, but what I am raising here is the fact that besides using the court, the bank has established branches and is conducting active business and uses the courts as a part of conducting that business and has become a part and parcel of that county and this leads into somewhat the point that Mr. Humphreys raised about, does going to another county and committing a tort waive an individual's venue, and he said no it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.127" offset="8772502">I believe, that is a correct statement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.026" offset="8784100">But many states Georgia included, provide a corporation can be sued in any county in which it commits a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.966" offset="8835823">You can sue a corporation in a county where the tort is committed or in a contract matter where the contract is entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.382" offset="8865498">So I think courts have recognized different jurisdictional and venue requirements as to corporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.802" offset="12255147">The other as I said and this was the basis on which the George Court Of Appeals rendered its decision, is that by establishing a branch bank, the bank located itself in that respective county, for suit under that court's interpretation of this act without getting in to any waiver but I think that on either application that the motion of the bank, the original motion of the bank to be dismissed was properly denied and I would respectfully request that this court affirm, the decision of the Georgia Court of Appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.572" offset="12462246">I think throughout the argument both parties seem to assume that when a federal venue is sought to be established, the bank can be established only in one place and that the branch would not be established within the meaning of the statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.180" offset="12524626">Has this court ever so held?</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.970" offset="12539777">I do not think so your Honor, I think the reason that both parties have taken that position is one we have not gone into that aspect of it and as great of depth as we are dealing with the state court issue and secondly the statue uses the word 'established' in regard to the federal district and as I understand that the federal laws which set up the procedure for a bank a national bank being chartered also used that exact term 'established' and so from that you draw possibly, an intention to mean the same thing and therefore you do get this home county aspect but to my knowledge as far as --</text>
