            <text syncTime="31.723" offset="206860">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.052" offset="216159">The National Society of Professional Engineers the petitioner here appears in the most extraordinary position.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.825" offset="243222">It is opposing the government in advocating the public interest by arguing for an ethical principle which protects the public against injury and clients against cheating.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.327" offset="289302">The government on the other hand takes the position that these matters are not matters for consideration by the court because it invokes the rubric of Per Se, indeed as I read the governments brief the term public interest does not appear in it once.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.678" offset="342696">The principle that we sustain that clears the solicitation of engineering work by competitive bidding before consultation with the client or determination of the scope of the work to be contrary to the public interest and therefore unethical.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.658" offset="402569">The alternative method of solicitation of work by bidding is the traditional, ethical method which involves an initial selection of an engineer by qualification, with fees proposed after consultation with the client and after determination of the scope of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.822" offset="475294">It is basic to understand that engineering involves solving practical problems by the application of science, there is a great deal of testimony on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.025" offset="516045">So that each engineering problem is essentially unique and indeed each engineering solution is really a new scientific invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.541" offset="558154">To determine the nature and the scope of engineering problems and their solution requires substantial consultation and negotiation between engineer and client.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.164" offset="600577">The fee is then calculated and the client is perfectly free to accept or reject any fee that is calculated and to engage the engineer or not engage the engineer and go on and negotiate with other engineers if he likes.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.916" offset="723666">I do not know that there is any specific statement on this subject, there is explicit testimony that there is nothing to prevent a client from negotiating with as many engineers as he likes even on the same day.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.651" offset="870579">There is a good deal of engineering work that goes into the sale of some complex electrical equipment that is manufactured by electric or equipment manufacturers too is it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="210.651" offset="922510">This principle incidentally has four important exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.653" offset="938602">In the first place it is confined exclusively to the design to work related to the design of real estate structures, it does not apply to research and development work, it does not apply to study contracts, it does not apply to so called turnkey contracts, engineering works that relates to the design of products to be manufactured is not involved in this principle for the very good reason that products are tested before they are sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.311" offset="1061168">The reason that this applies is that real estate structures are not tested, there are not prototypes.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.735" offset="1094918">R&amp;D work on the other hand results in a prototype.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.154" offset="1108607">A prototype is thoroughly tested before it is exposed to the public whereas real estate structures are occupied by the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.820" offset="1139222">There is no chance for testing them, if a building falls down the public is injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.206" offset="1156776">It is exclusively confined to matters that immediately affect public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.326" offset="1177256">So you say then that this principle what you are enunciating what your clients have enunciated is an exception for the engineers from the Per Se rule only in the case of structures on real property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lee_loevinger" startTime="291.704" stopTime="314.902">
            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="291.704" offset="1246742">I do not say it is an exception to the Per Se rule Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.052" offset="1260117">I say that the Per Se rule does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.557" offset="1274223">The argument for the Per Se rule applies because of the strange construction which says that because this some how or other affects price, therefore it is price fixing, therefore the Per Se rule applies, actually it is an entirely circular argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.902" offset="1339529">Well, let me -- perhaps I can ask you you a question that will solve my problem more quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.918" offset="1375578">Your distinction for antitrust purposes between manufacturers of electrical equipment who use -- which may be a one item deal and may take a great deal of engineering design skill and your client's code of ethics is that your client's code of ethics applies only to structures on real property which are not pretested for safety.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="347.593" offset="1470350">Yes sir, precisely.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="350.719" offset="1482785">Is their any way to -- I thought you said there is really no way to test a structure in the sense that you do prototype of an airplane or an automobile or wash machine.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lee_loevinger" startTime="363.528" stopTime="396.016">
            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="363.528" offset="1534089">Yes Mr. Chief Justice that as I understood Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question that this applies only to real estate structures precisely because they are not subject to testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.554" offset="1582154">If you are designing equipment for sale whether it is automobiles or gadgets or jewelery or whatever these are articles that are designed and manufactured in prototype and tested before sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.946" offset="1643699">Consequently the public has the protection of such testing and there are many opportunities for testing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="396.016" stopTime="407.296">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="396.016" offset="1663970">I suppose the substitute for that testing or at least the partial substitute is the building inspection which goes on from day to day or even hour to hour as a building is going up is that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lee_loevinger" startTime="407.296" stopTime="444.865">
            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="407.296" offset="1709109">There is in fact testimony on that precise subject which points out that the building codes are not adequate substitutes for the code of ethics because they are usually behind times, because they are not effectively enforced because they do not subject to buildings to the same kind of tests as they get from the engineer who was on top of the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.745" offset="1794896">In any event, we argue that to say that because there may be laws that relate to the same subject, therefore ethics are not applicable, it is inappropriate as to say that because there are laws against homicide therefore we do not need the Sixth commandment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="448.604" offset="1874412">Yes sir that is one of the incidents that was testified too by witness whom we call probably no case has ever come before this court involving the application of the rule of reason, in which there is been testimony that has been so inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.609" offset="1930419">We had as a witness the Head of the company that ensures over 60% of the professional engineers and architects of the country and who had over a period of 17 or 18 years personally investigated or in the later years when it became more, personally supervised the investigation of every malpractice claim that arose for this entire group of engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.423" offset="2029684">He kept statistics on the claims, on their causes he investigated the conditions under which the solicitation occurred and as matter of fact he concluded and the testimony stands uncontroverted in the record that there was a high correlation between the awarding of engineering jobs by bidding and claims of malpractice, inadequacy or negligence and it reached such a point that his company finally concluded that they would not issue malpractice insurance when there is any evidence of that a job has been awarded by bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.778" offset="2167088">That is how inclusive the evidence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.919" offset="2175656">In fact he testified to over 17500 claims that he had investigated and at the time of his testimony, the claims were coming in at the rate of 10 a day of which more than one every single day involved injury or death to a member of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.879" offset="2247441">That is how ubiquitous is the threat we are confronting and this case is and the government takes the position that this is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.453" offset="2277743">They do no take position -- simply it is not true they say it should not be considered by the court and the courts below believed them and proceeded on that basis and that is why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.355" offset="2329361">Now, there is a testimony of many eminent engineers which stands essentially uncontroverted in the record as to the public values of the ethical method of awarding engineering jobs and of the bidding method.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.831" offset="2407310">In the first place, the ethical method encourages a free exchange of information among engineers, the exchange of technical and scientific information whereas bidding tends to make them like businessmen who seek to hoard trade secrets and there is a public value in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.424" offset="2473661">There is no government response to this point and there were no findings by any of the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.651" offset="2502605">The second -- the ethical method was well testified, produces completely adequate plans which permits competitive bidding at the construction phase which incidentally costs about 20 times as much as the total cost of engineering and therefore increases and permits competition in construction whereas bidding results in inadequate and incomplete plans of the specifications and therefore frustrates competitive bidding at the construction phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.180" offset="2632695">There is no response to this point in the Government brief and no findings below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.097" offset="5268345">It would be useful I think for us to look at the text of the ethical rule which is the subject of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.100" offset="5304394">It is printed in the government's brief at page 4 as well as in the various opinions of the District Court, Court of Appeals and in findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.405" offset="5353609">It defines competitive bidding as the formal or informal submission or receipt, a verbal or written estimates of cost or proposals in terms of dollars man days of work required, percentage of construction cost or any other measure of compensation whereby the prospective client may compare engineering services on a price basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.273" offset="5477011">Prior to the time that one engineer or engineering organization has been selected for negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.493" offset="5505955">The disclosure of recommended fees schedules prepared by various engineering societies is not considered to be competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.622" offset="5542422">Now the purpose and affect of the rule were found by the Two Courts below to be the total suppression of price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.242" offset="5592891">Court of Appeals described it as a price maintenance mechanism.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.840" offset="9443340">It requires aims at fraud, at deception, at over-reaching, at disregard of engineering standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.886" offset="9471552">These are rules aimed at specific abuses but they were not before this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.682" offset="9490673">They were not before the District Court, the only thing before the Court is this total abolition of price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.442" offset="9525678">It is suggested that the case should nevertheless be reviewed under the rule of reason because a learned profession is involved or because price competition is unfeasible in engineering or because engineering affects public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.602" offset="9574370">Well, as I understand it NSPE now concedes that except for real estate construction, price competition is feasible in engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.278" offset="9613031">It is certainly practical for routine tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.976" offset="9623898">It applies in the most difficult area of all research and development contracts where it is most difficult to predict what cost will be and the engineers themselves have had fixed fee schedules for years in their state societies which this rule specifically refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.542" offset="9698086">Now that again implies that there are certainly tasks where price information can be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.931" offset="9731731">The second possibility for the rule of reason argument is that there is a learned profession exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.290" offset="9761093">Certainly in Goldfarb, there was a note of caution in footnote 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.663" offset="9790559">The court in holding that Goldfarb involved classic price fixing and learned professions were not exempt, also said in Footnote 17, there might be situations with the public service obligations of learned professions require different approach under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.004" offset="9859940">We express no view except with respect to the matters before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.049" offset="9888153">I think the short answer is that yes in the learned professions there may be different public service requirements that justify a rule of reason approach where would not apply in other professions or other activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2504.357" offset="10097341">Finally there is another aspect to this learned profession problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.888" offset="10119493">Up to now in the antitrust laws we have not considered rule of reason or per se except in terms of the market place, in terms of competitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.848" offset="10199323">A per se rule is a rule which on balance between pro-competitive effects and anti-competitive effects almost always has anticompetitive effects and therefore we do not make any further inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.813" offset="10327219">Now in this record we have a rather strongly contested contention that public safety requires the abolition of price competition and engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.925" offset="10367656">There is a contrary view, we presented an expert witness from Secretary of Airforce who said there is no objective evidence to support this kind of view that price competition results in unsafe practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.572" offset="12626203">I think that the last colloquy illustrates the difficulty of per se rule as applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.970" offset="12655878">Mr. Shapiro did not try the case, I believe he is not thoroughly familiar with the record and his application of 10-G is simply erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.821" offset="12743232">The difficulty is that you can not take a simple rule particularly when drafted by engineers, you can not even take one drafted by lawyers, but you can take a general rule drafted by engineers and apply it without understanding the circumstances out of which it grew any more than you can take the Sherman Act and talk about the rule of reason, the per se rule, and all the rest of this, without having some idea of the interpretations made by this and other Courts and indeed the engineers had a formal body known as the Board of Ethical Review which made these interpretations and there are these interpretations and there is a body of testimony relating to this matter which makes it perfectly clear that Mr. Shapiro misinterprets Section, Policy 10-G.</text>
