            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79985">In original, number 76 filed under the original jurisdiction provisions of the Constitution by California against Texas, the motion for leave and to file a bill of complain is denied.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="20.465" offset="161801">In this case, California seeks to invoke the original and exclusive jurisdiction of this court to settle a dispute with the state of Texas over the question of which state has the power to collect death taxes from the state of the Late Howard Robard Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.100" offset="260334">The Court today without explanation of any kind evidently concludes that California's complaint does not state acclaim within our original and exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.857" offset="311325">This conclusion seems to me squarely contrary to a long standing precedent of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.146" offset="336507">In the case of Texas against Florida, reported in volume 306 of the United States Reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.422" offset="365660">That case was decided in 1939, it involved the estate of Colonel Edward Green, the son of the legendary Hetty Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.114" offset="408396">I have joined in the order denying California's motion for leave to file this complain, only because I think the case of Texas against Florida was wrongly decided and should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.974" offset="459805">My views are set out in the concurring opinion filed today which Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Stevens have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.761" offset="495018">Mr. Justice Brennan has also filed a concurring opinion and Mr. Justice Powell has also filed a separate concurring opinion.</text>
