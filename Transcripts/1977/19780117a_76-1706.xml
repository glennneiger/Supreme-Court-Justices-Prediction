            <text syncTime="22.785" offset="171119">Respondents challenged Washington's Gross Receipts Tax on Stevedoring under both the commerce clause and the import export clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.238" offset="204869">Both are relevant as the Stevedores provide services for goods, both to and from other states and to and from other nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.806" offset="243217">Since Complete Auto Transit last year, the rule is that the validity under the commerce clause are easy to state; labels attached to the tax are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.360" offset="289402">A tax is not invalid unless it discriminates against inter-state or foreign commerce, is improperly apportioned, is unrelated to any services provided by the taxing state or applies to business to which the taxing state has no substantial nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.020" offset="360037">Non of these objections can be fairly applied to this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.854" offset="379367">The import-export clause, on the other hand is both more peremptory and more narrow, but a tax may run afoul of it for reasons which would also invalidated under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.694" offset="434747">A non-discriminatory property tax against goods in transit is an example which you used in Michelin Tire.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.523" offset="466094">Such a tax of course, would also be improperly apportioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.607" offset="502352">Precisely, that is my next point was to Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.827" offset="515308">The peremptory ban of the import-export clause itself, however, is directed only against imposts and duties on imports or exports.</text>

          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="123.766" stopTime="258.261">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="123.766" offset="574972">It is a direct probation and in that sense it is more peremptory and specific than as the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.814" offset="603184">Such an impost or duty is invalid even though it meets all of our commerce clause tests, but in fact there are relatives few such levies.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.845" offset="647384">An example; if the State of Washington imposed a manufacturing tax on widgets and a compensating tax on widgets imported from Japan, the later tax might well meet all of the tests of the commerce clause, but it would still be an impost or a duty on an import.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.670" offset="726587">Another example is a tax on bills of lading, the documentary evidence of goods and commerce, and thus a tax on the goods themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.043" offset="768174">But Article 1, Section 10 does not apply to a tax which is not an impost or a duty on imports or exports.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.061" offset="804223">In Michelin Tire you found the property tax there not be an impost or a duty even though the tires might still be imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.296" offset="845183">This case we submit is easier than Michelin Tire, not only is our tax not an impost or a duty, it is not on imports or exports either.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.999" offset="891994">Canton Railroad points out that the effect of the import-export is narrower as to services related to imported goods than it is to the goods themselves and that it does not extend to transportation services consisting of handling of goods at the port, which is exactly what the respondent Stevedores do.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.703" offset="982796">Our tax is on that local service only, ignores both the goods and their value, deals with the subject which no other state can conceivably tax and is designed to defray the fair share of the costs of government provided to those who are engaged in Stevedoring service.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.587" offset="1062313">It ignores that large class of imports and exports which do not require Stevedoring services.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.894" offset="1087495">Thus it is not infringe upon any of the purposes of the import-export clause which you outlined in Michelin Tire.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.328" offset="1149248">You certainly could have decided Michelin Tire on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.613" offset="1166384">The intriguing element of the decision was that you specifically declined to do so in order to focus on import levy so I do not believe that has any significance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.341" offset="1213300">Yesterday Mr. Justice Blackmun noticed the respondent's claim that Washington's Gross Receipts Tax was not general because it did not apply to every single business occupation in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.745" offset="1270979">Under respondent's theory no property tax is general because some property is always exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.128" offset="1300445">The federal income tax is not general because some categories of income are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.083" offset="1324268">As a matter of fact we would be hard pressed to find under that theory a single general tax anywhere in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.411" offset="2585565">Atlantic Richfield's tax was invalid under your long line of decisions to the effect that a Sales tax can be levied only by the destination jurisdiction; which in that case California was not and you current law has not threatened by any means the holding of the Atlantic Richfield case and we do not challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.779" offset="2675113">One final point which is raised by these respondents is the implication that there are somehow politically powerless outsiders in a marginal business.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.844" offset="2731328">Interstate and foreign trade are vital to the economic health of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.944" offset="2755779">These private corporate respondents reside in and do business exclusively in the state and the Public Ports Association respondent represents municipal corporations, so politically powerful that they have obtained a special state constitutional exemption from property tax limitations applicable to every other governmental entity including the state itself save one.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.845" offset="2855357">In summary, Washington's Gross Receipt Tax here at issue, does not tax imports or exports at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.859" offset="2883361">In fact a large proportion of the imports and exports passing through the state are not even affected by the tax because they do not require Stevedoring services.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.996" offset="2919932">The taxes levied on the handling of goods only and not on the goods themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.841" offset="2939367">Those services are performed entirely within the state and the tax is thus precisely apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.220" offset="2964863">The does not discriminate against inter-state or foreign commerce and is fairly related to governmental services provided by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.189" offset="2996732">As Walter Helistien (Ph) says in his masterful Michigan Law Review article of last June on Complete Auto Transit and Michelin Tire and I quote ”In each case this Court's opinion can fairly be read as stressing a common doctrinal theme.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.357" offset="3057336">So long as the state does not discriminate against our importer's burden upon the constitutionally protected interest, the tax will be sustained.”</text>

            <text syncTime="780.095" offset="3200383">The respondents are Stevedoring Companies of the State of Washington and also the Washington Public Ports Association to that extent by their participation, we have one segment of the public contesting with another.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.180" offset="3260673">The respondents by the record load and unload ships between the first in-point and the last point rest on the pier or dock and the ship's hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.017" offset="3316053">We are here to defend as you know the validity of two of your decisions, the Puget Sound case decided in 1937, the Carter &amp; Weekes decided ten years later in 1947, and we invoke two clauses of the constitution, commonly called the import-export clause and the commerce clause.We see the clauses as a different in force and in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.276" offset="3429006">Until this morning it was our impression from the briefs of the state that they saw the clauses as imposing substantially the same prohibitions on the commerce; namely if your tax is okay, if it does not discriminate and if it apportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.844" offset="3499328">We hear today that the commerce or the import-export clause does have more force.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.003" offset="3523988">I must admit that I did not catch the exact point on which it had more force, but we will of course say it does not, we will try to be specific as to the additional force we think it has over the implied prohibition of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.104" offset="3592324">We start therefore, with our what might be our best foot forward, the import-export clause which does contain an express prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.464" offset="3633806">Our thesis under the import-export clause is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.149" offset="3652510">That the expressed prohibition which in paraphrase says that no state shall levy duties on imports and exports, does cover in a literal, plain meaning sense loading and unloading because we suggest two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.772" offset="3727011">Loading and unloading is in a functional sense right at the heart of the import-export process.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.473" offset="3757836">We also invoke we think a kind of approach suggested by this Court in Michelin where Michelin pointed out that the tax there, a tax on the mass of goods and the property in the state after they had come to rest was avoidable by the importer.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.785" offset="3827113">We say here that on analysis we think anyone would come to the conclusion that a tax fastened on the loading, on the unloading would not be avoidable by the importer-exporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.853" offset="3875387">That if the state were given power over that link in the process, they would have effectively power over the process as a whole.</text>

            <label>Mr. John T. Piper</label>
            <text syncTime="1048.565" offset="4274224">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.931" offset="4287704">I think the only answer I can give is that there has been a very bare bones kind of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.493" offset="4309960">It does not include such things as a wharfage, cranes, for renting cranes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.808" offset="4339217">In the Stevedore case for example, among the activities that the Stevedoring Company did was to make longshoreman available by hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.516" offset="4374012">That was not protected, although it was in aid of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.212" offset="4388850">So it is a hardcore line and I guess what we are saying here is that even a strictest definition would find the landing of the goods essential to import indeed the loading of the goods essential to the exporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.989" offset="4459903">There is a negative side to our thesis that we may to deal with also, the state it seems to us on brief at least, has attempted or suggested that they would graft on to the clause, a kind of implied limitation which would be to the effect that it was, a tax is alright if does not discriminate and it is apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.649" offset="4550600">We would resist that for reasons that I will state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.067" offset="4568259">We are not of course sure just how strongly they about that limitation after this morning, but we will deal with anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.452" offset="4593754">Returning to why we feel that were covered by the express language, the language that is actually there in the clause, I turn again to the functional idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.985" offset="4635864">If importing is bringing things into the country what can be more central to that than putting them on the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.372" offset="4669405">This court in Brown v. Maryland in fact expressly said that a tax could be as effective to control importing and exporting if it is attached at the instant of landing, as if it is attached out of the entry at the harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.787" offset="4731054">Going in the other direction, what could be more central to getting the goods out of the country exporting then getting them aboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.175" offset="4760624">Another test as I have suggested came out of your decision we think in Michelin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.700" offset="4782776">There you pointed out that the tax there could have been avoided by the importer just by keeping the goods moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.500" offset="4817989">Now, the implication of that reasoning it seems to us is if the functional that is involved here is so fundamental to the process that the importer can not avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.111" offset="4868353">It is part of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.983" offset="4875877">In another words, if you give the state a power over this link in the chain, he has power over the whole process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.272" offset="4909000">The Brown v. Maryland case is instructive there, that was the one that this court relied on principally in Michelin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.671" offset="4938675">There the tax was a license to sell and this Court reasoned that without the ability to sell the product, the active importing was useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.942" offset="4983710">So that by fastening on the ability to sell, they effectively taxed the process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.265" offset="5012967">The Omni case we have cited on brief is another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.061" offset="5024148">There, there was a tax not on the importer, but on the carrier or more precisely on the carriers in bill of lading and this Court took notice of the fact that a bill of lading is really essential to commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.150" offset="5084543">Therefore, if you fasten on that bill of lading you have fastened on the process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.176" offset="5120696">In short what we are saying is that we come under the literal express language of the clause as written that if you give the power, give the state the power to tax, this link in the process they can effectively tax the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.979" offset="5195824">Now, I come to their, what I would call to say the negative part of our thesis under this clause is there an implied limitation in the clause, that says in effect no state shall levy duty on imports except that the state may do so if the tax is unapportioned and non discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.166" offset="5292582">The clause as you know has one express exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.216" offset="5308778">A state may tax in order to enforce or execute its inspection laws, but there is an imperative in that exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.799" offset="5339184">It says, it may tax to the extent absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.769" offset="5359037">So we are faced then with just one exception that is express and a rather stringently restricted exception at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.104" offset="5388399">May you graft on, should this Court graft on to the express clause, an implied limitation that a tax is okay if it is unapportioned and non discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.943" offset="5443674">Now, despite counsel's statement this morning that the import-export clause does have more force, we have not in our minds at least detected, what force it would have beyond approving the taxes that are non discriminatory and apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.993" offset="5511906">Certainly there is no suggestion in their brief as to just why a tax would be struck down if it could meet those two requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.803" offset="5555165">We give you three exceptions that we take to the idea that there is some limitation here in the nature of taxes are okay if they are non discriminatory and apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.351" offset="5601349">Your decision in Richfield has dealt with this question at length, very carefully taken into account the history of the constitution, the standards by which the constitution should be expounded, I m not going to repeat it because we dealt with it at length in our brief at pages 11 and 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.409" offset="5677627">I want to go to my second exception to the idea that we can impliedly limit this clause to the purposes of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.882" offset="5715452">Counsel yesterday stated correctly that this Court in Michelin identified three purposes of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.280" offset="5749098">One of the purposes we discussed on brief which is the prevention of the transit fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.056" offset="5776161">Michelin said that the clause was fashioned to prevent transit fees and the experience under the articles of the confederation had taught that seaboard states were inclined to fasten on these transit fees on goods flowing to the inland states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.966" offset="5847841">Throughout the decision in Michelin, there are repeated careful distinctions of the transit situation from the tax on the mass of the property involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.154" offset="5888592">For example, the holding of this Court in Michelin, stated in the last paragraph of the opinion begins, petitioner's tires in this case were no longer in transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.198" offset="5932791">There is at page 290 of the Michelin opinion a statement or I think a very suggestion, I am going to put it that way, that even a non discriminatory property tax might have to exclude or would have to exclude goods in transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.212" offset="6004784">So we think that the transit idea has been carefully set aside and preserved in the Michelin decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.545" offset="6034146">Now, the state wants to do exactly what that purpose was intended to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.166" offset="6056611">They want to have a transit fee, now to be sure it is a sanitized transit fee because it is non discriminatory and apportioned, but it is a transit fee nonetheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.213" offset="6100811">It enlarges their tax base by the increased volume of traffic at the expense of the inland states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.264" offset="6132993">I address myself now to the other two purposes that you identified in Michelin that underly this clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.527" offset="6158071">We did not address them as counsel correctly pointed out on brief, but I do now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.320" offset="6181268">The federal government wished to avoid having the states share with it the revenues and the power of regulation over foreign commerce, and we say that the state's brief asserts the power to do exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.543" offset="6246156">They say at page 32 in a title, a state may consistent with the import-export clause impose a tax on the act or privilege of engaging in the business of transporting goods, moving in foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.561" offset="6306237">Now, that business would include the business of the foreign carriers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.529" offset="6322120">Stevedoring or loading and unloading is the issue here, but the business of transporting goods, moving in foreign commerce, that is a business that the foreign carriers are engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.516" offset="6369976">Suppose for example that they asserted that tax and the foreign carriers perhaps not being accustomed to that treatment, resisted payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.445" offset="6413757">(Inaudible) collection officers presumably would take the most practical means of collection mainly seizing the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.168" offset="6436641">That would have I think some impact on foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.700" offset="6454717">Again, on the regulation point, if the power to tax is the power to regulate, this Court has as we pointed on on brief, previously said that our state, which is the Dairy State may tax all your margin, this was in 1930s, without violating the rules against discrimination, which are very loose, we say rather feeble rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.184" offset="6544683">Well, why could not they, if they were granted the power they ask here to tax handling or tax loading and unloading, why could not they discriminate between what is being unloaded and loaded like discriminate against Olio, against South American Beef.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.881" offset="6611452">Why could not they in other words use a power to tax loading and unloading to erect their own tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.429" offset="6637679">Now, this is speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.788" offset="6643113">I guess the point we would say is that the speculation or the concerns expressed here were considered by the framers of the Constitution and it is not we suggest appropriate for them to be second guessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.627" offset="6702463">Those are the purposes that the framers thought merited this expressed prohibition and we suggest that they should be accepted and the language should be applied as it was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.539" offset="6770068">I come to the last reason why we accepted the idea that there is some implied limitation here and it comes back again to the idea that we think there surely must be more force in an expressed clause than in an implied one, and therefore, whatever you may decide is the rule in the Commerce Clause and we of course assert that the Commerce Clause has a stronger prohibition than the state does, but whatever you may decide surely there is some additional strength or force in effect in the import-export clause than you would find in the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.459" offset="6929833">In connection with this question about the greater force of the import-export clause, let me mention the Canton Railroad case discussed by counsel yesterday as being the case in which impliedly overruled the Stevedoring cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.906" offset="6987615">That was a case written by Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.053" offset="7000154">Now, the language of that opinion and its companion did in fact consisted the word 'handling,' but if you look at the facts carefully, a handling covers things that are (Inaudible) loading and unloading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.920" offset="7055638">It covered storage, wharfage, weighing of loaded freight cars, furnishing a crane, these are the peripheral sort of things Mr. Chief Justice that as I said in tradition just have not received the protection, apparently not being close enough to the core, this was in fact a distinction made in the first Stevedore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.283" offset="7137036">Perhaps the closest thing to transportation there was switching of cars from one point in Baltimore, that is from the piers to the trunk line of railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.071" offset="7180190">Mr. Justice Douglas said, that was more remote than Stevedoring and he distinguished the Stevedoring case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.103" offset="7204327">At least you think that, that was a mere perfunctory distinguishment that Mr. Justice Douglas made, I call your attention to the fact that Mr. Justice Douglas participated in the second Stevedore case in 1946, just four years before Canton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.551" offset="7266185">And there he voted to strike, to sustain the tax under the Commerce Clause, but under the import-export clause he switched over to the majority and was joined by one other justice, so there was a 7-2 decision there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.202" offset="7316758">And he said to him, the express prohibition of the import-export clause made the difference and again it was Mr. Justice Douglas who wrote the Richfield opinion which said, lack of discrimination is not enough to save a tax that applies to import-exports.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.364" offset="12537382">If that service of unloading were engaged in Washington, this is what you decided in Canton Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.014" offset="12560056">You looked to the import export clause -- You the Supreme Court of the United States looked to the import export clause and said now this clause may have a great breadth when the tax is on the imports or exports themselves, at that time you might very well have extended it as far as Michelin Tire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.871" offset="12639468">In any event, you extended it until the imports were out of their original packages wherever they eventually left, but even back in the 1950 in Canton Railroad, you said the clause is much narrower when it is applied to services related to goods, specifically in that case to handling services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.289" offset="12725150">Those handling services were an integral part of the transportation of the goods, absolutely integral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.939" offset="12747720">They could not, the imports could not get into the United States without getting off those ships and without being transported to the truck line and railroads and then the Western Maryland transported by the rails, could not have done it at all, nonetheless you said it does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.992" offset="12811877">Why did it not apply because it was not a tax against the goods or services.</text>
