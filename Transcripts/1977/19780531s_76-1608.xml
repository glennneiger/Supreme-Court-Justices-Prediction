            <text syncTime="9.784" offset="119062">This case is here by reason of the grant of a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.697" offset="154693">The respondents, Loren Tyler and Robert Tompkins were convicted in a Michigan trial court of conspiracy to burn real property in violation of a state criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.971" offset="207774">Various pieces of physical evidence and testimony based on personal observation all obtained through un-consented and warrantless earaches and entries by police and fire officials onto the burned premises were admitted into evidence at the respondents' trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.197" offset="288754">On appeal the Michigan Supreme Court reversed the convictions, holding that the warrantless searches were unconstitutional and that the evidence obtained was therefore inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.274" offset="337028">We granted certiorari to consider the applicability of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to official entries onto fire damaged premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.323" offset="393243">For the reasons set out in the written opinion of the Court, filed with the clerk this morning, we hold that an entry into a building to fight a fire requires no warrant and that once in the building, officials may remain there for a reasonable time to investigate the cause of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.162" offset="472551">Thereafter, additional entries to investigate the cause of the fire must be made pursuant to the warrant procedures governing administrative searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.916" offset="515601">Evidence of arson discovered in the course of these investigations is admissible at trial, but if the investigating officials find the probable cause to believe arson has occurred and require further access to gather evidence for a possible prosecution, they may obtain a warrant only upon a traditional showing of probable cause applicable to searches for evidence of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.226" offset="624793">These principles require that we affirm the judgment of the Michigan Supreme Court, ordering a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.236" offset="652901">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a separate statement joining the judgment and most of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.312" offset="677142">Mr. Justice White joined by Mr. Justice Marshall has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.705" offset="706713">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.164" offset="728551">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
