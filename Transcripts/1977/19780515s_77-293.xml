            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79995">In the other case, Kulko against the California Superior Court and this case was initially filed as an appeal from the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.925" offset="127642">We postponed probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.326" offset="141226">In this case, the appellant married  appellee in California in 1959 while on a brief military stop over.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.479" offset="181873">Both's bosses were New York domiciliaries at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.309" offset="201203">Following the appellant's return from military service, the couple resided together in New York, where their two children were born.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.673" offset="238611">They separated in 1972 and executed a separation agreement in New York, providing that the children would spend the school year in New York with the appellant and their vacations in California with the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.520" offset="306006">In December of 1973, appellant's daughter decided that she wanted to spend the school year in California with the mother and appellant does send her to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.639" offset="346548">With this Act that the California court believed, wanted the exercise of in person on jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.027" offset="380090">In our opinion filed with the clerk today, we dismiss the appeal, grant certiorari and reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.711" offset="406839">The due process clause prohibits the state to exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant only where there are minimum contacts between the defendant and the State that makes it very unreasonable to require him to the defend an action in that State's Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.763" offset="490953">The mere act of acquiescing in the child desire to spend more time with her mother is simply not sufficient to meet the standard where the defendant has no other relevant contacts that the forum stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.645" offset="550513">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Powell joined.</text>
