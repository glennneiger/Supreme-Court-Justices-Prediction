            <label>Mr. George E. Fruechtenicht</label>
            <text syncTime="132.232" offset="608906">That is correct your honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.581" offset="614235">The issue, the principal issue is what is a Doctrine of Judicial Immunity should be applied to and approval signed by Judge Stump of a petition filed by the mother and sole guardian of the 15 year old girl to have surgery performed upon her ,that surgery was a tubal ligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.317" offset="709217">The larger issue I would submit to this Court would be whether the doctrine of judicial immunity should be permitted to be, in my view, diluted and altered by the pronouncements of the opinion of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.544" offset="790092">The context in which the matter was presented or is has presented, the factual background, so, far as the Judge is concerned is as follows: the mother Ora McFarlin, determined that apparently because of facts set out in a petition, her daughter 15-years old should have tubal ligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.340" offset="889252">The petition speaks for itself, it set forth in the brief of the respondents along with the approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.292" offset="917047">Briefly, it suggests or alleges under oath that the daughter is sexually promiscuous that she has been uncontrollable, that the mother is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.743" offset="966888">Obviously, that the daughter is going to become pregnant and that for the best interest of the child, she asks that the Court approve a petition by the mother to have tubal ligation performed upon her.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.627" offset="1022477">When that petition was presented to the Court by the mother and her attorney, the Court then was required to make a primary threshold decision and that was whether or not he had jurisdiction to approve that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.380" offset="1109412">I submit to the Court and made this decision as Courts of General Jurisdiction in every county, every day throughout this country must make in matters of this particular type.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.429" offset="7573674">Your Honors, I believe that the questioning today indicates what is truly the crux today and that is that the probably the Doctrine of Judicial Immunity need not come in to play in your decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.198" offset="7632710">The question ask by Mr. Justice Powell was this not merely administrative act as discuss in ex parte Virginia and non judicial act as discussed in several lower Court, federal Court cases probably is going to be the correct and the logical determining decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.897" offset="7735528">The consent statute which authorized the parent to consent to surgery of a minor child clearly can be read only in the terms of common sense, necessary surgery.Certainly sterilization on a petition as filed by the mother in this instance, is not necessary surgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.322" offset="7829256">There is a long line of cases which has developed on the kidney transplant cases, for example, that a parent just does not have the power to consent to non therapeutic, none beneficial surgery.</text>

            <text syncTime="1968.800" offset="7955166">If the case had been properly presented as in A.L. vs G.R.H., the case was filed with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.530" offset="7986095">The Guardian ad Litem was appointed to represent Linda, if attorneys brief and prepared arguments on each side and the Court made a determination that we will allow sterilization under Indiana and common law as it exists today, then I would say in that instance your Honor that the Judge made a mistake but his is entitled to immunity for his action because he had subject matter and I honestly also believe personal jurisdiction is required.</text>
