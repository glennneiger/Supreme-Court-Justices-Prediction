            <text syncTime="61.240" offset="244924">I am Richard Oseran here on behalf of the petitioner, Rufus Mincey.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.860" offset="263419">This case concerns the trial court's admission in Arizona Supreme Court's affirmation of what the petitioner contends to be unlawfully seized evidence in an inadmissible statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.478" offset="313887">The first question before this Court is whether there is a compelling need to permit a warrantless general search at the scene of certain suspected crimes specifically a possible homicide or crime involving a serious bodily injury, where there is no exigency and there is ample time to obtain a warrant without frustrating the purpose of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.613" offset="410436">The second question concerns whether a statement made by the petitioner in the intensive care unit of a hospital in violation of Miranda was involuntary or untrustworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.337" offset="461322">And if neither, whether his testimony at trial was perjurious to render his statement admissible for any purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.206" offset="600816">The -- one of the counts was sale and if the -- you ruled for me on the first question would be the unlawful search under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.148" offset="632581">That would suppress narcotics that were seized but there doesn't have to be narcotics for the crime of offer to sell or sell to be -- to have been committed and therefore, the second question would still be an issue in the second trial on that charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.418" offset="765597">It affected his credibility before the jury and his credibility is intertwined between all of the counts as to what there opinion is of his truthfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.559" offset="810214">And at least in one of those instances, it was -- involved the direct comment on his silence which again goes to his credibility which was a factor that may well have been before jury and its decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.371" offset="909479">I agree -- I would agree with that, but I think the question of the voluntariness of the statements are part of the -- the drug convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.945" offset="943752">I will initially confine the facts and argument to the first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.665" offset="970606">On October 28, 1974, nine undercover, disguised police officers and a county attorney forced entry into the petitioner's residence by means of ruse.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.540" offset="1026090">The armed plainclothed officer, the first one and ran straight back to the bedroom where the petitioner was and where his girlfriend lay sleeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.834" offset="1071334">Gun fire erupted immediately leaving four people seriously wounded; the petitioner, the girlfriend, the disguised officer, and one occupant of the apartment that was struck by a bullet that came out from the wall of the bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.902" offset="1135595">The entire incident transpired and was completed within a matter of seconds of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.310" offset="1161195">The scene was secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.580" offset="1166315">There was no search or no seizure at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.774" offset="1183033">The wounded were transported to the hospital and investigating officers arrived and conducted a search that lasted for four days without the benefit of warrant and they seized between two and 300 items.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.373" offset="1253460">The Fourth Amendment prescribes warrantless searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.065" offset="1268193">This Court has continually held that warrantless searches are per se unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.095" offset="1288359">Necessity compels certain exceptions but there was no necessity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.828" offset="1307272">An immediate search was not imperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.417" offset="1317616">The residents had been secured prior to the commencement of the exhaustive search and the purpose of the search would not have been frustrated by the officers attempting to obtain a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.547" offset="5438171">Today, I'd like to divide my argument up into two segments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.156" offset="5452591">The first argument I'd like to deal with is the issue of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.493" offset="5469936">And to begin with, I think it's extremely important to look at some of the facts that were present there at the apartment back in October 28th of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.565" offset="5514240">The officers, to begin with were lawfully inside the petitioner's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.022" offset="5540049">One of their member, Mr. Headricks, had just been into the apartment and had observed heroine in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.194" offset="5568679">The petitioner had showed him heroin and offered to sell it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.048" offset="5584144">The officer, Officer Headrick said that he wanted to purchase the -- the heroin and that he was going to go outside to his money man to get the money and come back and purchase the heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.934" offset="5635657">Officer Headricks left the apartment, walked out to the parking lot, saw a -- Detective Schwartz, all this time, what had been transpiring in the apartment had been broadcast to the other police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.968" offset="5683827">He was telling him, “I've seen the heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.107" offset="5692395">I've ran the test.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.532" offset="5698038">And the detective who was in-charge, Lieutenant Fuller said, “Everybody, meet up here at apartment 211 for this raid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.448" offset="5733773">So they went back up to the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.258" offset="5744953">The officer, Officer Headricks, knocked on the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.334" offset="5765329">There was his friend, Detective Schwartz, was standing to his left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.611" offset="5782361">The door was opened by Hodgman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.438" offset="5789675">As the door was opened, Headricks said something with the word police in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.122" offset="5816424">The door was opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.729" offset="5818828">He started in, Hodgman pushed the door shut and Headricks burst on in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.711" offset="5846831">Schwartz had his shoulder in the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.765" offset="5854981">There was a testimony that he at that time said police, police officer or something of this nature and then Schwartz and Lieutenant Fuller, who was behind him, got into the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.599" offset="5894374">By this time, Officer Headricks was into the bedroom where the shooting took place and that about this time, the shooting does, in fact, take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.398" offset="5933558">Lieutenant Fulller looks up into the hallway of this small apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.686" offset="5950694">This is not a real large apartment here that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.315" offset="5961247">This is just a small one-bedroom apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.701" offset="5970756">He looks up in the hallway which to the left would be the bathroom and to the right would be the bedroom and he sees Ferguson there in the hallway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.382" offset="6005447">He goes up to Ferguson, puts him up against the door, up against the wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.582" offset="6022269">About this time the bullets start to -- to fly into the -- from bedroom, the shots begin and within a matter of seconds the shooting is all over with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.317" offset="6065215">When the shooting is over with, Detective Headricks comes out of the bedroom and falls down, goes down in the hallway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.329" offset="6101264">He says, “I'm down,” or something of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.730" offset="6110877">The other policemen go into the bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.220" offset="6120803">Two of them go in and they see the petitioner behind the bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.897" offset="6135536">Then, the other agency has called, that is homicide is called and the area is secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.036" offset="6164062">Now, this is what faced Officer Renya when came to the apartment back in that time in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.070" offset="6192274">He came into a bullet-ridden apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.944" offset="6199693">There were bullet holes in the wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.981" offset="6207843">There was blood on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.879" offset="6215471">There was broken glass from the Acardia door that was in the living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.614" offset="6230413">It was on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.976" offset="6235847">There were guns on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.607" offset="6242325">There was some blood on the wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.607" offset="6254341">There was -- you had wounded people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.305" offset="6261133">You had Officer Headricks who was being removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.958" offset="6271791">You had a -- this Charles Ferguson here, he had been shot in the head and he was lying in the hallway like -- and his blood was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.442" offset="6305750">You had a wounded girl who was in the bedroom closet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.209" offset="6328738">She was in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.871" offset="6331455">She had been shot at least twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.532" offset="6342113">The police officer testified in the forearm and in the hip.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.568" offset="6354233">I believe the doctor later testified at trial that she had a -- an injury in the area colon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.451" offset="6377744">So you had all of these serious injured people there including the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.991" offset="6395925">So without a search warrant, and pursuant to the policy that was followed by the Tucson Police Department, Officer Renya, eight minutes after the shooting took place began an immediate investigation of the premises -- search of the premises if you have it, to determine what had happened there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.740" offset="6474919">The State recognizes that this Court is held on many occasions that -- you know, you've got to get a search warrant before you can go in and have a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.774" offset="6506998">That it's unreasonable if you don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.925" offset="6515670">But this Court has also recognized that there are exceptions, such as border searches, stop-and-frisk, exigent circumstances with flinging out those items that are in plain view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.199" offset="6560705">What I'm asking you do -- to do here today, is to make the Arizona “murder scene exception” another exception to the Fourth Amendment which requires the obtaining of a search warrant prior to conducting a search.</text>
