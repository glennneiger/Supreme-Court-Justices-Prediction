            <text syncTime="33.622" offset="214462">The minimization provision of title three and on Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act 1968 provides that every order and extension thereof authorizing an electronic surveillance shall contain the provision that the authorization to intercept shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of communication not otherwise subject to interception under this Chapter.</text>

            <text syncTime="61.456" offset="325744">I think the court requested counsel to address the problem of standing, is that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. John A. Shorter, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="69.109" offset="356360">Yes there are three questions really before the court in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.718" offset="390841">First one, is the meaning and interpretation and and construction of the minimization provision of Federal Wiretap statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.460" offset="433786">We feel that specifically question is whether the court below determined the correct standard and properly applied to conduct of the wiretap in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.272" offset="472970">Related questions also implicated, one is as the scope of the remedy to be applied in the event of a violation of minimization requirement and that is whether full or partial suppression of the fruits of the wiretap to be mandated and thirdly whether the petition has got standing to assert the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.768" offset="567011">The standing question that relates only to the petition of Scott within the framework of the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.338" offset="605254">There is a related petition for writ of cert also arising from the Circuit court of opinion in this case and that is the petition for Chloe V. Daviage and of course per situation on the question of standing is same as that of the petition of Scott.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.610" offset="690413">Question of standing was fully briefed in this Miss Daviage's petition in her brief as amicus and we of course have fully researched in brief, the point of standing in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.382" offset="773483">I would say that in suffice standing, we think that the question was adequately and correctly answered by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in the Balosi (ph) case which was also an appeal from a wiretap ruling of the District Court and similarly in the earlier opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case referred to as Scott 1, the direct appeal in this case is from what is referred to through out the briefs of the parties as Scott 2 but in Scott 1 the Circuit court fully addressed the question standing and it determined that under the Court’s interpretation of the related provisions of Title 3, the petitioner Scott clearly had standing to assert the violation of the minimization requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.983" offset="1027915">We feel that was the correct analysis of the court’s analysis of the question was a correct one and certainly the court’s conclusion of we feel was amply justified by the language of the statue which identifies a grieved person whose as one whose conversations are intercepted over the Wiretap and secondly one against whom the interception is directed, on both questions, on both points the petitioner Scott qualifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.887" offset="1159468">The petitioner Scott was identified in the application for the wiretap, that is the affidavit of The Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drug agent who applied for the wiretap as being one of the principal targets.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.013" offset="1228013">Though the order that was entered by the court in response to this application did not identify Scott particularly as one of the subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.682" offset="1266675">The order said that the targets of the investigation that the wiretap was authorized to intercept the conversation of Bernis Thurmon, Alfonso Lee and others, and of course, for one to determine who the others might be and so far as what the record would show at that point, there were nine persons identified in the application, it being the principal offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.264" offset="1377016">Scott was certainly a principal target of the investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.933" offset="1595713">We feel that the question of minimization is related to a number of factors, the least one of which we would urge would be the percentage of narcotic related calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.974" offset="1639808">For instance, it would seriously relate to who it is who might use the phone, whether or not that has been developed over the course of the Wiretap, a pattern of clearly innocent calls between certain people who talk on the phone and--</text>

            <label>Mr. John A. Shorter, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="430.782" offset="1803021">What we relied on was the testimony of the agent who supervised the Wiretap that the perception of the agents who were listening to the wiretap and the reports that were made to him and reports that he in turn forwarded to the Attorney in charge of the Wiretap that roughly 40% of the calls were narcotic related, this was his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.314" offset="1917228">The motion to suppress hearing that was held in the District Court in April of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.384" offset="1945440">Judge Widey (ph) , the judge who presided at that particular hearing adopted that finding and as a matter of fact, he made it the basis of the ruling that he ultimately entered suppressing the Wiretap that though there was testimony that 40% of the calls were narcotic related, 60% of the calls were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.551" offset="2050139">There was no effort, absolutely no effort made on the part of any of the agents conducting the wiretap to minimize the interception of any telephone call.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="505.578" stopTime="520.897">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="505.578" offset="2102280">How would you go about minimizing that Mr. Shorter, once you have found that 40% were clearly narcotics related, 39% were so ambiguous they could not tell and how do you minimize from there on?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_a_shorter" startTime="520.897" stopTime="687.736">
            <label>Mr. John A. Shorter, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="520.897" offset="2163511">Well, when we say that some of the calls were so ambiguous that they could not be -- that you could not tell what they related to, we think that is the determination that was made by Mr. Kellogg, our adversary indicates, the agents who compiled daily records and reports of the calls that were being made over the telephone, using their own judgment, using their own instincts referring to the logs of the calls that they created at the time that the calls were made, passing the information along to Mr. Cooper, the supervising agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.433" offset="2313662">Mr. Cooper was reviewing their logs, he was reviewing their reports and as the reports were going in, some days would be three out of six calls were narcotic related, some days would be 3 out of 19 calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.483" offset="2365907">So that at the end when we totaled up the number of calls that were intercepted and incidentally all the calls on this particular telephone were intercepted over 30 day period, with no effort, with no phone call ever being not recorded and not heard by the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.282" offset="2457022">When you got to the end of the line, there was some compilation that Mr. Cooper testified to and that was that well our conclusion was if 40% of the calls were narcotic related that was not the issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.496" offset="2525881">It was not the matter of percentages although percentages were important because a majority of the calls were not related according to the judgment of the agents to the narcotic enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.349" offset="2573320">They were not narcotic related conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.523" offset="2586067">Now, there were instances of calls being made over the phone which were challenged in the district court as being subject to some reasonable effort at minimization and the statute that we are talking about we submit, it creates an affirmative duty on the part of the agents to conduct the wiretap and this is the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.766" offset="2699021">To conduct the wiretap in a way as to minimize the interception of calls not related to the criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.126" offset="2740399">And in fact that is what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.228" offset="2748862">So the statute creates a responsibility on the United States Attorney or the assistant who is supervising the tap, the supervising agent and the agents who are actually doing the intercept.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.087" offset="2816258">But even above that it creates a responsibility.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="687.736" offset="2830887">Mr. Shorter, the statute does not say, that you have to eliminate calls not related to criminal enterprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="895.006" offset="3659909">When the mother said Geneva has something very important to tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.223" offset="3680807">This is another conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.033" offset="3684046">This does not have anything to do with this conversation about Bernis, taking care of business which is what Geneva said to her Mother, when her mother said, well where is Bernis.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.818" offset="3719155">This is her common law husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.308" offset="3725215">This is just like any mother in law would say well where is your husband, when he's out, taking care of business whatever that maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.783" offset="3747053">But that is not a narcotic related conversation and the conversation that you are now referring to was a later conversation where the mother was saying to Geneva, there is something important that I want to say to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.121" offset="3800448">All the conversations are deeply personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.527" offset="3814031">This is a mother talking to her daughter, urging her daughter to leave the man that she's living with, bring you close and as a conversation go on they become, the personal nature of them is quite obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.972" offset="3867844">The mother says to Geneva, there is something I want to talk to you about.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.060" offset="3892190">Now who knows what it is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.022" offset="3903997">I would submit that was something personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.235" offset="3912879">And Geneva said, well what is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.207" offset="3920715">The mother said, well it is something about business and I do not want to talk about business over telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.252" offset="3944957">Agent Cooper during the first hearing admitted that the agents had no reason to believe, no suspicion that the mother was involved in any narcotics related activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.821" offset="3995217">Well, this was clearly what it obviously was a mother talking to her daughter, having battering types of conversations about family matters and other personal matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.136" offset="4040461">Later, in the hearing that took place a couple of years later, after the Court of Appeals had reversed Judge Widey for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.006" offset="4075987">His testimony took a slightly different view, and that was that after reading the transcript of the seven Geneva-Mother telephone calls, he believes that there was a basis for a suspicion that the mother knew something about the narcotic enterprise, which I would submit is not a basis to intercept conversations between even a person accused of crime, the mother, which is what it amounted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.154" offset="4200539">There was a call that Geneva made to the abortion clinic, or I believe it was an abortion clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.363" offset="4229378">The agents justified intercepting that call because they did not know who she was going to talk to when she called there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.141" offset="4260516">It did not occur to them perhaps that this might be a strictly confidential personal medical matter but they intercepted the call and they justified it on the grounds, that well she might have been calling over there, making some inquiry about some narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.076" offset="4312239">The pattern of the calls in this transcript were Geneva Jenkins did not call people about narcotics, to place orders for narcotics or solicit customers for narcotics, she received calls that were made to the phone for her husband, that was the pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.012" offset="4391964">The clear pattern in this case, after examining the transcripts was that there were certain periods during the day, particularly at night, I believe from midnight until 6 in the morning, when I think there were over the 30 day period, there might have been an average of maybe one call per day from those particular hours and the question was put to the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.461" offset="4485796">Well, did you not consider cutting off the wiretap, minimizing the intrusion at least during the night time period, and it never occurred to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.115" offset="4520382">Another thing that was pointed out, every call that was made from that phone, whether it be for time, whether Mr. Thurmon wanted to know what time of the day it was, what the weather was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.632" offset="4570433">These calls were without any qualification totally intercepted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.336" offset="4709300">Right and there came a time and they also testified to it where after listening to the calls between Bernis and some of the other alleged co-conspirators, they got to know the code that these individuals were using fairly well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.445" offset="4761754">Like one of the guys would always call and say, well put me on 3rd St. or put me on 4th St. Meet me on 5th St. He has always used a numerical reference to a street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.806" offset="4803132">He was not raising for any meeting at 5th St. he was telling Bernis that he wanted 5 units of narcotics.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.906" offset="4879514">Right, I would agree that that is so but these people using this telephone were wedded to their endemic language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.304" offset="4925176">Most of the agents in this case has participated in an earlier wiretap that had occurred in the District of Columbia during the the summer, the proceeding summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.783" offset="4967076">So they were familiar with street language in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.526" offset="4982018">They were also familiar by reason of having tapped to telephone involving some Spanish speaking people, within the year proceeding --utilized in this tab that what the codes were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.860" offset="5043354">There was no problem about identifying the language and the codes that were used by the people in this case and that of course is not what argument about minimization deals with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.311" offset="5101137">We say this that when a person became identified as an alleged co-conspirators, and first of all we have to remember of the scope of the operation that this wire tap reveal despite what was set forth in the affidavit, the operation in this case was a retail distribution set up and when I say a retail, it was purely a local distribution by one person and two lieutenants, small units of narcotics, people who would either resell or use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.893" offset="5251497">In this case it became very questionable because some of the people who were ultimately charged were drug users and they bought in small amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.993" offset="5299876">That was the scope of the enterprise in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.083" offset="5312311">And after a period of time, the same people were calling day in and day out ordering small quantities of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.328" offset="5345225">The government had every justification in intercepting calls between the people who were identified as ordering narcotics over the telephone and there were justified in intercepting the conversations of new people until such time as they would get some understanding of what these people might be calling about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.843" offset="5451282">What we complain about, its clearly set forth, that in the management of this wire tap the supervision was not precise, it was not correct, though there were --</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.397" offset="6965548">The law requires it and the law requires that the government agents, formulate some reasonable approach to the wiretapping that they were about to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.099" offset="7012360">And that means in this particular case, some analysis and early analysis of the telephone calls between Geneva and her mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.784" offset="7059066">And particularly other phone calls between Geneva and people that you were talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.452" offset="7081741">There is an instance where she had a conversation with I believe is the woman called Gloria's mother, clearly a very banal conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.211" offset="7120820">But the transcript of this case reflects that when Agent Cooper was asked about whether any thought was given to minimizing, that is reducing the interception of the calls between Geneva and her mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.311" offset="7181215">His answer was well, he was asked to articulate it in terms of the guidelines, this attorney client guideline, he said, well the guidelines that we receive and as we apply them to the case, did not have anything to do with frivolous conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.154" offset="7260523">It dealt with the attorney client conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.799" offset="7271076">So his answer in effect was that, whatever Geneva and her mother were talking about that was frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.673" offset="7294586">So, it is alright if we intercept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.751" offset="7310887">Our guidelines concerned itself with attorney client relationships, doctor-patient and that kind of conversation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.773" offset="7443066">Mr. Shorter today is engaged in the discussion of the ticket or interceptions in this case that has not reflected in either of the briefs in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.023" offset="7492072">But in any event, Mr. Shorter has suggested, it seemed to me in his argument, a standard of what the government should have done to reflect exactly what the government did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.198" offset="7544735">As I understood his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.289" offset="7553094">He said that when you have a converse, when you are listening to a conversation which involves a known party to the conspiracy, the government has reason to listen to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.074" offset="7596248">And he went on to say and by the way would emphasize the record in this case reflects that every conversation that was intercepted, one of the parties to the conversation was either petitioner Thurmon or his girlfriend Geneva Jenkins who was the co-defendant in this case and now both known conspirators, participants in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.544" offset="7674093">Mr. Shorter went on to suggest that indeed when a conversation takes place between a known participant and a stranger to the agents, it is reasonable for the agents to listen to that conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.769" offset="7726965">Now, it seems to me that if you want to get into an analysis of each particular calls, that concession would cover about 95% of them including the calls he mentioned in his argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2254.280" offset="9097035">That is right, that seems to us that that is something an agent can reasonably take in to account, but in any event, in this case, the agents from the beginning knew that petitioner Thurmon was the target of the tap and after a few days they knew that his girlfriend was taking orders on phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.798" offset="9171119">The principal issue in this case as we have been discussing is whether the agents violated the minimization requirements in Judge Smith's orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.084" offset="9200271">Now, as I understand petitioner's arguments, the argument is essentially as follows that the minimization requirement of the statute imposes a two pronged test, both of which must be met for any interception is lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.974" offset="9259831">The first prong is according to the petitioners that the agents engaged in what they call good-faith efforts at minimization and the second prong is that the interceptions be objectively reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.468" offset="9321793">Although they also assert that the interceptions in this case were not objectively reasonable, they have relied almost exclusively on the argument that there were no good-faith efforts in this case to minimize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.987" offset="9367873">Our response to their argument about good faith efforts is two-fold, we have two independent responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.893" offset="9395458">Our first position is a legal position, that the alleged good-faith or the lack of good-faith, subjected good-faith of the agents conducting an interception is not a determining factor in deciding whether they have complied with a statute and the minimization orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.187" offset="9476647">Our second position is a factual position and that is that the record in this case simply does not support the claim that the agents in this case had bad faith or subjectively intended to violate the provisions of Judge Smith's orders including the minimization provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.236" offset="9560866">Now, the first issue which is legal issue has importance beyond the facts of this case and should be discussed first if not principally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.263" offset="9600990">Legal question as I suggested to Mr. Justice Marshall, seems to us can best be put in focus by considering the simplest case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.827" offset="9635262">You have agents who obtain a court order to intercept conversations based on probable cause, the John Smith, the owner of the telephone, the subscriber to the telephone is engaging in his narcotics business over that telephone and they obtain a court order not the court order provides pursuant to the statute that the interception should be conducted in such a way as to minimize the interception of conversations not otherwise subject of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.368" offset="9753440">The order said is for five days and during that period there is one call that comes over the phone and that is a call from John Smith and he starts right off talking about his narcotics business and they listen to it and they intercept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.068" offset="9808193">Now, suppose later on there is a suppression hearing and agent testifies that his supervisor instructed him to listen to everything that came over the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.557" offset="9846123">Now, as I understand the petitioner's position, they would contend that the interception of that call which we would submit is clearly reasonable, is nevertheless unlawful because the agent who intercepted it would probably have intercepted some other call that was never made in different circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.816" offset="9927207">Now, it is our position, that is our central position that there is simply no basis in the statute or in general principles of search and seizure law for that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.475" offset="9965868">We can not see any basis for arguing that that agent in my example failed in the words of the statute, “To minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.842" offset="11663305">Well, some of the judges on the Court of Appeals and the Mr. Justice Brennen and Mr. Justice Marshall have expressed concern that if our position concerning that the proper standards should be objective reasonableness were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.125" offset="11760480">There would be a danger that interceptions would then be validated by what they turn up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.338" offset="11785244">We submit that there is -- that that concern is certainly understandable, but that it does not accurately reflect our position or the analysis the Court of Appeals engaged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.964" offset="11831742">It does not reflect our position because as I was stating to Mr. Justice Stevens, our position is simply that the reasonableness of interceptions has to be based on what is going on at that time and that if it is unreasonable for an agent to listen to conversations in view of what he is – although the inputs, sensory inputs on him, then if by chance, it turns up evidence is our position that that evidence should be suppressed and that essentially is the analysis of the Court of Appeals engaged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.995" offset="11983880">Essentially, it is no different than any analysis where the courts try to decide for example, whether a policeman was justified in arresting someone or stopping and frisking someone on the basis of circumstances at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.251" offset="12124941">Apart from our legal position, our factual response to the petitioner's claim about lack of good-faith efforts is that the record simply does not support the claim of the agents here acted in bad-faith or intended to ignore their minimization obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.453" offset="12189724">We have cited in our brief the testimony of agent Cooper to the effect that he was aware of the minimization requirements that he instructed his agents with respect to them, that he never instructed his agents to listen to every call, and if they had heard the cause it appeared to be unlikely to relate to the investigation, they would have turned them him off and I would not burden the court with recitations to this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.227" offset="12292856">But I would only point out that the petitioner's claim to the contrary and the District Court's finding to the contrary is based on logical fallacy that it is based on testimony that does not logically support the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.470" offset="12353773">For example, again to take the simple example of the case where over the period of intercept, only one conversation is intercepted and it happens to be reasonable to intercept it because it is clearly crime related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.141" offset="12416467">Suppose the agent in that case at a suppression hearing had been asked repeatedly as agent Cooper was asked in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.834" offset="12443217">Well, did you ever make any efforts to minimize the interception of conversations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.864" offset="12463383">Did you ever consider your minimization obligations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.088" offset="12476235">Can you point to any instance in which you exercised discretion that resulted in the non recordation as discretionary matter as to what was overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.149" offset="12512493">If the agent in my example had given negative answers to that question, that would not reflect that was operating in bad faith, it would only reflect that he intercepted the only call that came over the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.381" offset="12561499">And that is essentially the basis for the petitioner's claim on bad faith and the basis for the District Court's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.609" offset="12594413">If the court accepts our position that the proper standard is objective reasonableness, the question remains whether the interceptions in this case were objectively reasonable and in their briefs the petitioners do not seriously challenge the Court of Appeals conclusion that it was objectively reasonable to intercept all of the calls in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.922" offset="12671631">And they do not point at least in their briefs to any calls that should not have been intercepted or any reasons as to why they should not have been intercepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.771" offset="12707053">But the court may be interested in the question more generally of general considerations that apply to determining whether interceptions are reasonable or not reasonable and at the outset I want to stress again that it is not our intent to validly importance of the statutory minimization requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.923" offset="12795661">We recognize that they are designed to serve and accommodate important individual interest in privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.428" offset="12821679">But how those interests can best be implemented in each particular case often poses some very difficult problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.308" offset="12849160">Now the Court of Appeals started with a proposition that seems clearly correct to us, that the very nature of interceptions that are authorized and limited by the statute requires monitoring agents to listen to at least some portion of every call before they can make any judgment as to the likelihood that the call is going to be relevant or irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.589" offset="12938289">Now how much of the call may then be reasonably intercepted depends on a wide variety of circumstances including what the agents know about the callers, the scope of the criminal enterprise, the degree of coded language employed in the call and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.908" offset="12999520">And many of those considerations can be applied only after the agents have been able to develop some patterns among the calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.643" offset="13030554">The court of appeals have developed a number of relevant factors including those I have just mentioned but it would be impossible to enumerate an exhaustive list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.544" offset="13066080">In some kinds of cases, it may be possible for agents to develop more or less formal procedures or guidelines with respect to how they are going to go about and intercept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.169" offset="13104637">For example, in a gambling case, if they have reasonably if the John Smith is conducting his gambling business from a certain telephone, from his residential phone but has three small children or three teenaged children, it may be possible for the agents to develop guidelines and say do not listen to the calls of the children but listen to the calls of John Smith because in a gambling case, most of those kinds of calls are simply calls where the caller calls in and places a bet, right off the bat, they go right in the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.457" offset="13233786">In other kinds of cases like narcotics and especially particular like narcotics conspiracies where there many unknown participants and where one caller a always a known participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.974" offset="13279866">It is much more difficult for the agents to establish guidelines and they may have to rely on an ad hoc judgments about the nature of the calls they are listening to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.988" offset="13319886">And this case, I think reflects that narcotics conspiracies present some unique difficulties to agents conducting interceptions under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.556" offset="13382162">In narcotics conspiracies at least like this case it is very typical that the beginning portion of the conversation is largely ambiguous or irrelevant and then the participants may refer to a pseudo cause which means a delivery of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.318" offset="13457186">So it is much more difficult in this kind of case for agents to decide with any great degree of certainty, what kind of conversation they are listening to or to apply any formal procedures with respect to when to turn them off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.497" offset="13545897">With respect to the additional issues in this case concerning the scope of the suppression remedy and the standing of petitioner Scott we rely primarily on the arguments we've addressed in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.649" offset="13590515">I would only emphasize our response to the petitioner's argument that if as we contend, the statute only requires a suppression of conversations that should not have been intercepted because they are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.245" offset="13640879">Then agents will not be deterred -- they will not be deterred from listening to every conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.912" offset="13663553">That argument seems to us to misconceive the traditional purpose of the exclusionary rule which is not to punish police but rather to remove their incentives to commit unlawful acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.354" offset="13705349">Our position is fully consistent with that traditional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.311" offset="13721127">Any interception that should not have been intercepted should be suppressed thereby removing the agent's incentive to intercept communications and violation of minimization requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.515" offset="13765953">But beyond that there is even less reason in this context or a need in this context to expand the suppression remedy because this statute unlike the Fourth Amendment context imposes significant, affirmative sanctions on officers who violate their statutory obligations in bad faith, civil and criminal sanctions.</text>
