            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.981" offset="115834">This is a class action suit that comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.288" offset="137045">The merits of the case are not before us, the case presents a recurring question as to which party the class action plaintiff or the defendant should bear the expense of compiling the names and addresses of the  members of the plaintiff class.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.490" offset="209875">Although Civil Procedure Rule 23 deals specifically and in detail with class actions, the Court of Appeals held that the general discovery rules are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.523" offset="262015">Its decision would require the class action defendant not only to assist in compiling the list but also to bear in this case the $16,000 expense incident there too.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.227" offset="320843">We disagree with the Court of Appeals for reasons set forth in the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.772" offset="342995">We hold that Rule 23D, not to discovery rules is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.869" offset="367445">We further hold that although the District Court does have some discretion in allocating the cost of compiling the names and addresses of class members, that discretion was abused in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.902" offset="419586">We therefore reverse the  judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
