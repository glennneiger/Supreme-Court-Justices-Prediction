            <text syncTime="7.180" offset="108703">Multistate Tax Commission, brings us an appeal from Three-Judge District Court in the southern district of New York.19 states are members of an agreement called a Multistate Tax Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.237" offset="176935">This was entered into primarily to promote uniformity in state tax systems to facilitate the profit of termination of state and local tax liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.147" offset="224582">And to minimize tax payer inconvenience and duplicate taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.516" offset="246107">The compact established in Multistate Tax Commission and endowed with various powers subject to the consent of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.750" offset="282992">These powers included the right to conduct tax audits in the member states.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.569" offset="314339">Appellant corporations on behalf of themselves and other multistate taxpayers challenged the validity of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.375" offset="349552">They argued that the compact is invalid under the Compact Clause of the Constitution, because it has not been approved by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.312" offset="389258">They also contained that it is unreasonably burdened interstate commerce and violates their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.135" offset="432517">For the reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reject appellant's constitutional challenges and affirm the judgment of the District Court that sustain the validity of the Multi-state Tax Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.052" offset="496256">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Blackmun joins.</text>
