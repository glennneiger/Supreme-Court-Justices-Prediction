            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79981">We will hear arguments next in Moorman Manufacturing Company v. Bair</text>
            <text syncTime="89.763" offset="439008">Mr. Barnes, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald K. Barnes</label>
            <text syncTime="93.216" offset="452801">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.924" offset="467638">This is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Iowa upholding that state?s taxing scheme which has the purpose and effect of imposing a tariff on imports while subsidizing exports.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.306" offset="521137">The case differs from General Motors Corporation v. District of Columbia which this Court decided in 1965, only in irrelevant factual details and that the issue here is purely constitutional, whereas the Court was able to decide the District of Columbia case on statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.845" offset="607341">The appellant is the Moorman Manufacturing Company which is an Illinois based corporation with a business of manufacturing animal feeds which it sells to farmers and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.829" offset="663243">It has warehouses and salesmen in Iowa, but no manufacturing in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.650" offset="686544">Everything sold into Iowa is manufactured in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.628" offset="706397">The corporation paid the Iowa corporate income tax computing its apportionable income in the manner prescribed in the Iowa statute as to which there is no dispute and then it apportioned that income, following the three factor formula of the uniform division of income for tax purposes act, that is in fact a formula of property, payroll and sales equally weighted with the sales assigned to the destination, in this case Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.993" offset="831890">The assessments are for the difference between the tax as such apportioned and the Iowa formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.355" offset="869401">The Iowa formula provides for a single sales factor by destination, not attributing anything to either property or payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.612" offset="914332">The Iowa statute starts with federal taxable income and makes certain adjustments in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.985" offset="947873">Then having done that, it applies a fraction, numerator of which is Iowa sales and denominator sales to customers all over to that amount of total income and this has the effect of attributing to Iowa all of the income which is derived from the manufacture in Illinois and the sale to customers in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.936" offset="1055707">There was no tax on income from an Iowa manufacturer selling into Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.152" offset="1092487">All the facts are stipulated to total taxable income, the apportionment fractions, any one of the three apportionment fractions, the amounts of tax which will be due if the statute is held constitutional and also the amount of tax which will be due if it is held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.563" offset="1170228">So the sole question in the case is the constitutionality of a single sales fraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.173" offset="1200634">The appellee agrees with that and that appears in this motion to dismiss and also in its brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.690" offset="1222681">Mr. Barnes, I just have one question there.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.898" offset="1231563">If the statute is unconstitutional, why do you owe any tax?</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>

            <label>Mr. Donald K. Barnes</label>
            <text syncTime="297.415" offset="1269597">Because Mr. Justice Stevens, the statute imposing tax is not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.688" offset="1294675">The only thing that is unconstitutional is the so called apportionment formula.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="308.527" offset="1314005">But you say that the constitution mandates the three-partite formula that you used in filling out your returns?</text>

          <turn speaker="donald_k_barnes" startTime="316.307" stopTime="333.234">
            <label>Mr. Donald K. Barnes</label>
            <text syncTime="316.307" offset="1345143">No, Mr. Justice Stevens, we do not call on the Court to impose a formula or perform any other legislative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.592" offset="1378267">We merely say that the single sales factor is unconstitutional and that is all that the Court has asked to do.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="333.234" offset="1412853">If that is correct then, as my brother Stevens has indicated, you would owe no tax under the Iowa statute and yet you voluntarily paid the tax, did you not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_k_barnes" startTime="351.235" stopTime="385.777">
            <label>Mr. Donald K. Barnes</label>
            <text syncTime="351.235" offset="1484846">I would not go that far Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.351" offset="1493310">I think the statute is perfectly is valid except for this apportionment formula and the statute not only says that, I should not say apportionment, reasonable apportionment, this single factor sales form of attribution I think is unconstitutional, but the statute also says that in the case of interstate commerce, the tax payer shall pay a reasonable portion and so I think that knocking out the formula does not knock out the statute nor the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.771" offset="1610965">It just leaves a question as to how it will be computed.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.804" offset="1679197">Well, that is what we agreed on, but the statute almost all these statutes in all states contain a provision that if there is something wrong with a statutory formula, the commissioner or the director can work out something that fits in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.747" offset="1734890">A prime example was the one in California, the McDonald Douglas case and California statute provided that the property factor is going to consider only owned property.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.491" offset="1781911">McDonald Douglas owned a big factory in California and they leased a big factory in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.616" offset="1814407">They said it is not fair to attribute all of our property to California when we are using this property in another state, the California Supreme Court agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.725" offset="1846799">This was a case in which the statute was improper in its application to a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.466" offset="1873757">So the statutes permit that all along including the Iowa statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.676" offset="1938645">All the other states, including Illinois, not all, but all the ones that are pertinent, including Illinois used this three factor formula of property payroll and sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.724" offset="2862858">Now, they say for instance, Moorman has a factory in Texas that sells to Texas customers, by not taxing any of that, they say, Moorman?s entire income is apportioned, but the apportionment of the entire income is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.209" offset="2912804">What counts is the income on the segment of the business that consists of manufacture in Illinois and selling to customers in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.096" offset="2948330">The sales fraction of course does not do any apportioning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2006.132" offset="8104484">It applies to retail merchants, wholesale merchants, in state manufacturers, out of state manufacturers, manufacturers manufacturing in state and out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.030" offset="8144085">Moorman?s evidence of course was only directed towards its own facts which it agrees on page of four of its brief that that is all the issues really are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.454" offset="8177731">This as I say suggests that this case really involves the constitutionality of the Iowa formula as applied to Moorman?s facts and it is too broad to say that it involves an attack upon the statute that as invalid under any conceivable circumstances which are not even before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.555" offset="8262159">Due process principles derived from constitutional apportionment cases decided by this Court are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.152" offset="8292565">First, the statutory formula and the results reached in its application are presumed constitutional and a tax payer must show unconstitutionality beyond reasonable doubt, rebut all reasonable bases to support the formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.335" offset="8345228">Second, the states have great leeway in their choice and application of formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.946" offset="8363723">Third, Court has never stricken an apportionment formula on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.744" offset="8382949">In the 100 and some odd years of constitutional history of formulas in this country it has never been stricken on its face, but has adopted the case by case approach, carefully reviewing the record in the Courts below to see if the taxpayer showed constitutional transgression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.565" offset="8454211">A taxpayer has in this area not merely the burden of proof, but extremely heavy burden of proof in challenging a formula?s constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.173" offset="8496634">This generally requires a powerful evidentiary showing against the formula and not merely as in this case, arguments of counsel and of course precise apportionment is impossible, rough approximation being sufficient, the Court having long recognized that it is generally impossible to specifically allocate the profits of a unitary business to activities carried on in taxing state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.615" offset="8594437">Now, an application of these due process principles to this case for the years in question, the Iowa apportionment formula as applied to the Iowa computed net income tax base showed that Moorman earned from about 21.9 or 22% of its income in Iowa to about 18.7% for the five years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.310" offset="8693179">This is stipulated and there is really no dispute as to the fact that the formula shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.497" offset="8717943">We believe that Moorman was required to show to satisfy its burden of proof that the Iowa law was unconstitutional, that they did not earn that amount, but they earned a substantially lesser amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.984" offset="8767890">Now, the only evidence in this case in the stipulated data, there were no witnesses, we have stipulated data in this case, consisted of mere comparison of the results reached by Moorman?s three factor formula which is about 12.2 to 14.5% of its income in Iowa and of course the Iowa formula listing the percentages that I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.133" offset="8856497">In other words, we have a comparison of one estimate with another estimate with no evidence in the case which estimate may be right or which estimate may be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.476" offset="8905816">For all that appears in this case, we have actually undertaxed Moorman.</text>

            <text syncTime="3094.170" offset="12456588">That is what I least I meant my answer to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.550" offset="12486159">I believe that this Court has also held and correctly so in Ford Motor Company v. Beauchamp that constitutionality of state taxation ought not to turn upon so narrow an issue as to whether local assets rather than local gross receipts are used in an apportionment formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.865" offset="12575393">The presumption of constitutionality must in this type of a case, in apportionment cases must be overcome by evidence and not by the argument of counsel to satisfy the heavy burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.816" offset="12639237">I would like to get on now into the argument in this case involving interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.117" offset="12668389">Now again, as far as the Iowa statute is concerned, the basic argument of Moorman which is that the Iowa formula is bad per se, means that it must necessarily regardless of the facts cause multiple taxation to be visited upon Moorman or anybody else for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.880" offset="12771416">We believe that the sum and substance of Moorman?s argument in this regard is that anybody that deviates from the three factor formula automatically creates multiple taxation or a risk of multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.428" offset="12841633">We think Moorman?s argument is somewhat inconsistent in that in its brief at page 25, it says it accepts a single property factor formula which of course is such a deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.362" offset="12889385">The argument also we think assumes that you have an easily definable tax base such as what you would have in the gross receipts area where everybody can see the gross receipts and that that is what you are apportioning, that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.971" offset="12951765">What is being apportioned here is net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.230" offset="12964827">A state like Iowa offers what might be called somewhat of a low tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.630" offset="12990427">We do allow large deductions, including a federal income tax deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.746" offset="13010907">I do not believe that is allowed by the state of Illinois for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.719" offset="13022819">It is only allowed by about six states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.636" offset="13114456">If Moorman?s argument were accepted, any formula that would deviate somehow from a uniform formula or a tax base that would be different, would somehow create the risk of multiple taxation, destroying the leeway states have in this area, a leeway I might add and it seems to me that this Court has recognized at least in the area of non business income and disparate use of combination corporate tax reporting recently in the US Steel Corporation vs. Multistate tax commission case decided in February 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.747" offset="13278923">While that case did involve the compact clause of the constitution I believe there were arguments made as to interstate commerce and the Court recognized that the states did do things differently but held that that was not necessarily bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.493" offset="13341930">Of course, only Congress would have the power in any event to act affirmatively under the Commerce Clause and if they wanted to impose upon all the states a uniform apportionment formula or even a uniform tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.510" offset="13446002">The power of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.736" offset="13454884">It is the most fundamental power a state can have in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.339" offset="13473274">I would also like to make a few comments about General Motors v. District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.186" offset="13496680">I think the parties here agreed that that case did not reach the constitutional issues that are being raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.070" offset="13528236">In addition, there was no exclusive formula in that case approved by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.046" offset="13548089">The Court read the district?s statute which of course prescribed no formula as requiring one which automatically would give effect to geographical spread of all components of a manufacturing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.175" offset="13600647">There was no overruling of prior constitutional case presence particularly the single factor cases and the Ford Motor case involving the very formula that we have here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.169" offset="13648608">The case does not implicate a taxpayer?s heavy burden of proof that a statutory formula is unconstitutional and we believe that based upon this Court?s reading of the district statute in that case that a single property factor probably would have been inconsistent with the statute insofar as applying it to an integrated manufacturing selling business, manufacturing in one state and selling goods in the district of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.135" offset="13760517">We believe that the Court?s standards on multiple taxation should be derived from the cases of Northwest Portland Cement case and also its recent case in 1975, the Standard Press Steel case in which the Court seems to be going to an actual burden and it certainly is not a mere risk on the basis of argument of counsel that is an abstract notion of a risk of multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.600" offset="13878381">For these reasons, we do not feel that the Iowa formula contravenes the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.311" offset="13913176">As to facial equal protection, again, this involves that there is necessarily a discrimination against out of state manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.015" offset="13947971">No evidence on this issue was introduced, only extreme hypotheticals were presented by Moorman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.700" offset="13974721">It should also be remembered that even if there were some companies along the extreme hypotheticals Moorman presented that as a company manufacturing totally out of Iowa and then selling in Iowa or an Iowa manufacturer manufacturing in Iowa and selling totally out of Iowa, that iron rule of taxation is neither attainable nor required that as this Court has held under the equal protection clause, too rigorous a scrutiny ought not to be made, otherwise all taxing schemes would fall since it is impossible to define any taxing scheme or to make one up which has no discriminatory impact whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.597" offset="14146293">We fail to see that Moorman?s argument with reference to that portion of its brief regarding constitutionality as applied is any different from that portion of its brief with reference to facial constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.589" offset="14206270">The Iowa Supreme Court agreed with this in that regard and because they held that the Iowa formula was not proven bad on its face, they also held that Moorman did not satisfy its burden of proof to overturn the formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.843" offset="14259351">In conclusion, we believe that the decision of the Iowa Supreme Court is correct and that it ought to be affirmed by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3559.481" offset="14317865">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.632" offset="14326433">That one minute is quite sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.908" offset="14335524">The arguments that have been made are all adequately answered in our briefs and reply brief, but I want to emphasize to the Court one thing, that the directive here is challenging the assumption which is inherent in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.065" offset="14408144">We did not make any assumption, the statute makes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.560" offset="14418175">That assumption is that the income derived with respect to any dollar of sales is the same as income derived from any other dollar of sales and that is the basis for the attribution of income to the income producing activities in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.644" offset="14498528">They keep arguing for separate accounting because this Court has held that separate accounting is impermissible in the case of a unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.310" offset="14529143">Hans Rees was not a unitary business.</text>
