            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="59.205" offset="316759">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.503" offset="329925">This case is here on the Court's grant of the Government's petition for writ of certiorari to review the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, suppressing respondent's Grand Jury testimony as evidence in the trail of a two-count indictment, charging her with transmitting a threat in interstate commerce and with perjury before the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.066" offset="412158">Respondent was employed as a skip tracer by several bill collection agencies that subsequently became a focus of Grand Jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.751" offset="446953">On one occasion she called the brother of an individual who had incurred gambling debts on a junkets of Puerto Rico and had not paid them.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.648" offset="478509">In this call, which unbenounced to her, the brother recorded, she threatened the debtor's life if the debt were not promptly paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.301" offset="513095">In June 1974, respondent was subpoenaed to appear and did appear before a Grand Jury, being conducted by an attorney from the Department of Justice Strike Force, who was specially assigned from Washington for the purpose of conducting an investigation that encompassed the respondent's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.385" offset="585507">Respondent, when she appeared, was given advise of her privilege against self incrimination and was also advised that she could consult with an attorney if she felt the need to do so at any time and was warned about the seriousness of the offense of perjury and the penalties therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.026" offset="652067">She was not expressly told that she was a target of a Grand Jury's investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.629" offset="678398">During the course of the questioning of respondent about her employer's business and her own activities therein, the government attorney read to her from a transcript of the threatening conversations had with the debtor's brother and she unequivocally denied having made any of the statements contained therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.261" offset="744958">She was not told of the existence of the recording of this conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.247" offset="764916">Respondent was thereafter indicted for the substantive threat and for the false testimony to the grand jury denying the threatening conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.447" offset="797725">She moved the District Court to suppress her Grand Jury testimony, relying on the lower court decisions in United States against Mandujano and United States against Washington which in one instance had suppressed Grand Jury testimony to for failure to give full Miranda warnings and in another for failure to target warnings to a putative defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.766" offset="879018">The government appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed the suppression ruling, although on grounds of supervisory power, rather than on the basis of any finding of constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.434" offset="921650">In reaching its decision, the court followed a rather unusual practice of making written inquiry of all United States Attorneys in the Circuit to learn their policies with regard to administration of target warnings and having been advised that it was their policy to administer such warnings, the Court upheld the suppression for the stated reason of achieving uniformity in the criminal procedure in this Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.772" offset="1015064">The United States petitioned this Court for writ of certiorari which was granted and case was remanded to the Court of appeals for reconsideration in light of this Court's reversal in Mandujano.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.713" offset="1062816">On remand, the Court of Appeals adhered to its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.167" offset="1076609">It found no occasion to depart from its prior ruling because of this Court's decision in Mandujano, since the suppression ruling in that case had been predicated on a supposed violation of the defendant's constitutional rights, whereas here, the Court found that none of respondent's rights had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.628" offset="1146408">The court thought its suppression order was justified as a remedy to ensure that various prosecutors follow uniform practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.748" offset="1178904">In a striking self contradiction, the court stated that its remedy was a one time, ad hoc sanction, intended to let our citizens know that equal justice is available to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.687" offset="1230731">The court indicated that it felt comfortable in pursuing its didactic purpose of teaching the prosecutor a lesson in this case because in its field, the prosecutor was not entitled to the luxury of a perjury count as to which the court was effectively pardoning respondent when they remain the substantive count upon which prosecution of respondent was still possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.383" offset="1469490">We would be here, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.098" offset="1484328">The Falco (Ph) question in this case is the power of Court of Appeals to apply the remedy of suppression to a defendant's Grand Jury testimony as a means of teaching the executive branch the lesson that it must achieve uniformity of prosecutorial practices and secondly assuming some such power exists, the soundness of Court's exercise of that power in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.882" offset="1579414">I think it is best if I begin by making clear by what we are not contending and what the Court need not decide in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.361" offset="1609402">First, we are not contending that uniformity of prosecutorial practice is undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.441" offset="1629673">It is the hope of the Department of Justice that similarly situated persons will be to the extent feasible, similarly treated by Federal prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.961" offset="1663737">Although, I think it must be recognized that there are so many different individual prosecutors handling so many different matters of such complexity that actual uniformity in practice necessarily remains a goal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="413.256" offset="1732909">Well, the Court of appeal was disturbed by that aspect of the case, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.278" offset="1773033">Second we are not here today to argue that target warnings are undesirable as a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.191" offset="1796648">Indeed the Court of Appeals itself did not assert in this case that target waring should be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.970" offset="1819845">It said that the Department of Justice would be equally free to require target warnings or to prohibit them if it wished to as long as the practice followed was uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.324" offset="1865193">Thirdly this Court need not decide whether the courts generally would have the power to adopt the rule prospectively which would require the administration of any particular kind of warnings in the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.222" offset="1916811">Well, I have serious doubts that such warn -- that such rules would be properly promulgated by a panel of a Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.637" offset="1946486">The issue here is not the power to establish such rules as the part of the court's control over the Grand Jury.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="496.059" offset="2064142">Well, I am not -- I will get to somethings that I think they did not understand a little later in my argument [Laughter] about the prosecutorial practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.237" offset="2112834">In any event, I was trying to make the point that the Court does -- does not have to decide here the question of the existence of power as an aspect of the power of the courts over the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.931" offset="2167691">Rather the question here is the power of the courts to impose the remedy of suppression in the absence of any court made or statutory rule that the prosecutor has violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.817" offset="2211159">The suppression of respondent's Grand Jury testimony in this case represents, I submit, a wholly unprecedented exercise of judicial supervisory power and we have educed in our brief a number of independent grounds for concluding that this exercise of supervisory power was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.138" offset="2280436">Now, first of all no one disputes that the judicial supervisory power maybe circumscribed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.734" offset="2302901">I do not think that the court disputed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.877" offset="2315440">In part one of our brief, we have argued that two statutes, rule 402 of the Federal rules of evidence and 18 U.S.C 3501, deprive the courts of the remedy of suppressing relevant evidence, especially if the evidence consists of a statement by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.746" offset="2382940">I intend to rely on our brief with regard to these points and pass on here to our arguments that apart from any statutory restrictions on the supervisory power, the Court of Appeals' exercise of it in this case was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.856" offset="2443335">Now first, we can compare, I think what the Court of Appeals did here with any other past exercise of supervisory power by this Court or indeed by other Federal Courts of Appeals and we can see that there are some striking differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.019" offset="2504044">The case is on which respondent relies and on which the court relied, by and large involve the exercise of supervisory power over the conduct of the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.209" offset="2544795">That is with regard to such matters as voir dire questioning of prospective jurors, conformity to Rule 11 proceedings, regularity in sentencing practice, rules of evidence, rules regarding instruction of juries, the Allen Charge, those kind of matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.380" offset="2621490">We do not for moment question that these kinds of rules are -- are inherently necessary as a part of the supervisory powers of the Appellate Courts over the conduct of the District Courts and except of course to the extent any statute imposes restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.220" offset="2700798">We do not think that helps to justify the result that the Court of Appeals reached here.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.990" offset="2723890">The only significant case it seems to me which involves something, outside of the trial context itself, is the McNabb case which of course is the famous instance in which the police violated the defendant's rights for a prompt presentation to a magistrate and the court found that that violation justified the application of an exclusionary rule, excluding the defendant's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.126" offset="2848442">Now, there are a couple of important differences between McNabb and the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.260" offset="2872997">The first and most significant is that the probable basis for the court's power in McNabb which was the power to make common law rules of evidence in accordance with reason and which was codified and formed Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, has been abolished with the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence which is a fresh codification and which I think takes away the supervisory power over evidence that may previously have existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.938" offset="2995668">Second distinction between McNabb and the present case is that in McNabb there was a flagrant violation of an existing statutory right of the defendant and it was as a means of enforcing this right of the defendant that the Court acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.305" offset="3073200">Now, here there was no right.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.548" offset="3078111">The respondent had no right to a target warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.639" offset="3086470">According to Court of Appeals, there was simply an irregularity in practice and departure from a informal departmental or U.S. Attorney policy involved, we think that is a very substantial difference from McNabb.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.685" offset="3150627">I respectfully suggest that the the assertion of supervisory power here over prosecutorial conduct that did not violate respondent's constitutional or statutory rights is undisciplined and is intrusive on the proper allocation of judicial and executive responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.031" offset="3216037">What the Court of Appeals was doing here was in fact exercising a chancellor's foot veto over law enforcement practices of which it disapproved, something that this Court in turn specifically --</text>

            <text syncTime="1336.097" offset="5424325">But I think --- I mean, we are -- we are relying on two statutes, each of which we suggest independently takes away the power that the Court might previously have had prior to the enactment of those statutes and anyway to return to the question apart from the statutes of what is a proper exercise of judicial supervisory power, I suggest that the chancellor's foot veto that was condemned in Russel was even more inappropriate in the case of supervising a prosecutor's conduct than it is in supervising police conduct in entrapment situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.625" offset="5578447">On this connection the words of the Chief Justice says, the Circuit Judge in Newman against the United States are singularly opposite and I think worth quoting here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.004" offset="5611988">The Chief Justice said, “An attorney for the United States as any other attorney appears in a dual rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.265" offset="5636961">He is at once an officer of the Court and the agent and attorney for a client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.765" offset="5655038">In the first capacity he is responsible to the Court for the manner of his conduct of the case, that is his demeanor, deportment in ethical conduct, but in his second capacity as an agent and attorney for the executive, he is responsible to his principal and the Courts have no power over the exercise of his desecration or his motives as they relate to the execution of his duty within the framework of his professional employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.016" offset="5752005">To say that every United States attorney must literally treat very offense and very offender alike is to delegate him an impossible task.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.807" offset="5787113">Of course this concept would negate desecration” and now this is an important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.420" offset="5809578">“It is assumed that the United States Attorney will perform his duties and exercise his powers consistent with his oaths and while this desecration is subject to abuse or misuse just as his judicial desecration, deviations from his duty as an agent of the executive are to be dealt with by his superiors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.480" offset="5885856">Now in this case, I want to reiterate that there is no suggestion here of any deliberate impropriety by the strike force attorney or any departure from a statute or rule or even a published policy or policy of general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.906" offset="5939564">This was at most a negligent mistake on his part and I like to comeback to a point that I mentioned earlier in connection with the wisdom of the courts attempting to enforce upon the prosecutors' policies and that is the court's can often make mistakes that perhaps the executive branch with regard to its own policy would not make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.488" offset="6021902">Page 5A of the appendix to the petition in the Court of Appeals' second opinion in this case, they relied upon the guidelines involving the relationship between the strike force and the United States Attorney and they invoke the guideline that says when a specific investigation has progressed to the point where there is to be presentation for an indictment, the Chief of the Strike Force shall then for this purpose, operate under the direction of the United States Attorney, who shall oversee the judicial phase of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.196" offset="6136736">Now I -- my understanding is contrary to the Court of Appeal's understanding, that what that means is the Strike Force Attorney is on his own, until he is ready to present the case for an indict, and that the conduct of the investigation in the Grand Jury is -- is not under the direct control of the United States Attorney in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.136" offset="6216462">It is only when he decides to indict, that he comes to the United States Attorney for the authority and the United States Attorney takes over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.345" offset="6241330">Now I do not rely on that point for anything more than to show that when courts get outside what seems to me to be their legitimate domain, they are in danger of making mistakes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.341" offset="6865343">I wanted to make two more points very briefly, if I may before my time expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.172" offset="6884569">One is that, to compare the exclusionary rule which the court has an effect applied in this case with Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule and to point out that there is some significant differences here, the most important is that in Mapp against Ohio the court said in effect, we have no way to control the conduct of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.183" offset="6960638">The only way we can make the police respect people's constitutional rights is by imposing the sanction that we have at hand and that sanction is exclusion of evidence and we hope by the employment of that sanction that we will accomplish the salutary objectives of -- of conformity of police conduct to the requirements of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.875" offset="7039423">Now, in this case we are dealing with prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.217" offset="7048827">If the court announces a rule that Target warning should be given, if it feels that is appropriate and then let us assume it has the power, what reason is they had to suppose that prosecutors will deliberately violate that rule which such consistency that exclusion of evidence is necessary or that if they do violate that rule, the court does not have in its hand a simple remedy of direct discipline against the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.536" offset="7142032">So the situation is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.760" offset="7151018">In closing, let me point to what seems to me be the quintessential irony of the Court of Appeals ruling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.265" offset="7177036">In its zeal to ensure uniformity of prosecutorial practices, the court has indicated that it will engage in apparently sporadic half-hazard imposition of penalties on prosecutors, not in all cases, under some identifiable standards, but from time to time, when it feels it is necessary to teach the prosecutor a lesson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.036" offset="7256031">They sought to arm themselves with a sword of Damocles to wheel as they wish from time-to-time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.674" offset="7282676">In affect equal justice in the Courts is forsworn in favor of supervision over the prosecutor's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.120" offset="7312455">The supervision that ought in principle to be exercised by the executive branch itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1874.891" offset="7579531">Mr. Chief Justice and if it pleases the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.874" offset="7611401">Mr. Frey has most reasonably stated the underlying factual pattern in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.986" offset="7639926">However, whether it would be from the standpoint of the legal issues or the philosophy underlying the legal issues, I believe that the thrust of the argument has failed to address the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.385" offset="7701471">I do not believe this case involves an instance where the Appellate Court seeks to direct the prosecutor in what he must or must not say and I believe the underlying opinion of the Court of Appeals expressively states that, if the prosecutor wishes or the Attorney General wishes they need not as a law is presently constituted, give any type of warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.116" offset="7812439">I believe what the Court of Appeals was concerned about and what I was initially concerned about as defense counsel in this matter, who brings ten years of having been a prosecuted as a background to this type of case, was the conduct that would be taking place before a norm of the court to with the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.755" offset="7907002">I heard many questions asked to Mr. Frey, which seem to address the problem as to whether or not this was a chancellor's veto of the executive branch of the government concerning what was or was not to be said to a witness who was a prospective defendant before a Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.655" offset="7994565">I submit to you that, that is not the question, that is not thrust of the Court of Appeals decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.604" offset="8022359">I believe what the Court was concerned about and is concerned with and properly concerned with, is that the Grand Jury which is a norm of the court and not of the executive branch of the government was being used in a manner that it determined, required its action within the scope of its supervisory power, and again I wish to reiterate that the court in its second opinion as well as in its first opinion indicated that the prosecutor could adopt any policy he wished, concerning the granting of any warnings to any prospective defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.205" offset="8212739">So therefore, to seek to have this case revolve around a contest between the exercise of executive power and the exercise of judicial power, I believe begs the question and fails to identify it properly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.545" offset="8390163">I believe the court was explicit in its articulation of the legal principle concerning the exercise of it's supervisory power that a) this was not a general principle to be applied in all cases, that it had considered particularly this fact pattern which involved the situation of the court's Grand Jury the people's Grand Jury, not the prosecutor's Grand Jury, sir and what takes place before and Mr. Justice Marshall indicated that many members of the bench that related to this problem maybe gentlemen who have prosecutorial background and I believe that -- if that is the case that was important to the consideration of this case because any jurist, I submit most respectfully, who has not logged time in a Grand Jury as a prosecutor, does not know the omnipotent power that a prosecutor has in that room, concerning the witness and what takes place to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.237" offset="8692870">I submit to this Court that as a practical matter, the Grand Jury is a non-functioning body which constitutes a rubber stamp for the prosecutor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Irving P. Seidman</label>
            <text syncTime="3303.006" offset="13291988">Well, getting back to the heart of this case, Your Honor, I believe that the Court of Appeals exercised supervisory power not in conflict with Section 3501 or with Rule 402 and the the -- the best thinking of the Court as to why it was doing it, I believe is -- is the quote given in the opinion where the Court, quote is from Judge Friendly in U.S. v. Stepper (Ph) and stated, a reversal with instructions to dismiss the indictment may help to translate the assurances of United States Attorneys into consistent performance by their assistant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.408" offset="13493549">Again, this is a sole limited narrow issue that is before this Court and it does not particularly have relationship solely with respect to target warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.006" offset="13560005">It might well be that the Court of Appeals as stated by Mr. Frey, may in some future matter, unforeseen, seek to exercise its supervisory power and I cannot believe that this Court, given the long line of cases, some of which Your Honor has written, Mr. Justice Burger -- Chief Justice Burger has written opinions in, has identified and recognized the supervisory power of the -- of the Court of Appeals to deal with matters within the Circuit and if I may respectfully relate to Mr. Justice Marshall's dissenting opinion in the first Jacob's case, the case has cited therein the Cupp v. Naughten case, Barko v. Wingo, United States v. Thomas, Ristaino v. Ross and Murphy v. Florida, some of which have their opinions from Mr. Chief Justice Burger, clearly acknowledged the existence of propriety of exercise of supervisory powers and at times, the opinions seek to avoid the exercise of Federal Supervisory Power in General -- in State criminal cases, but use of affirmative language which clearly states that, had this been a Federal Court matter that the United States Supreme Court in these instances would have recommended the utilization of supervisory power to justify whatever Court's concept of fair and equal application of the law to all people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.115" offset="14052361">I submit to the Court that the sanction herein, given the argument of the Court of Appeals which I am limited to, is that the defendant in this case is not escaping justice, so therefore, I do not know that the sanction part of this case is that troublesome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.052" offset="14144103">The only issue that I could conceive of as being of importance to the -- and crucial to this is, whether or not this was a reasonable application of the supervisory power and again I wish to reiterate in -- in my closing argument that this not a trial proper that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.115" offset="14232396">What is before this Court is the conduct and management of the Grand Jury which is norm of the judiciary and not a norm of the executive branch of Government and I believe it was in this context, the Court Of Appeals so ought to apply its supervisory power not of the prosecutor, which is the effect of what has happened here, but rather as to what takes place before the Court's Grand Jury, before which the prosecutor practices as a part of the executive branch of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.798" offset="14407103">And in response to Mr. Justice Stevens' question in his concurring opinion in the first case, it would assume -- it is clear to me that this is not an inexorable rule to be applied in all instances and this Court need not be fearful that with each slip of the tongue in any particular criminal law prosecution that there will be a -- a dismissal or suppression which would result in non prosecutorial happenings with respect to people who should be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.946" offset="14575750">And -- and the Court of Appeals clearly stated that it, in deciding this case, it a perjury, but it felt that given the fact that there was another portion of the case to be tried, that it could take this law just so to speak, if the Court wanted to picture it as such and employ the sanction of suppression, and therefore, the dismissal of the indictment which flow there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.342" offset="14713258">I might -- I might add, getting back to what Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated that given, in closing, given the fact that the citizen's rights before the Grand Jury have been limited by Mandujano, Wang and Washington that consistent with what Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, that possibly and humbly this Court might consider the ABA standards as to what should be the procedure before the Grand Juries which represent throughout the United States, all of -- all of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.850" offset="14899355">I thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3710.800" offset="14923178">I think in response to Mr. Justice Stevens' questions about the -- whether there is any difference between the Court of Appeals' supervisory power and in this Court's supervisory power, on the context of deciding a case, I do not believe there is any difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3730.608" offset="15002382">Now, you do have the power in the context of passing a Rule of Criminal Procedures as the Chief Justice suggested earlier, but that is a totally different procedure in one to which we would not make exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="3788.575" offset="15234245">This may very well have had exactly the opposite effect by the punishment that was administered in this case because I understand in the Southern District of New York they now have stopped giving target warnings, in order, they have no longer have a policy of giving target warnings, so that they cannot be accused of violating their policy and having suppression administered on that basis.</text>
