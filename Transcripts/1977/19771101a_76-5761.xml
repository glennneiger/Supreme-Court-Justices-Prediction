            <text syncTime="40.433" offset="241632">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.561" offset="254170">The question that I present to the court today is whether or not an individual can be charged, convicted and sentenced under the aggravated bank robbery statute 18, 2113 (d) and additionally charged, convicted and sentenced under 924 (c)(1) for using a firearm during the commission of the felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.350" offset="349361">The tenure of our argument has changed somewhat from a double jeopardy question to a question of multiplicity or duplicity, but I still think that the dictates of the Blockburger case are applicable in that you we must show that each offense requires proof of an element that the other does not and it has been our contention since the inception of this case that in order to sustain a conviction under 924 (c)(1) that all of the elements under 2113 (d) must be proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.728" offset="506827">Now, the Fourth and Fifth Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit in following the Fourth and the Fifth Circuit in their opinion in the lower court stated that they thought there was a difference in proof of the elements and they base their decision on the language contained in 2113 wherein the government is required to prove that an individual's life was endangered by the use of a dangerous weapon or device and that a dangerous weapon or device was not always a firearm and it is my contention that in getting to the elements in 2113 (d) that you have to prove every single one of them to prove that the felony in 924 (c) was committed and that you cannot sit back and judge the facts of each case in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.221" offset="748825">You have to look at the weapon that was used, and when a firearm or a handgun is used, it fits both in 2113 (d) and 924 (c).</text>

            <text syncTime="180.083" offset="800234">Well when you say the Blockburger test is not one where you compare the statute, but where you simply compare the evidence in each particular case?</text>

            <text syncTime="194.471" offset="857808">Well, then I do not see how you can advance the proposition that you compare the weapon involved in each particular case because here clearly a dangerous weapon or a device includes other things than a firearm?</text>

            <text syncTime="212.146" offset="928548">That is correct, but I do say that you have to look at the factual elements in Fifth Amendment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.339" offset="961253">You have to draw the statutes sufficiently broad to encompass all the factual situations that may occur, but I do not think that in viewing 924 (c) as opposed to 2113 (d), you can just say, suppose something else was used.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.110" offset="1192384">I do think that the legislators in drafting 2113 (d) had to have thought that the most common weapon or dangerous weapon or device to be used would be a handgun, or firearm, or rifle, or shotgun, something that would be encompassed by 924 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="295.981" offset="1263855">I think that we see it on TV and we read about it occasionally that other weapons are used to rob banks and usually they are more dangerous than a firearm.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.502" offset="1981909">Mr. Chief Justice I do not believe if there is. I believe that Congress provided the enhanced penalty under 2113 (d) if any sort of weapon, dangerous weapon or device was used and endangered anybody's life and I think that 924 (c) was enacted in response to the growing concern for the use of firearm specifically in committing crimes and I have to agree with Representative Poff's comments that it was not intended to be used in cases where there was already an enhanced punishment provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.379" offset="2141465">Since the time of submission of our briefs, I was sent a copy of letter written from the Department of Justice to United States Attorney in Maryland Mr. I believe it is Beal (Ph) wherein the Department of Justice said, “It was their policy not to prosecute on the 924 (c) charge when the defensible offense was a 2113 (d) charge” and they cited the general principle of law that when a specific statute and a general statute are involved in the same set of facts that the general statute should be used, and additionally they cited Representative Poff's comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.660" offset="2314605">Now, I think that the legislative history in enacting these statutes should be considered in cases where the statement that Congress' best means what it says has to be looked at when you cannot really determine what Congress says.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.675" offset="2430588">In a case of this nature where the government is arguing that they do not mean what they say and that you should not listen to Representative Poff's comments and the fact that you do have what on its face is a conflict, that this Court has to use the tools that are available to it to determine exactly what they did mean and as I have stated before I think that they have created an absurdity and they could carry it one step father by saying that whoever uses a Saturday night special which costs less than $50, shall be guilty of an additional offense and I think that would follow in line with the logic that has been used in allowing a 924 (c) charge to be tacked on to a 2113 (d) charge and basically I rest my case on Representative Poff's comments and the absurdity that is committed when you let a person be charged with robbing a bank using a gun, and using a gun to rob a bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.057" offset="3400149">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.813" offset="3411225">Within the two month period in the fall of 1975, petitioners in this case robbed two banks in Middlesboro, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.749" offset="3442886">They carried and used firearms in the commission of each robbery and while attempting to escape from the second robbery, engaged in an extensive gunfire with the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.430" offset="3485622">Petitioners' conduct quite plainly violated several provisions of federal law and the juries in both cases so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.687" offset="3518641">In each instance, petitioners were convicted under 18 U.S.C. 2113 (a) which makes it a felony to rob a federal bank and under 18 U.S.C. 2113 (d) which provides an increased penalty for anyone who are robbing a federal bank in the words of the statute, assaults any person or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.485" offset="3621877">Petitioners were also convicted under 18 U.S.C. 924 (c)(1), a part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, which provides an additional term of imprisonment for anyone who in the words of that statute, uses a firearm to commit any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.295" offset="3709126">The trial judge sentenced petitioners to the maximum terms of imprisonment allowed for each crime, 25 years for each offense under Section 2113 (d), and another 10 years for each offense under Section 924 (c), all sentences to be served consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.740" offset="3774850">Petitioners have attacked their sentences on the ground that 924 (c) while seeming on its face to apply to any federal felony is not available to punish bank robbers who who used the firearms as makes the absurdity to punishment under Section 2113 (d) as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.179" offset="3844649">They rely for this proposition on a statement by Congressman Poff who sponsored Section 924 (c) on the house floor that this bill was not intended to apply to various federal offenses of which bank robbery under Section 2113 is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.343" offset="3913299">This argument in our view raises two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.693" offset="3926673">First, did Congress intend Section 924 (c) apply to bank robbers, simultaneously subject to conviction under Section 2113 (d) and if Congress did so intend, secondly does the Double Jeopardy Clause in anyway prohibit that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.678" offset="3994696">For reasons we shall discuss in a moment, I believe that the intent of Congress to punish for both offenses is evident from the statute itself and from the way to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.637" offset="4038477">We furthermore believe that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not prohibited from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.791" offset="4067108">Looking at the language of Section 924(c), we did not perceive any serious question about the meaning of the statute on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.131" offset="4104410">Indeed we do not understand petitioners today to say anything to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.128" offset="4124473">While its terms it applies to any felony for which a person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, the definition they claim includes all degrees of bank robbery and this case when argued before this Court 50 or 75 years ago, that clear language would likely have been not the starting, but the stop in place for an inquiry into congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.357" offset="4217364">The Court entered the rigid and vulnerable dictates to the 'plain meaning' rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.942" offset="4235754">Although, that rule no longer commands absolute allegiance, even today we think that the language of a statute must remain the most secured evidence of the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.217" offset="4280789">As Justice Jackson stated, it is the business of Congress to sum up its own debates in its legislation and where Congress is unable to do so clearly --</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.701" offset="4598752">Well, I think we are not necessarily relying, we are not suggesting that you could rely only on the language of 924 (c) in order to support this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.807" offset="4639189">In fact, we agree that one of the situations which Congressman Poff posed which would be other offenses set forth under Gun Control Act of 1968 itself, might be situations in which the Congressional intent was really not to impose punishment for 924 (c) and perhaps purchasing a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.214" offset="4720796">In other words, offenses that cannot be committed without a gun in the first place. However, we do not reach at that conclusion by reliance on what Congressman Poff said directly, but by the fact that what it seems to lead if somewhat awkward result to the fact that it does seem to go beyond the Congressional purpose in this case which is to attach some additional penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.059" offset="4812120">So we are doing it really by a construction of the statute in light of its overall purpose and the evils of which it was directed not simply by relying on one's statement by the sponsor's of the Bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.017" offset="5487960">Where however as we believe it is true in this case, the objects of the legislation are not complex the language is straightforward and the results of adherence to the language of the statute, or equally as reasonable if not more so than the results of departure from it, then it seems that the Court should exercise great caution when it proceeds past the language of the statute to the legislative history, and therefore, we believe it is very important to examine carefully the legislative history, essentially Congressman Poff's statement, the petitioners in this case find so compelling and to give it a proper place in the context, the passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.000" offset="5675937">This perhaps will direct more to Mr. Justice Marshall's question about what Congress intended to do in these situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.585" offset="5702268">We think its first appropriate in doing that to examine the purpose of the Gun Control Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.748" offset="5730899">In this context, there can be a little doubt that about the evils which prompted enactment of the Gun Control Act, the problem simply put was guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.205" offset="5772799">The Presidential Commission report published in February 1967, and considered by Congress in connection with the passage of several bills had set forth alarming figures on the use of guns to commit crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.916" offset="5823581">Figures that had worsened by the end of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.529" offset="5838001">For example the House Report on the Gun Control Act show that in the 13 months ending in September 1967, 50,000 people had been murdered or assaulted with guns and similar the number of robberies including bank robberies with guns had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.271" offset="5904979">The Senate Report using figures for all of the 1967 showed over 60,000 murders and assaults and over 70,000 robberies all committed with guns, an average of 150 armed assaults and 190 armed robberies each day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.936" offset="5963702">The House Report accompanying its version of the Gun Control Bill stated plainly that no civilized society can ignore the malignancy, which this senseless slaughter reflects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.790" offset="6015111">You might also note that this concern was not confined to the Congress itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.274" offset="6032979">The assassinations of Robert Kennedy and of Martin Luther King had mobilized public support for greater controls on firearms as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.722" offset="6066833">Indeed Senator Davidson (Ph) indicated that in one month alone he received over 100,000 letters favoring gun registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.142" offset="6100479">The overriding purpose of the Act therefore was to take strong majors to inhibit the use of firearms in serious crimes and those majors took two principle forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.569" offset="6142170">First, greater federal controls over the sale and shipment of guns, provisions that are not an issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.602" offset="6298383">Well, I think the purpose is identical if you assume that there is no purpose to add increased deterrence to something true and I think that the statistics show that the most commonly used weapon to commit murder is also a gun, but this I do not think anybody would dispute that because the statute would also add a penalty to that crime, that it should be read not to include coverage of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.406" offset="6409560">The second measure that the Congress used to attack, increase crime by use of guns was simply increasing the penalties for the use of the firearms in serious crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.869" offset="6459402">We do think it is significant. Every Court of Appeals that has placed principle emphasis on the language in purpose of Section 924 (c) has concluded that it is available to convict and punish bank robbers also subject to punishment under Section 2113 (d).</text>

            <text syncTime="2469.860" offset="9959392">Well, we are talking about that in this particular case, but Congressman Poff in fact fact was talking about something more than that, because he said that his statute would not only be inapplicable to the bank robberies under Section 2113, but certain other robberies, including armed robberies of the mails and also to virtually all armed assaults under all of the federal assault statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.748" offset="10054895">So that in order to accept his version of 924 (c) you would have to believe that though Congress was very concerned about the rise in crimes, including armed robberies and armed assaults, that it deliberately enacted legislation which would not apply to federal armed robberies, most of them or some, at least bank robberies and mail robberies or federal assault which does not strike me as making much sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.625" offset="10166386">We have also pointed out in our brief that the other amendments introduced on this subject do not make any such distinction between felonies that already have a penalty for use of a dangerous weapon put into them in the House Congressman Casey had introduced an amendment, putting substantial additional penalties on persons who used a gun during certain federal crimes, including robbery and assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.990" offset="10267846">So far from exempting bank robberies and armed assaults, the Casey Amendments specifically included them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.188" offset="10292714">In the Senate, Senator Dominick introduced a bill which impose similar penalties for use of guns in any federal crime of violence and that was defined specifically to include assault with a dangerous weapon and robbery and Senator Dominick was fully aware that there were statutes which already provided increased penalties such as 2113 (d) and said that his amendment was not intended to detract form or repeal those provisions, but would be available to prosecutors, in addition to them for stronger penalties if they so desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.487" offset="10449867">Now, the Casey Amendment was replaced by the Poff Bill and then in conference committee, the Poff Amendment was used rather than the Dominick Amendment, but there is no indication anywhere that the House and Senate as a whole or the conference committee of which Congressman Poff incidentally was not a member deliberately endorsed an effort to immunize serious federal crimes, certain serious federal crimes and the remedy set forth in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.518" offset="10565955">In fact, given the overall purpose of the Gun Control Act and given the apparent common understanding of the Poff Amendment and the alternatives in the House and Senate, it is difficult to conceive a language that would express more clearly an intent, restraint for the laws relating to the use of guns in all federal felonies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.539" offset="10838046">As we have indicated in other statutes even within 2113 (d), the governing felony statute, the larceny statute would provide for much lower penalty than 20 years which is the 2113 (a), so by adding on the additional penalty, you do not really get up to the same place that you would under 2113 (d).</text>
