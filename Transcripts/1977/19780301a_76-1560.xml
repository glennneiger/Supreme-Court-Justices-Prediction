            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="134.186" offset="536660">I -- I would -- I don't know, Mr. Justice, but let me explain the reason I say it's the principle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.457" offset="557767">In addition to this issue, a single judge on the Court of Appeals, two of them, each individually found three other grounds for reversing this conviction in the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.294" offset="609176">One of the judges thought that the instructions were defective in two respects because they failed to specify what was necessary to be shown in order to establish the participation of particular defendants in the conspiracy and also that the instructions were deficient on withdrawal from the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.466" offset="677825">Another judge, although not agreeing with those two rulings, sought that the jury had coerced a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.249" offset="700918">So that what you have in this case is the Robinson-Patman Act issue concurred in by two judges of the Court of Appeals, other criminal law rulings concurred in by only one judge of the Court but the two single judges together ended up with a majority that would have resulted in reversal apart from the Robinson-Patman Act question.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.920" offset="783673">The indictment in this case, which was returned in December 1937, charged six corporations that manufactured gypsum board and ten of their individual officers with having conspired from before 1960 until the return of the indictment in violation of Section I of the Sherman Act to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize prices of gypsum board to fix, maintain, and stabilize the terms and conditions of sale and to adopt uniform methods of handling and packaging, two of the corporations and seven of the individual pleaded nolo contendere.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.401" offset="941558">After a 19-week trial, the jury convicted the four remaining corporations and the three individual offices of those corporations who are the respondents before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.205" offset="988787">I'd just like to say a word about the gypsum board industry itself because the character of the industry is significant with respect to the issues involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.202" offset="1028807">A gypsum board has largely replaced plaster as the major material used for the interior walls of buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.359" offset="1061407">Now, the gypsum board, the standard board produced by all manufacturers is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.146" offset="1080529">You can't tell it one from the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.265" offset="1088993">And as a result of this, the competition among manufacturers of gypsum board is not stressed quality, but rather price, discounts, and service.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.290" offset="1133087">The product is a heavy product, which means that shipping costs are extensive and it's difficult to serve a very large area from a particular plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.054" offset="1172167">The respondents have plants throughout the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.292" offset="1189094">The industry is also highly concentrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.291" offset="1201110">During the period covered by this indictment, the four corporate respondents had 75% of national sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.777" offset="1231099">They've been the four largest in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.097" offset="1240294">The eight largest in the industry had a total of 94% of the -- of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.247" offset="1260983">The remaining 6% of the industry was held by seven firms of the so-called “single-plant producers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="321.938" offset="1287732">A firm that had only one plant and of necessity would serve a much smaller geographical area than the nation companies could serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.653" offset="1322527">These companies came into existence in the 1950s and 1960s and one of the charges in our complaint, which we believe the records supports, is that part of the defendants' conspiracy involved predatory practices directed against the single producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.825" offset="1387207">The indictment charged that the defendants had utilized a number of different means for effectuating the conspiracy and the one that was most litigated in this case was a practice that the defendants referred to as verification.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.305" offset="1453140">Under this practice, when an official at the headquarters of one of the companies was informed from the field that a customer had been “a lower price by a competitor,” he verified with the company that was reported as giving this price.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.885" offset="1535478">If the other company denied giving the price, then they normally would not need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.879" offset="1559510">If, however, the other company acknowledged giving the price, then the usual, but not the invariable practice, was for the first company to meet that price.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.435" offset="1601724">The product was sold at a list price with a discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.144" offset="1620532">The list prices throughout the period were virtually identical by all the manufactures and the -- discussion of verification related primarily to the discounts that would be given off these prices.</text>

            <label>Mr. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="446.514" offset="1786044">I -- I couldn't state without knowing more fact, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, but, and this we think is the critical thing in this case, the charge was and the jury by its verdict must have found that verification if done with either the purpose or the effect of fixing prices would be enough to violate the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.582" offset="1862322">That -- that's -- our case is not limited just to the mere act of the verification because there's a lot more.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.919" offset="1883638">Let me add two things and addition to the verification.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.154" offset="1892519">It was not only with respect to prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.900" offset="1903595">It was also with respect to various terms and conditions of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.344" offset="1917283">For example, I would call to ask whether somebody was giving greater credit terms than they were giving.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.190" offset="1940689">In some instances, they call to ask whether firms with trucking the product to the customer because trucking is more convenient if it's delivered right to your plant than if you have to pick it up at the rail site.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.898" offset="1987500">And there are instances in which the inquiry related, not just to what was being done with respect to a specific customer but more broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.496" offset="2017907">What were you doing in a particular city?</text>
            <text syncTime="506.259" offset="2025012">Is it true you're doing certain things in Texas and so on?</text>
            <text syncTime="510.962" offset="2043820">The primary justification that the respondents offered for this practice was that they say the need to comply with the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.400" offset="2085512">Now, the Robinson-Patman Act, of course, prohibits generally discriminations in price whose effect may be substantially to lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.051" offset="2124173">It provides a limited exception in 2 (b) which says that, “A person charged with discrimination may justify it by showing that he gave the lower discriminatory price and a good faith attempt to meet the equally low price of a competitor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="547.850" offset="2191360">The respondents also contended that they needed to engage in this practice in order to protect themselves against what they called “customer fraud.”</text>
            <text syncTime="556.851" offset="2227304">The customer fraud as they see it being that a customer misrepresented to them that the custom was getting a lower offer from one of the competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.712" offset="2266802">But at the trial, there were a number of admissions that at least one purpose of this verification was to minimize price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.518" offset="2310060">As one officer of United States Gypsum stated, he said, “I was attempting to minimize deviations from list price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="585.169" offset="2340676">That's at page 501 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.801" offset="2351125">It's described as another method of keeping prices up, at page 519, to keep market stability, to guard against price erosion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="597.121" offset="2388428">One of these single-plant producers joined in this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.101" offset="2408385">He did so after he had attended the first meeting of the Gypsum Association, the trade association at which Mr. Respondent Watt, the executive vice president of U.S. Gypsum Company, said there were certain things that went on in the Gypsum industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.437" offset="2469721">Specifically, he talked about the exchange of price information and the need to be honest.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.088" offset="2492291">And this man stated that after he had been told that, the reason he engaged in verification was, and this is at 205 of the record, the price in our prime market was rapidly deteriorating and my motive was to try to keep it from deteriorating any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.875" offset="2555402">Now, during the time of this conspiracy --</text>

            <text syncTime="666.981" offset="2667833">And our argument on that score primarily is that because this exchange of prices tends to facilitate price maintenance, price stabilization, and price fixing to permit this would create a serious loophole in the Sherman Act, and this is designed to show that the defendants themselves at least recognize and to show what the -- one of the purposes was.</text>

            <text syncTime="802.622" offset="3210449">But I -- I think one thing, I may be just mention, in connection with the verification practices rather interesting, the major reason that was suggested, they needed to engage in verification was so they can protect themselves for a meeting competition defense if they were charged with price discrimination, but they kept no records at all of these communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.514" offset="3289966">They kept no records.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.434" offset="3293727">Indeed, there were policies not to keep records and when one man was asked, “Well, if you needed this for -- in order to protect yourself to establish a Robinson-Patman meeting-competition defense, why didn't you keep any records?”</text>
            <text syncTime="834.507" offset="3337927">He said, “Well, I can't really answer to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="838.117" offset="3352451">So, I think that, again, is illustrative of the dangers in this kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.546" offset="3374184">Now, during the period in November and December 1965, following the lead of U.S. Gypsum, all of the respondents announced that they were giving up discounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.465" offset="3429773">They were all going to sell at less prices, identical less prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.332" offset="3465300">And despite the fact that they were not giving any discounts at this period, they still continued to verify.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.804" offset="3495184">And the lack of discounting and the increased prices took place at a time when there was a decreased in demand for the product and over capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.231" offset="3552862">The Court gave a lengthy charge to the jury and explained at length the Robinson-Patman Act and what the meeting competition defense involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.613" offset="3602390">And what the Court told the jury was that they could convict the defendants if they found either a purpose to fix and stabilize prices or that the effect of what the defendants had done was to fix those stabilized prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.332" offset="3661322">And it said, “If the effect of such exchanges was to fix -- raise, fix, maintain or stabilize prices, then an agreement to engage in such in exchange is a violation of the Sherman Act, regardless of the specific purpose that the parties to the agreement had in mind.”</text>

            <text syncTime="959.743" offset="3838955">But over pages 17 -- page 1722 of the record, after they gave that instruction, the Court charged, “If the effect of such exchanges,” and this is about five lines down, “was to raise, fix, maintain, or stabilize prices, then an agreement to engage in such an exchange is a violation of the Sherman Act, regardless of the specific purpose that the parties to the agreement had in their minds.”</text>
            <text syncTime="992.273" offset="3969045">Therefore, and then goes on in the next paragraph, “The effect was to stay within the parties are presumed as a matter of law who've intended that results.”</text>
            <text syncTime="998.378" offset="3993496">So the Court charged the jury that they could convict if they found that the effect of this -- at first, that they had to find there was an agreement, and if they found that was an agreement, if they found that the effect of this agreement was to raise, maintain, or stabilize prices that was enough to establish a violation of Section I of the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1291.369" offset="5165453">There have been cases which have upheld them, there have been cases which have turned them down and said that the exchange of price information was not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.770" offset="5207040">But I think the one thread that runs through all of these cases and culminates in this Court's decision nine years ago in the Container case was that an exchange of current prices, which is what this was, how much they were offering to a particular customer, than an exchange of current prices violates the Sherman Act if either its purpose or its effect was to fix a stabilized or maintain the pricing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.518" offset="5402018">I think the disagreement between the majority and the minority over what the Government had proved in the case, not over the guiding legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.365" offset="5433365">And I think this principle reflects the economic realities of what happens when you have this kind of an exchange of price information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.321" offset="5481221">There is very little incentive for one firm to cut its prices if it knows that as soon as it does so, its opponent, its competitors will know about it because as soon it is reported by a customer that the price has been cut, the salesman, wanting to make a sale, will try to get approval from the home office to make the cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.810" offset="5575158">He will have to say who the competitor was that gave the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.190" offset="5588741">The firm, getting this request, will make -- get in touch with the other firm to see whether they did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.750" offset="5610998">Well, this it seems to me -- and correspondingly, you know that if you are giving them price information, they are giving you price information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.552" offset="5642136">It seems to me this removes a great deal of the incentive for engaging in price competition because price competition is effective, it is effective when what you have is a first price and it's tried to be done secretly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.613" offset="5702426">If -- if your course remained relatively steady, the only reason to cut a price is in the hope of gaining greater volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.206" offset="5728758">You make up in your volume what you lose in the individual sale, but if you know that everyone is going to follow suit, it is no great incentive to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.923" offset="5759687">And similarly, this kind of verification of prices is a very effective method of policing, of policing an agreement to fix prices because you know that if you deviate from the agreement you will be caught up on it very quickly and the record shows numerous instances where that kind of thing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.359" offset="5845368">Now, the Container case, we think is very close to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.277" offset="5869087">There you had a similar situation that the companies reciprocally exchanged their most recent prices on sales to specific customers without even considering the purpose of this arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.196" offset="5916735">The Court held the price -- this arrangement was illegal price-fixing because it said it stabilized prices though at a downward level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.955" offset="5951739">The inferences are irresistible that the exchange of price-information has had an anticompetitive effect in the industry, chilling the vigor of price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.936" offset="5995729">The Court of Appeals decision and respondent's argument in this case as to why they should have this exception rest on two words, literally two words in the Container opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.658" offset="6046616">The opinion in Container began to -- by explaining why this case is unlike any other price decisions we have rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.209" offset="6080784">And then it distinguished Container from other cases, and it distinguished among other cases the Cement Manufacturers case which had upheld an exchange of price information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.606" offset="6122371">And it's noted that while both cases involved an exchange of prices to specific customers, there was absent to controlling circumstances, this, the Cement Manufacturers price exchanges were designed to protect against fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.954" offset="6183811">And the Court of Appeals and the respondents urged that because this Court, in distinguishing the case used the word “controlling circumstance,” this amounts to a recognition of an exception to the general rule condemning the exchange of price information that has an adverse effect on competition if there is a controlling circumstance that will justify an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.915" offset="6275657">And then they go and say, “In here, we had a different -- another controlling circumstances, that which to protect themselves from being charged with price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.967" offset="6771775">What Container held was that the exchange of price information there, similar to that that you have here, was an illegal price tampering of price fix and price stabilization under the Sherman Act because of its effect upon prices, because of its effect in prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.781" offset="6851082">There is nothing in the Robinson-Patman Act that says that in order to establish your good faith in giving a discriminatory lower price to show that it was done in good faith to meet the equally low price of a competitor, you've got to check with the competitor to find out how much he is charging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.564" offset="6934256">The Federal Trade Commission does not take that position and they -- it is attached to our petition, the letter they sent us advising that and we know of no court cases that take that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.302" offset="6981172">They ruled that the Court of Appeals -- the principle the Court of Appeals has announced and the principle for which the respondents are arguing here, it seems to us, would cut a very wide gap in the Sherman Act because it's not difficult for people who want to facilitate the maintenance of prices to say they have to do it in order to protect themselves against -- protect themselves from a possible charge under the Robinson-Patman Act because the Robinson-Patman Act, they talk about meeting the requirements of 2 (b) of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.030" offset="7112098">The Robinson-Patman Act, the only requirements of the Robinson-Patman Act are that you cannot discriminate in price where it has anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.128" offset="7144490">2 (b) is a limited exception to that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.968" offset="7155775">It is a defense recognizing a specific situation, but it has never been thought, it seems me, that in order to take advantage of a defense like that, you can justify something that otherwise would violate another statute and that is precisely what happens in this case because the claim is that even though this thing has the prohibited effect upon competition, even though this exchanged, has had the effect of stabilizing or fixing prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.638" offset="7274475">Nevertheless, they can justify it because they want this information in order to defend against a possible charge of price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.159" offset="7316584">Now, the argument has been made here that to subject the respondents to conviction for this conduct amounts to a prohibited retroactive application of a new rule of law, we don't think there was any new rule of law that was applied by the District of Court in this case, we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.874" offset="7391399">So I've indicated that principles governing this field are well settled and all the District Court did was to tell the jury to apply these principles to the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.824" offset="12103262">And those cases stand for the proposition that you must find in a price exchange because we have a circumstantial case on the base of price exchanges you must find that the reason for exchanging prices was for the purpose of fixing prices or an anticompetitive purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3458.068" offset="13832255">Two of those deal with the charges of the Court with reference to conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.252" offset="13856914">The third deals with the subject of the hung jury or jury coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.454" offset="13889724">To deal with the instructions, it is important to recall as Justice Powell pointed out -- Mr. Justice Powell pointed out earlier, “The Government here charged a 13-year nationwide conspiracy involving all told some 12 defendants and some 160 coconspirators.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.435" offset="13977704">And this fits with a current proclivity if we might call with that of the antitrust division in any of the nationwide price-fixing cases that are brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.467" offset="14017829">If you'd look at the cases brought within the -- the last 10 years, you'll see the average duration of the alleged conspiracy is approximately 10 years, five more than the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.949" offset="14071745">The Government's brief as you all have seen contains what is really in their factual statement, a hodgepodge of separate episodes which they refer to as subsidiary agreements, subsidiary to some overall price-fixing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.381" offset="14157427">And these with the exception of a couple of pages out of the 44 are all agreements which were alleged to have occurred back prior to the beginning of the statutory period, prior to December 27, 1948 which is five -- I'm sorry 1968 which is five years prior to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.631" offset="14246452">To illustrate, included in their hodgepodge are a -- are the -- are transaction concerning applicator discounts in Oregon and Washington in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.414" offset="14309564">Another “subsidiary agreement” is a transaction concerning the withdrawal of wooden pallets in Michigan in 1971, and a third concerns alleged predatory pricing back in 1962 in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.981" offset="14383856">You have to realize there is such a hodgepodge in order to understand the need for the instruction which we sought and did not get in this case from the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.078" offset="14432235">And that was an instruction not just as he did charge that the jury would have to determine first whether there was an overall conspiracy; and second, whether each individual separately as each -- whether that individual joined the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.083" offset="14500258">But as the Second Circuit recognized in the Borelli case on, which we modeled our requested instruction, it was necessary with all these separate and distinct episodes that were placed before the jury over this 30-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.280" offset="14561071">It was necessary for something more to be said so that jury could not draw from the fact that an individual participated, for instance, in something to do with applicator discounts in 1965 in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.410" offset="14621571">They could not draw from that alone the fact that -- that that individual joined some vast overall conspiracy but rather they would be required to look at the situation of that individual and what his understanding was of what he was doing and what he was joining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.645" offset="14698580">We did not get such an instruction as was requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.579" offset="14718224">And the prosecution dismisses this as a semantical nicety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.461" offset="14745809">That's the language which they picked up from Judge Weis' dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.834" offset="14763259">But is it really?</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.968" offset="14767856">If you're going to convict individuals in a case such as this a semantical nicety to require that they really know and understand what is this conspiracy that I'm charged with before they can be convicted of it because that is really what we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.578" offset="14842253">I submit the prosecutions claim as semantical nicety is really a cynical disregard of the whole jury system as we know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.771" offset="14883004">And then the prosecution in order to get rid of the Borelli case says, “There were -- there was either one overall agreement or none and the subsidiary episodes were simply manifestations of the conspiracy in action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.039" offset="14964088">They could not have taken place without an umbrella agreement or understanding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.609" offset="14986344">Yet they never explained nor was it ever argued why there had to be some single overall umbrella understanding in order for two or three individuals to do something about applicator discounts on the west coast or about pallets in Detroit or to bring it down more specifically to the case of the Defendant Colon Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.126" offset="15084460">There was only evidence as Judge Hunter points out in his opinion of his involvement in some transactions about price and credit in 1965 and 1966 and Judge Hunter side comments that's really all the evidence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.248" offset="15148931">What is there to suggest that Colon Brown, an individual defendant here, knew from whatever the jury may have deduced he did back in '65 and '66, that he was joining some price-fixing or price verification conspiracy that continued on up into '68, '69, '70, and '71.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.973" offset="15239837">Indeed, Judge Zirpoli in the companion civil case held that whatever conspiracy may have existed in '65 and '66 was fully terminated and abandoned by 19 -- by January 1, 1968, long before the statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.403" offset="15313607">Likewise, as to Defendant Nicely, his -- the evidences to him concern almost entirely one sales call in Texas in 1962, but the jury was never told.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.640" offset="15366478">Did Mr. Nicely join this overall conspiracy, the one with which we were charged?He never told to focus on what Mr. Nicely's understanding was when he made that phone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.316" offset="15413185">And we contend that we were entitled clearly to such an instruction on the scope and purpose and the knowledge of the individual who allegedly joined the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.710" offset="15466789">The other aspect of the instructions concerns withdrawal, and on that, the charge is so brief that it's easy to understood, I think, if I reach -- it's -- the Court said simply, “In order to find that a defendant abandoned or withdrew from a conspiracy prior to December 27, 1968, you must find from the evidence that he or it took some affirmative action to disavow or defeat its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.482" offset="15585907">Mere inaction would not be enough to demonstrate abandonment,” and so far, we have no quarrel with that charge, we agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.873" offset="15615478">The Court went on to withdraw, a defendant either must have affirmatively notified each other member of the conspiracy, he will no longer participate in the undertaking, so they understand they can no longer expect his participation or of -- or acquiescence or he must make disclosures of the illegal scheme to law enforcement officials.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.790" offset="15703144">Now, the Government hardly recognizes that isn't the law, that isn't the law as it's been declared by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.994" offset="15731879">A defendant is not a member -- an alleged member of a conspiracy is not limited to just two ways, notify all the other members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.821" offset="15763226">Here are some 160 or go to the cops if I could use that expression, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.295" offset="15789140">You can disavow participation in a conspiracy by conduct, but the Court ruled that out.</text>

            <text syncTime="4222.693" offset="16890671">The jury started his deliberations on Tuesday, July the 8th at about five o'clock in the afternoon and deliberated from nine in the morning until ten at night, daily, Tuesday -- (Inaudible) Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.115" offset="16952424">As the judge questions, asks about exhibits, requests for further instructions, it was a very active, lively jury, and that went on until Friday when we got worried that there was something about the juror's health that was -- the judge called us into a meeting, we met with the foreman of the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="4316.938" offset="17267670">It starts at page 1837, even that portion where the judge interrogates the jury foreman in the final session after he has been told by notes from a jury that they could only decide on the basis of compassion for fellow jurors after he's been told, “No testimony, no document would change their views.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.978" offset="17355860">They were hopelessly deadlocked.</text>

            <text syncTime="4349.492" offset="17397864">When he finds that it won't help, that both of them abandoned that effort, the judge did as we contend in our brief coerced verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="4379.533" offset="17518132">I think it would be helpful to bring this down to the brass tax of the individuals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.307" offset="17541224">A man like Andrew Watt, an executive of this company could, under the instructions given by the trial judge, be convicted of a crime where his sole purpose was to comply with the law and where it was reasonable for him to believe that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.881" offset="17619487">Now, Mr. Watt went with USG in the early 1960s.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.961" offset="17635788">The company was the subject of many Robinson-Patman suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.157" offset="17652611">He was instructed by the lawyers hired by his employer that if he didn't comply with the Robinson-Patman Act, he can lose his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.593" offset="17690331">He was told that price verification was for the purpose of complying with the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.810" offset="17707154">He was told that it was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.280" offset="17717081">He complied with that advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.273" offset="17728993">Container came down in early 1969 within a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.609" offset="17746338">From the time Container came down, Mr. Watt talked to his lawyers again and sent a letter to everybody in US Gypsum and said, “Don't verify anymore on any products.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.774" offset="17787089">He himself had stopped from in gypsum some months earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.049" offset="17804121">His conduct in verifying was upheld by a federal district judge after a full trial in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.538" offset="17830139">Since that time, three Courts of Appeals, the Ninth Circuit including Judge Lumbard sitting from the Second Circuit, the Third Circuit, and the Tenth Circuit have all in one way or another approved the concept of complying with the Robinson-Patman Act as a -- an exception or whatever you want to call it as not a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.899" offset="17915507">Mr. Watt was indicted and convicted for conduct that eight appellate judges thought was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.967" offset="17951765">Mr. Watt, I represent him at trial tendered the only instruction at that time that had ever been approved by any reviewing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.477" offset="17985829">We have no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.483" offset="17989904">That was the only law we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.123" offset="18000457">The Ninth Circuit said in the Gray case that it was plausible under existing law for an individual to believe that verification was required to conform with Robinson-Patman obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.330" offset="18053224">It was a fact issue for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.813" offset="18063151">Now, if the Ninth Circuit thought that it was plausible in 1972 to believe that you were complying with the Robinson-Patman Law in verifying, how could Mr. Watt or his lawyers believe to the contrary?The trial court said that it would give the substance of that instruction but it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.930" offset="18131696">Marks versus United States, decision of this Court says that, “Persons have the right to fair warning that their conduct -- fair warning of the kind of conduct that gives rise to criminal penalties.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.624" offset="18186449">Individuals have that right and this Court said it's a fundamental constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.145" offset="18208496">If all of those appellate court judges both couldn't perceive that Robinson-Patman verification was unlawful, how could Andrew Watt have fair warning?</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.958" offset="18255830">With regard to the other issues, it seems to me that the Government has made a -- quite a concession in its reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4584.042" offset="18336078">Now, I don't know think -- I think that the facts are much stronger than that concession because I think you can look at what the foreman said and what the jury was saying and it's easy to conclude that the jury was convinced that a deadlock was not acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.708" offset="18394802">But the Government conceives that the trial judge told the foreman that he preferred a verdict to a hung jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="4882.638" offset="19530501">First, three times before this meeting with the foreman, the Court specifically instructed the jury that while he would like him to come to a verdict, then they should reexamine their beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.751" offset="19582955">They should not give up a belief consciously held either because the views of other jurors or because of their wish to reach a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.277" offset="19617019">This in effect is a modification of the Allen charge that the Third Circuit has developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.626" offset="19634469">So, the jury was told repeatedly, they were not to surrender their independent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.354" offset="19661322">Secondly, after the foreman returned to the jury, as far as we can tell, the jury deliberated for about eight hours longer before coming to a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.863" offset="19707402">The juror -- the jury would turn to its deliberations at 12:04.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.724" offset="19730808">We assume they deliberate at that day until 6 or 6:30, they -- it only began at 8 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.743" offset="19750870">They brought in the verdict at 10:45 the next day.</text>
