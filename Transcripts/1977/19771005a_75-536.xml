            <label>Mr. Charles K. Wray</label>
            <text syncTime="72.475" offset="369838">Mr Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.195" offset="380705">I am here today representing the petitioner Nashville Gas Company in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.988" offset="399931">This case present for consideration by the court the question of whether certain employment policies of the Nashville Gas Company which treated pregnancy differently from the treatment afforded in sickness and accident constitute unlawful sex discrimination and violation of Title VII of Civil Rights Act 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.259" offset="476940">As such it is a sequel, I believe to the case General Electric Company versus Gilbert decided by this court in December last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.440" offset="513720">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals ruled against my client on the issues here presented essentially on the grounds that since only women became pregnant and they were treated differently from employees suffering from sickness and accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.696" offset="582683">Generally that was sex discrimination, unlawful sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.834" offset="599297">I submit that, that rationale was rejected by this court in the General Electric case, both the lower court decisions preceded, this court's decision in General Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.015" offset="644019">Thus I think we are here today to determine whether the holding and the underlying rationale of General Electric extend to the factual situation presented by this case which are admittedly somewhat different from the factual situation of the General Electric case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.011" offset="711937">There are really two factual circumstances involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.213" offset="732835">The first is that the Nashville Gas Company has a sick leave policy wherein it permits employees a certain number of days of absence with pay from covered sickness and accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.751" offset="786961">This plan differs from the General Electric plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.874" offset="803470">In that seniority is an element of the number of sick leave days to which the employee is titled. That almost is not present in General Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.107" offset="836385">Also the gas company policy has a specific exclusion for illnesses brought about by the employee's willful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.751" offset="874941">In this case Mrs. Satty, the plaintiff, had been an employee of the gas company for several years at the time she became pregnant when she was no longer able to work, she was placed on pregnancy leave and was -- had she been absent as a result of sickness or accident rather than pregnancy she would have been paid for a portion of the time that she was absent from work.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.663" offset="986536">The other factual circumstantial issue here is the company's treatment of seniority for job bidding purposes as it reflects pregnancy leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.776" offset="1031049">When Mrs. Satty went on pregnancy leave, the company was contemplating converting certain of the clerical functions in the department of which she was employed, too computive and as a consequence it was decided that the job that she had held would not be filled, that the job would be abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.857" offset="1115372">Thereafter, when Mrs. Satty was able to return to work after the birth of her child, she was given a temporary job by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.043" offset="1144107">That job lasted approximately one month and at the end of that time the temporary work was completed. During that month she beared on three permanent job openings with the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.840" offset="1199278">Now, in each case the job was awarded to another employee, another female employee, I might add.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.147" offset="1236476">His initial date of hire was more recent than Mrs Satty's but the company policy was such that when you had been absent on pregnancy leave, you were not permitted to retain your previously accumulated seniority for job bidding purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.256" offset="1424976">They are certain employees of the company who are and I do not know to what extent the policy as applied to non union employees might be the same as negotiated for the union employees. I just do not know the answer to that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.931" offset="7239624">The respondents had today admitted that they did not believe that they should fire Mrs. Satty for getting pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.254" offset="7276927">They believe this would be a violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.395" offset="7289465">We believe the record is clear, that is what petitioner did and as a fact on Mrs. Satty was more devastating than they had just come out and said you are fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.905" offset="7339516">Instead they constructively terminated her and made it very hard for her to ever get back to Nashville Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.510" offset="7373998">Their policy of placing pregnant employees on pregnancy leave rather than sick leave had the following effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.119" offset="7408375">It caused Mrs. Satty immediately and forever and I believe that the record does reflect that it is forever that Mrs. Satty would lose all competitive seniority that she had previously earned. In the affidavit of Mr. Henson, who is the Vice President for personnel, he makes the very clear statement that an employee who is placed on pregnancy leave and returns to permanent employment retains seniority, she had previously cumulated for purposes of pension vacation but does not retains such seniority for the purpose of bidding on jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.289" offset="7565110">There is no qualifier in there about if she gets the job back, she gets her seniority back or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.181" offset="7588620">I think that we can take this plain language to mean that this is gone forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.496" offset="7609936">She can never retain the seniority if she is lucky enough to get a job with Nashville Gas Company, she has to work for three-and-a-half years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3413.533" offset="13734083">Yes Your Honor, in the few minutes that I have remaining I would like to use that time to summarize our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.076" offset="13776192">In striping Mrs. Satty seniority, the gas company put her in the position of someone beginning new with the company as far as what we consider the important accruements of her job were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.167" offset="13828646">She was at the bottom of the seniority scale, she was at the bottom of the pay scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.646" offset="13850484">Once again, even though she had worked for them for three-and-a half years, this work meant nothing to the employer once she was placed on pregnancy leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.765" offset="13891026">They have changed her status from an employee with three-and-a-half year seniority to an employee with no seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.032" offset="13924045">As a result of this she lost three jobs which she bid on with the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.618" offset="13946406">The company concedes if she had had her previously accumulated seniority, she would have any or all of those jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.108" offset="13984336">She would presently be an employee of Nashville Gas company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.871" offset="13999382">Such a change of status is permanent we believe we have shown under the facts in this record and it is an impediment to Mrs. Satty's ever been rehired by the gas company and if she is rehired to her whole future advent, it will take her three-and-a-half years to return to the position she was in, prior to being pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.921" offset="14099588">In contrast to this we have employees who are sick or injured and out for considerable lengths of time in excess of the time that Mrs. Satty's was out, who not only retained their seniority and their rate of pay but actually accumulate seniority while they are on their sick leave and if any across the board raises are made during that time they get the advantage of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.286" offset="14233126">All of this was done by Nashville Gas company without a business necessity nor a reason which is consistent or able to stand logical scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.405" offset="14273563">They claim they want experienced employees, their sick pay policy shows they want experienced employees and yet there is a pool of experienced employees and women who become pregnant that they for no apparent reason to us at least shun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.326" offset="14353185">On sick leave is our position that when viewed in the total context of the companies entire policies toward pregnant women it is discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.598" offset="14398324">When this is done, when you look at this policy in light of their total policy toward women, you see that this is just the beginning step in the total policy designed to discriminate against pregnant women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.738" offset="14454853">Also, since there are finite number of sick days and it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3627.129" offset="14588496">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.628" offset="14598422">I submit that the the General Electric case controls here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.284" offset="14613051">General Electric stands for the proposition that a distinction based on pregnancy is facially neutral it is not per se sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.362" offset="14645338">It may nevertheless be unlawful, if the effect of the policy is to have disparate impact on women as a group as opposed to man as a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.197" offset="14684731">There is no evidence in the record to that fact and the plaintiff has the burden of proof on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.735" offset="14706883">It may also constitute unlawful sex discrimination if the policy is not in fact a pregnancy policy but a men versus women policy if it is a subterfuge, if it is not what it appears to be on its face, there is no evidence in this record that this policy is anything other than a straightforward pregnancy policy and there is nothing to suggest that the burden of proof has been shifted from the typical position of that burden being on the plaintiff and civil litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.993" offset="14819941">And for all of these reasons, I submit that the ruling of Court of Appeal should be reversed and the case dismissed.</text>
