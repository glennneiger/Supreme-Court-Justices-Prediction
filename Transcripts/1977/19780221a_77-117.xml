            <text syncTime="58.312" offset="233221">This case, here on Certiorari to the Fifth Circuit, is a government Civil Antitrust suit charging violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act against an agricultural cooperative, the National Broiler Marketing Association or NBMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.804" offset="299154">NBMA is a cooperative of producers of broiler chickens.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.205" offset="320784">The district court granted summary judgment for NBMA and dismissed the complaint on the basis of the Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.815" offset="355161">That Act grants a limited Antitrust Exemption to agricultural cooperatives composed of "persons engaged in agricultural production as farmers, planters, ranchmen, dairymen, nut or fruit growers".</text>
            <text syncTime="105.310" offset="421198">The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's decision because some of NBMA's members contract out the so called grow out phase of broiler production to independent contractors known as contract growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.026" offset="484101">The Fifth Circuit held that such a producer is not entitled to join an exempt cooperative.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.300" offset="525166">For example, it is not disputed that a broiler chicken is an agriculture product under the Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.333" offset="557244">Thus we are not concerned with producers of hotdogs or flour, refined sugar, textile products or other manufactured products.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.235" offset="3616914">They take the chicks to a grower, when the chicks are a day old, they haul the new born chicks â€“ well, more concretely to a poultry house and that is where the chickens are going to grow for 7 or 8 weeks until they are ready for slaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.661" offset="3694550">And this is the grow-out stage and a poultry house will house up to 45,000 chickens at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.142" offset="3732480">Sometimes the integrator, the producer, the member of the cooperative owns the poultry house themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.472" offset="3781799">More commonly the poultry house is owned by these contract growers, independent contractors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.574" offset="4030276">And at the end of the 7 or 8 weeks when they are mature, the integrator sends his employees to catch the birds, coop them and truck the cooped birds to the slaughter house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.210" offset="4080744">And these employees who catch and coop the birds like the field men who visit the grower weekly are as much farm labors, as the grower himself and is hired help.</text>

            <text syncTime="1291.361" offset="5165349">The problem that's happened with poultry production is that the attributes of a complete or traditional farmer have become divided between two entities; the grower has some, in the sense that he actually has the day to day custody of the birds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.234" offset="5232849">The integrator has, we would argue more or at least as many, because he bears the market risk, he markets the birds, he supervises them, he formulates their diet, he inoculates them and does many of the things which in traditional agriculture are the farmer's job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.775" offset="5323024">The Justice Department and the court below have said the only thing that counts in whether a firm is a farmer, is whether it has ownership of the land or custody of a crop, and we say that's just a rule to decide this case, can be very easily circumvented simply by rewriting the contract with the growers to designate them as employees and this Court has had experience with the difficulty of a rule which turns on the concept of title.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.664" offset="5498567">Yes, that would fall under the government's -- under the branch of the government's rule for which the person with custody is a farmer, and the person with title of the land is another farmer, thus the plantation owner and the tenant farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.839" offset="5559275">In the poultry case the ownership of the land, that is to say the land under the poultry house is in the grower and the custody is in the grower that really divided with the integrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.651" offset="5614550">But if these contracts with the growers were rewritten so that the growers become employees, then under the Justice Department's test, the integrated producers would become farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.295" offset="5669094">We have mentioned in our brief that the trend in poultry production is toward the complete integration of the operation under the integrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.734" offset="5718936">Two of the members of the cooperative grow a 100% of their own birds, 143%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.897" offset="5751536">Still most place most of their birds with outside growers and yet that is a situation that is changing in the direction of greater integration and if the Fifth Circuit's decision were upheld that would just give the producers an additional impetus to continue this trend of buying out growers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.005" offset="5935961">This is a case about statutory interpretation, about the statutory interpretation of a word in a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.541" offset="5974100">The central legal question in the case is whether integrators or contract producers, that do everything in this production of chicken except do the actual growing, who have divorced themselves from the actually farming of chickens, whether those integrators are nevertheless farmers within the meaning of the Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.477" offset="6081829">Now the importance of the case, it seems to me, lies in this single fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.843" offset="6107324">Reading the legislative history of this statute, the Congress, the 67th Congress in 1922, you come inevitably, it seems to me, to the conclusion that that Congress intended to safeguard actual farmers, farmers on the land and doing the tilling or shepherding of the crops and the flocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.093" offset="6212336">They did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.193" offset="6216725">They had that intention in order to safeguard the farmers against the middlemen, against the processors, against the marketers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.392" offset="6249535">And so the case really raises a familiar question, namely; are we to honor that original exemption; that original intention in a limited way focused on the fact situation that was presented by that Congress or whether we are now to interpret it in a somewhat more relaxed fashion?</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.401" offset="6497593">And so when Congress sought to fashion these words and to focus it's exemption, it did so, not so much because there was a risk of one kind or another, but because they saw farmers leaving the farms and going to the city.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Shenefield</label>
            <text syncTime="2433.544" offset="9734165">It seems to me that that's exactly correct, taking into account the concern that the Congress had for the farmers and their wellbeing as opposed to Mr. Armour and Mr. Swift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.314" offset="9781185">I was addressing just briefly the one opportunity that Congress had to confront a similar kind of problem to the situation we have here today, the Phipps Amendment, which is mentioned as I said on Page 15 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.759" offset="9854955">Senator Phipps in effect proposed an amendment to exempt activities of manufacturers or producers of agricultural products provided two things, provided they entered into pre-planting contracts and provided the farmer's compensation depended on the price of the agricultural commodity in the ultimate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.892" offset="9951504">Now when he talked of that amendment he spoke of several kinds of products that he thought -- several kinds of processors that he thought might be covered by it, milk was one, fruits, and vegetables.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.442" offset="10009704">The supporters of the Capper-Volstead Act were steadfastly opposed to the Phipps Amendment and it was defeated, but they were opposed, because it seemed to them that it went far beyond that narrow focus, that narrow concern that they had and it's instructive, that whole incident is instructive to us for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.717" offset="10102805">One, it was quite clear as the result of the debates that pre-planting contracts, the kind of arrangement for the sale of the crop in advance of planting was not sufficient to make those processors, farmers under the Capper-Volstead Act as that Congress sought even though that meant that the processors bore much of the risk of market fluctuation up and down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.257" offset="10201025">It also showed that the Congress thought an exemption or an amendment to the Bill then on the floor was required to exempt those persons, that the Capper-Volstead Act did not do it, and it was rejected precisely because it addressed the question of middleman and processors and sought to aid them and that was one of the things that Congress saw as the difficulty of the farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.175" offset="10296633">And so the defeat of the amendment is important, indeed it's regarded significant by this Court in the Case-Swayne opinion and the reasons for the defeat are crucial because in effect it shows that Congress wanted to narrowly focus the exemption as much out of concern for consumers down their distribution chain as out of concern for the farmers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.180" offset="10396630">Now the theme, the general theme of the language plus the legislative history was precisely the exercise of this Court went through in Case-Swayne which we regard as definitive in the explication of this amendment, this exemption and let me just call attention to three or four things in connection with Case-Swayne.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.600" offset="10494328">As we mentioned earlier, given the fact that two of the members of NBMA are neither hatchery owners nor breeder flock owners, or six of them are not, and two in addition do not own a feed processing plants, we went under Case-Swayne but we go beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.982" offset="10583876">Once you look at the reports, particularly House Report Number 24, which is sided in our Brief, the debates which are mentioned in our Brief and recounted in Case-Swayne, the Phipps Amendment which is set out in a footnote in Case-Swayne, you come, it seems to me inevitably to the conclusion that these kinds of processors, the processors that were orange processors in Case-Swayne and one similar to that in this case are not farmers within the Capper-Volstead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.977" offset="10723892">And then the conclusion that Case-Swayne reaches is particularly instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.352" offset="10749388">What it says is that you could, it seems to the authors of the opinion, expand the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.423" offset="10777600">You could interpret it broadly, but because the purpose of Congress in enacting the Capper-Volstead Act was to create a special exception to a general rule, to a general legislative plan, the exemption is to be narrowly construed and that is set out in full at 389 U.S. 384.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.639" offset="10870491">So we argue strongly that NBMA members are not farmers, because they do not meet the twin standards, ownership of the land or working at the land and if that is the determining standard, both in the language, producers of agricultural products as farmers, it's the determining standard in the legislative history, you simply cannot read the legislative history without getting that clear signal and it is the determining standard in cases in this Court that have construed that statute.</text>
