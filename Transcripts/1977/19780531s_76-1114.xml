            <text syncTime="22.880" offset="171430">The first three cases, the California against Southland, and two consolidated cases raise issues under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.140" offset="224510">Under that Section, the consent of the Commission, now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is required for the abandonment of any service rendered by certificated facilities carrying gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.666" offset="302564">The question in this case is whether upon the termination of the lease, under which the lessee has made a certificated sales in Interstate Commerce, the lessor must secure the consent of the Commission to terminate the interstate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.848" offset="399322">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said or held that the Commission had no power at all in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.420" offset="433594">We disagree and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit as we see it, Section 7 does reach a situation such as this under consent of the Commission must be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.605" offset="502349">This result we think is required by our cases, particularly Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Company case in 364 U.S. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.415" offset="557624">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion, and the Chief Justice, and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have joined Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.358" offset="593359">Justices Stewart, and Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
