            <text syncTime="15.918" offset="143647">In National Society of Professional Engineers against United States, the United States brought this civil antitrust suit against the Society, alleging that it's canon of ethics which prohibits members from submitting competitive bids for engineering services, suppressed competition in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.927" offset="227657">The Society defended on the ground that the canon was justified under the Rule of Reasons because it was adapted by members of a learned profession for the purpose of minimizing the risk, that competition would reduce inferior engineering work, endangering the public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.389" offset="297561">Without making any findings on the likelihood that competition would produce the dire consequences envisaged by petitioner, the District Court rejected this justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.892" offset="343536">The Court of Appeals affirmed and we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.240" offset="360882">On its face the canon restrains trade within the meaning of the Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.755" offset="383033">Under the Rule of Reason the proper inquiry is whether the challenged agreement is one that promotes competition or one that suppresses competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.409" offset="417620">The Rule does not supported a defense based on an argument that competition itself is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.646" offset="442593">Accordingly for reasons stated in full in an opinion filed with the clerk, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.194" offset="472686">Mr. Justice Blackmun filed an opinion in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist joined, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.744" offset="506958">The Chief Justice filed an opinion concurring in part and descending in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.170" offset="524617">Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
