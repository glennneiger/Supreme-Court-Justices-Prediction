            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="31.745" offset="206927">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.906" offset="219570">In this case, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed a decision by the Board of Appeals of The Patent Trademark Office which had sustained the patent examiners rejection of respondent’s patent claims as not constituting statutory subject matter within the meaning of Section 101 of the Patent Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.465" offset="329807">That was the sole ground for rejection of the claim for sole statutory issue before the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the only statutory section that is before the Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.761" offset="386963">At bottom, the Board of Appeals and the Court differed in their view of the scope and meaning of this Court’s decision in Gottschalk against Benson 409 US 63 which also involved reversal of the decision of the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.125" offset="484452">The legal principles at issue in the case are fairly straightforward and can be addressed I believe without detailed discussion of the technology to which the patent claims relate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.332" offset="553206">We have set forth some description of that in an Appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.418" offset="577552">Now, I should remind you of that the Benson case before I got to the facts of this case, involved a process, a patent claim just as this case involved a process patent claim and that in Benson, the claim was on a method of programming, a general purpose digital computer to convert signals from binary coded decimal form into pure binary form, another form of mathematical representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.738" offset="762917">The Court there pointed out a definition of the word 'algorithm' which crops up in these cases and which I seldom use in between these cases and have a tendency to forget what it means in between these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.955" offset="827701">The Court there defined an algorithm as a procedure for solving a given type of mathematical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.866" offset="863436">There are other possible definitions of algorithm but we are talking about mathematical algorithms.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.153" offset="900530">They are rather similar to formulas but they are not necessarily formulas.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.980" offset="919861">They can be expressed in other forms but they are procedures for solving a mathematical problem for calculating a number in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.516" offset="958000">The Court held that the procedures set forth in the claims in Benson are of that kind, a generalized formulation for programs to solve mathematical problems of converting one form of numerical representation into another in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.999" offset="1031874">Now, the present case similarly involves claim of novelty in a mathematical procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.746" offset="1078894">Here, it was a procedure to be applied to familiar technology in adjusting what are called the alarm limits that are imposed so that corrected action can be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.603" offset="1146290">Alarm limits on process variables which are changeable conditions in the process of catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons, a commercial process involved in hydro cracking and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.260" offset="1236988">The claims are set forth and I think we can turn to the claims on page 63a of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.645" offset="1270529">There are 10 claims altogether, all of which were rejected as not being statutory subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.457" offset="1309712">I should add that in one of the amicus presentations, some question is raised about whether the formula set forth in claim on the series of mathematical solutions is itself novel.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.286" offset="1385050">No such question was decided below.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.248" offset="1396961">We do not believe it is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.724" offset="1406783">In its present posture in this Court, we have to assume that the mathematical representations in claim one are novel.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.269" offset="1457043">That question would be open to the examiner on remand, should the decision below be sustained but nobody has decided it yet in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.155" offset="1536560">It is not necessary to get involved in the details of these equations.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.579" offset="1550248">I am just trying to point out what it is that the claims involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.835" offset="1567280">Claim one is the only independent claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.950" offset="1583685">Claims two through 10 are all dependent upon claim one and state claim one with certain end use limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.547" offset="1626108">However, none of those limitations involve any novelty that was the holding of the patent examiner and of both Courts below and as a matter of fact, this is admitted in the abstract that the respondents submitted along with his claim and perhaps the most telling point about this is that four of the additional claims two through 10 had originally been rejected, not only on Section 101 grounds by the examiner but also on Section 112 grounds as insufficient specifications to disclose to people familiar with the art, how to practice the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.389" offset="1821503">In a petition for rehearing, the respondent said, no, these are sufficiently disclosed because they are all conventional technology that are well known to practitioners of the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.344" offset="1873330">There is no reason to have to spell them out and he cited previous patents and other technical material to indicate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.189" offset="1920664">On page 44a of the appendix at the bottom, he sums it all up in saying that the means are conventional and well known in the art and therefore these specifications are adequate to meet the requirements of Section 112 and the examiner in response to this withdrew his objections under Section 11, so we have also collected on page 7 of our brief, various citations to the record which show that these claims do not add anything inventive or new in stating their end use limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.398" offset="2117523">They are in their function in this case, little different as we suggested in our brief from an attempt to patent the Pythagorean theorem about the relationship…</text>

            <text syncTime="880.078" offset="3600233">The whole thrust of the application was that you use the conventional methods that are now used in setting the alarm limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.840" offset="3635237">But by putting this mathematical formula into the computer, you can calculate the numbers more easily and then imply them in the ordinary way that the numbers are applied in the existing technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.154" offset="3696573">That is the essence of what the claim was and if we look at the setting forth of the claim on page 63a, there are four steps in claim one which is the only claim that is material to the argument as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.330" offset="3769193">The first is determining the present value and the description says you do that the way you do it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.036" offset="3800018">The claim does not try to fill in what the values would be of the process variables.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.789" offset="3823110">It depends on the process that you are operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.082" offset="3832201">You just go about it in your regular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.239" offset="3840873">Two and Three which have the formulas are the mathematical algorithm as it is defined in Benson and then number four is adjusting the alarm limit to the number that you calculated by means of steps two and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.140" offset="3924465">So four was added on and it is described as just doing what you would ordinarily do once you have the number and to use a very homely analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.785" offset="3975038">It says, if two and three were a claim for a process of a new way to put together cake ingredients and then another step was added after you have put the ingredients together that way, you put the cake in the oven and bake it.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.144" offset="4044524">That would be number four.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.088" offset="4052256">It is what you would ordinarily do with the number, the process of calculation and what is being done now with the numbers is they are calculated in the way that they have been calculated right along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.691" offset="4110666">There is no element of novelty in number four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.461" offset="4129788">But the question to use the cake analogy is whether if the new method of putting together the ingredients was not a patentable process, the fact that you added a fourth step saying and then after you have put them together, you put the cake in the oven and bake it, would transform that into something that would not be covered by the limitations of the Benson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.199" offset="4228739">That is really the way the question was put in the Board of Appeals and before the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in adjudicating the case and the decision in the Board of Appeals and by the examiner noted, I am lumping these two together for brevity, that once the number was calculated, no unexpected results were achieved by simply using the number in the way you would ordinarily use the number and for that reason granting the patent would in practical effect be a patent on the formula or the mathematics itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.510" offset="4429987">That was the holding because as the Board of Appeals said, the respondent proposes to use just the conventional automatic alarm adjusting equipment to implement the invention in the ordinary way so that the only element of novelty is the way of calculating the numbers according to these formulas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.795" offset="7919110">Enacting the patent statute the Congress made it clear in its first several sections of the statute, what its plan and pattern was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.741" offset="7946904">First in Section 100, the definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.390" offset="7961428">An invention is described there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.759" offset="7970937">It is defined with a circular definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.705" offset="7978774">Invention means discovery, but I think that Congress was attempting to say, invention means what we all know it to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.371" offset="8005419">It has just got its common English language meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.977" offset="8015868">That is different from patentable invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.812" offset="8023182">Now we must determine whether it qualifies for patenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.614" offset="8034362">In section 101, they said whoever invents or discovers may qualify for patenting if the nature of this subject matter falls within the certain defying categories and the Congress said a process, a machine, a manufacture, composition of matter, or improvements in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.392" offset="8101445">Now, the discoverer of a previously unrevealed natural principle simply does not qualify under those categories and no matter how he may attempt to express it if what he is seeking to patent is simply the discovery of this existing phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.670" offset="8166646">However, important that may be he cannot patent it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.681" offset="8178663">The example that we like to use, because it has a little bit of drama to it is Einstein’s E=mc2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.362" offset="8201337">An extraordinary discovery of the human mind, certainly it contributed immensely to science and its evolvement, but it simply would not be patentable under the patent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.631" offset="8246476">Now, let us suppose you attempt to patent E=mc2 by converting it into the sequence of steps of a process, but if the sum and substance of the process you have defined has no practical application except the solving of that equation to determine how much energy there is in a given quantity of mass, it is not patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.576" offset="8322232">What this Court said in Benson was to reestablish clearly and unmistakably that vital principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.143" offset="8352534">“He who discovers a hitherto unknown phenomenon of nature has no claim to a monopoly of it which the law recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.908" offset="8379596">If there is to be invention from such a discovery, it must come from the application of the law of nature to a new and useful result."</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.786" offset="8423064">If the commissioner suggests that there must be an inventiveness of implementation test, he applies a terribly discriminatory standard to an inventor who has discovered an old phenomenon but discovered it for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.407" offset="8485549">His task is far more difficult than the putterer in the laboratory who may just chance upon something and not have the faintest idea why it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.639" offset="8518463">If I can illustrate that, the inventor who understands and is the first to discover a phenomenon of nature, who ascertains and can set forth for the public knowledge and underlying scientific principle would be barred by his own implementation of that, however new his implementation might be because the patent office would say he is simply doing what would naturally evolve from the suggestion of the principle in effect, this is tantamount to claiming the principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.020" offset="8648031">Whereas one who did not know the principle did not discover it and attempted to define a use of it would not be so barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.337" offset="8681259">The inventiveness of implementation tests also disregards how to compare the inventor's contribution with the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.543" offset="8714068">The Congress said in the 1952 Act, it must not only be new and useful and an invention, but it must be an invention in patentable sense which we say to me according to the prior cases un-obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.339" offset="8781255">It must also in its usefulness not have been disqualified form patentability, so we have two additional sections; we have Section 102 that lists the disqualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.359" offset="8821379">If the subject matter had become known to the public in someway, if it is in a printed article, public use, on sale, no matter how inventive it may have been it maybe too late to get a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.756" offset="8866937">Hence, it is disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.491" offset="8873833">Under 103, we must now compare the invention assuming it is not disqualified with the prior art and focusing upon difference with regard to the invention as a whole, we must ascertain whether it would have been not obvious to one of ordinary skill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.133" offset="8936423">Here if the inventiveness of implementation test is applied rather than the practical effect doctrine of Benson, we have an inventor hoist on his petard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.003" offset="8975920">He is damned by his own discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.514" offset="8990026">He is not one of ordinary skill in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.524" offset="8997967">He is the discoverer and the inventor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.918" offset="9007580">If you say, well, he knew the basic underlying principle so his implementation would naturally follow, he is in a worse position than the man who did not discover the underlying principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.219" offset="9044779">This is not an appropriate standard to apply it and the correct standard is the 103 Standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.876" offset="13975443">Then it said, however ingenious the discovery of the underlying natural principle may have been in this case, the application of it is hardly more than an advance in the packaging of the inoculants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.807" offset="14031136">The application did not meet the standard of invention and the very last paragraph of the opinion says, we conclude that the product claims do not disclose an invention or discovery within the meaning of the patent statutes and at that time, Section 103 was not in the patent statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.330" offset="14113265">That was merely common law about obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.309" offset="14129148">What was in the patent statutes was that it must be an invention or discovery of a new and useful product and it was not because there was no novelty in the application of the phenomenon --</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.853" offset="14347322">If there is novelty in the end use and also novelty in an algorithm, that is part of the process, is the subject matter patentable in the government’s view?</text>
