            <label>Mr. Joseph A. Marino</label>
            <text syncTime="81.119" offset="324441">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.136" offset="332487">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.510" offset="349936">In this case the FCC has brought this case to you for review and from the judgment of the court below, an opinion in which the court split and their opinion with Justice Leventhal, that's dissenting in the hope of getting some clarification to the meaning of the word “indecent” as appears in the court -- in the criminal code 1464.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.401" offset="477518">The FCC has from beginning in 1970 tried to give some concrete meaning to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.770" offset="519001">The FCC recognized in the very first decision in 1970 that its opinion would of course be subject to the judicial review and it welcomed judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.625" offset="566439">This case came to the FCC on a specific compliant from a citizen in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.173" offset="592666">The case as it now is before the Court really raises two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.666" offset="618580">The first question of statutory construction is whether or not the “indecent” as that word appears in 1464 should be subsumed into the obscene as it has been in several other federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.983" offset="691931">On this issue both the FCC and the Department of Justice are in agreement and in their briefs before you argue, but it should not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.553" offset="738116">The Department of Justice in their brief makes a very little statutory analysis of the provision of 1464.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.955" offset="779807">It points out that the language, the clear language that Congress used is any obscene, indecent or profane, but this language was used in the disjunctive that Congress was obviously trying to reach even the use of one word which was either indecent, obscene or profane although we quickly added that the case we have before your deals not was obscenity but with indecency and if I could just back up and focus on the complaint that the Commission had before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.565" offset="962247">That complaint was filed from a prior listener in New York, a specific complaint which identified four words.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.924" offset="999654">Those words would be defined as verbal taboos and in fact Professor Holland, his text book and language and sought an action identifies them as verbal taboos and says that this usually deals with words having something to do with sexual or excretory organs.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.114" offset="1080424">And the words are amount in one judge has described them as verbal slaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.731" offset="1126922">So this specific complaint came to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.663" offset="1146567">It came to the Commission at a time shortly after this court's opinion in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.201" offset="1176764">It came to the Commission shortly after that the DC Circuit had affirmed its opinion in the Illinois Citizen case dealing with the question of obscenity and had recognized that the presence of children in the audience was a vital factor and this really was at the at the heart of the Commission's decision and it was at the heart of the complaint that the Commission had before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.009" offset="1283971">The listener pointed out that the words were broadcast at a time in the afternoon when a child could have been tuning the dial and would have come across those words, the listener pointed out that in fact he had a child with him in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.155" offset="1368607">And this really was we think at the heart of the Commission's decision when it came to the concept of indecency.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.386" offset="1405492">The Commission as the justice department correctly recognizes and points out took element D of the Miller case patently offensive, tried to give flesh to that element in a case where you are merely dealing with words, and individual words, and what it said is that we are dealing with when we construe the “indecent” is words which are patently offensive by contemporary community standards for the broadcast media which deal with sexual and excretory organs which are broadcast at a time of the day when there is a reasonable risk that children maybe in the audience and this is where the Commission took a new tack we believe and I think Judge Leventhal recognized this with regard to the place and with the indecency standard, it tried to channel these words out of time periods when there would be a reasonable risk of children being in the audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.280" offset="1709035">The case was appealed over the DC circuit which split.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.300" offset="1741113">We in our brief have called to your attention the opinion of Judge Leventhal.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.274" offset="1781029">We think that that opinion correctly construes the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.067" offset="1800255">As a narrow order, a declaratory order limited to the facts that the Commission had before it, that the complainant had brought to the Commission that many, that the order that was presented to the court as a flat band on these words that these words could not be broadcasted and it really a different times of the day but that the only -- that when it ruled on the complaint on itself, the Commission narrowed it to a link to the facts that it had before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.813" offset="1963154">It tried to accomplish two things with the declaratory order.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.238" offset="1976947">It tried to furnish a concrete definition of the world indecency and we must bear in mind that the justice department had told the court that the Commission could have read the “indecent” probation in the criminal statute as a flat band.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.816" offset="2055210">The Commission did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.397" offset="2081541">It then proceeded to analyze the complaint and the conflicting interest that -- and competing interest that words take here and central to those interests Your Honor was the recognition that this Court made in the Yoder Case that the parental interest in the upbringing of children is an important value.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.953" offset="2191778">That opinion the Commission found very helpful because of the fact that in the Yoder this Court not relied in that interest but also relied on the Ginsberg opinion where Mr. Justice Brennan had recognized this as similar interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.668" offset="2278609">The Yoder opinion was also instructive because it relied on at least cf. the Rowan case in which this Court recognized that in the certain circumstances people are captives in their own homes and that at that point they are entitled to privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.011" offset="2375993">Now the Commission's opinion really at the heart of the case was the attempt to protect children from these words, the Commission also tried to give some recognition to privacy rights of people on their home who would tune into a station and be confronted with these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.281" offset="2465123">We would point out that in a CBS versus DNC case this Court recognized that a radio listener is sort of – is in many ways the member of a captive audience and I think we have made our points Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.073" offset="2552268">If there are not further questions, I would save some time for rebuttal and be very happy to answer any questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.213" offset="2620813">The text that I refer, it is his text, professor Hayakawa's text on language inside an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.359" offset="2657384">There are two editions, there is at least I know of two editions, the 1949 edition is really interesting because it recognizes not only the verbal taboos that before you are dealing with sexual or excretory organs, but goes onto point out that at least at time in broadcasting over many more taboos that made it very hard for people to communicate but in the 70 Edition, he drops the reference to special taboos applicable to radio and identifies the ones that we think of before you.</text>
