            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="80013">We will hear arguments first this morning, in 76-1121 American Broadcasting Cos. against Writers Guild and the cases consolidated with that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.789" offset="143125">Mr. Come, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="28.960" offset="195788">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.295" offset="225149">This case presents another facet of the problem which this court considered in Florida Power fours years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.790" offset="267154">The question is whether Section 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labors Relations Act which makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain in course an employer in the selection of his representatives for collective bargaining or grievance adjustment whether union violates this provision by threatening to discipline and disciplining supervisors who are also members of the union for crossing a picket line to perform their normal supervisory duties during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.935" offset="415739">Now, the facts very briefly are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.382" offset="433502">Respondent at the Writers Guild represents for collective bargaining purposes, writers who prepare scripts for motion pictures and television films.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.660" offset="486583">The employers also employ producers, directors, and story editors to manage and carry out the production of the films.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.531" offset="522109">The producers, directors and story editors are supervisors within the meaning of the Act and when engaged as such they also represent the employers and the adjustment of grievances and the producers also represent them in some cases for collective bargaining purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.542" offset="602149">Some producers, directors, and story editors known as hyphenates and these are the people that we will be concerned with here have writing capabilities and are at times employed by the employers as writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.263" offset="665051">The Guild represents the hyphenates only when they are employed as writers and when they are employed as producers, directors, or story editors.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.398" offset="705593">Most hyphenates have personal service contracts with the employers when they are so engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.969" offset="731820">The collective bargaining agreement with the Guild provides that a person's subject employed in a non-writing capacity such as a producer, writer, or director is not covered by the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.069" offset="792215">The agreements further provide that producers, directors, and story editors may engage in certain editorial writing functions called "A to H" Functions without becoming subject to the agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.499" offset="849998">Now in March of 1973, the Guild began a strike against the employers in furtherance of their demands for new contracts covering the writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.842" offset="891376">The strike continued against some employers until July of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.032" offset="912065">A month before the strike started, the Guild distributed strike rules to all members including the hyphenates.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.623" offset="942472">In addition to prohibiting writing for struck employers, the rules prohibited all members regardless of the capacity in which they were working from crossing the union picket lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.639" offset="998478">The union strike rules also prohibited union members from working in the future with members who violated the strike rules and the Guild through a special meeting of the hyphenates and the phone calls to particular hyphenates emphasized that the strike rules would apply to the hyphenates working in any capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.535" offset="1086145">And that they would be subject to discipline and blacklisting if they crossed the picket lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.664" offset="1118642">The employers on the other hand demanded that the hyphenates continue notwithstanding the strike in the picket lines to perform their duties other than as a writer under their personal service contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.371" offset="1181440">Some hyphenates crossed the picket lines to perform their normal supervisory and managerial functions as producers, directors, and story editors.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.073" offset="1224281">They perform no writing work which would otherwise had been performed the striking writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.760" offset="1255001">Many hyphenates did not go to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.273" offset="1273077">During and after the strike, the Guild filed internal charges against 31 of the hyphenates for crossing the picket line and 10 of them were subsequently convicted and were suspended or expelled from union membership and fines ranging from $500.00 to $50,000.00 were assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.751" offset="1370984">Later, the union membership voted to reduce the penalties of nine of the convicted hyphenates.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.649" offset="1406511">Upon charges filed by the employers, the board with member offending and dissenting concluded that the Guild had violated Section (8)(b)(1)(B) of the Act by disciplining and threatening the discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.170" offset="1468682">The hyphenates for crossing the picket line to perform their normal supervisory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.059" offset="1496163">Now Florida Power holds that a union's discipline of one of its members who was a supervisory employee can constitute a violation of Section (8)(b)(1)(B) only when that discipline may adversely affect the supervisor's conduct in performing the duties of and acting in his capacity as grievance adjuster or collective bargainer on behalf of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.169" offset="1612669">Now, the discipline in Florida Power was found not to have this effect because the supervisors were disciplined for crossing the picket line to engage in rank-and-file struck work which is neither collective bargaining or grievance adjustment nor any activities related thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.203" offset="1696784">We submit that a different conclusion is called for whereas here the supervisor crosses the picket line to perform his normal supervisory duties and they include as was true in this case grievance adjustment and collective bargaining functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.439" offset="1789675">Now, there are two bases on which we believe we can satisfy the Florida Power test.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.592" offset="1830322">The first refer to as a deprivation theory and the other is a carryover theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.053" offset="1868147">Turning to the deprivation theory first, we believe that the threats of discipline restrain the employers in their selection of a representative or grievance adjustment and collective bargaining no less than if the union had engaged in a direct strike to obtain the removal of a disfavored foreman with such authority would have done for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.081" offset="2000326">In so far as the threat kept hyphenates away from work and it appears that about a hundred of them did no go to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.718" offset="2042854">The employers were deprived of their services which included grievance adjustment and collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.348" offset="2073365">In so far as the hyphenates defied the union and went to work and about at least 31 then because there was a number of discipline, the employers will nonetheless have been coerced by the union strikes because the legality of a threat is not dependent upon its effectiveness and the strike rules here were in effect for at least a month before the strike started, before the employer was able to ascertain who would or would not come to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.523" offset="2210037">Now, in the first argument of this case, the union conceded that if it had threatened to discipline the hyphenates for crossing the picket lines to perform grievance adjustment or collective bargaining functions, it would have violated Section (8)(b)(1)(B) irrespective of whether the threat was effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.556" offset="2306168">It contends however that the board has not proved that the union's threat deprived the employers of their representatives for grievance adjustment or collective bargaining purposes because there is no finding, first that the hyphenates stayed away because of the threats rather than the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.142" offset="2412539">And two, there is no fining that the union intended to find the hyphenates for performing grievance adjustment and collective bargaining functions as distinguished from performing their other supervisory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.564" offset="2478263">Now, we submit that these contentions do not stand up for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.441" offset="2509714">In the first place, since the union threatened the hyphenates with discipline, if they went to work in any capacity, we submit that the burden is on them under familiar principles of law but this entangles the consequences for which they are chargeable from those in which they are immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.642" offset="2630504">You do not have just a picket line in a strike and supervisors electing not to honor that picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.026" offset="2684108">Secondly, as I pointed out, the union threatened the hyphenates with discipline if they went to work in any capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.167" offset="2724650">They knew that the employers had asked the hyphenates to perform their normal supervisory duties, these included grievance adjustment and collective bargaining and with the other employees remaining at work as they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.180" offset="2788702">It was likely that they would be called upon to engage in grievance adjustment and collective bargaining and the record shows that they in fact work.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.596" offset="2830393">In these circumstances, we submitted these --</text>

            <text syncTime="696.372" offset="2865397">Maybe I have a limited view of what the definition of collective bargaining but it seems to me that that has to do with negotiating the collective agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="705.241" offset="2900924">Well, the record shows that the producers when they were on location or frequently called upon to enter into on the spot agreements to cover people that had to be hired to perform services.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.989" offset="2999876">The producers are the only ones that on occasion were required to engage in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.449" offset="3025789">The others adjusted grievances and the record thus show that they did adjust grievances because they were shooting films.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.606" offset="3066436">There was no new writing going on but there were prepared scripts for the strike and they were being filmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.779" offset="3111053">They had actors at work.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.117" offset="3196421">Well, the statute does distinguish to, I think that you could make a good agreement, that the concept of collective bargaining as it is understood in labor management relations could in a broad sense include the day-to-day administration of the agreement and in so far as the adjustment of grievances under the contract is part of that day-to-day administration or the contract as part of the process of collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.685" offset="3838720">In the time allotted to me, I would like to primarily discuss what has come to be called in this case the deprivation theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.424" offset="3877695">It is basically a very straightforward and simple theory as it was described by the administrative law judge in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.690" offset="3906743">It does not require consideration such as whether something might have an effect in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.771" offset="3931089">But it deals with the present, the time of the strike and the basic question is, does the union's pressure from a supervisor not to work by coercion and restraint and threats and discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.801" offset="4003187">Foreseeably could it have the effect of preventing that person from working and thereby depriving the employer of the selected (8)(b)(1)(B) representative thereby coercing and restraining the employer in such selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.925" offset="4079673">The classical case on this subject was the Horner Case which is cited on our brief in which there was no contract and the union instructed the union members to withhold their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.246" offset="4128993">The superintendent on the job was a union member and he too was instructed not to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.224" offset="4152816">He disobeyed the union's order and was punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.569" offset="4166191">The National Labor Relations Board has no difficulty fining that the employee had been coerced and restrained in the selection of this supervisor of the 8(b)(1)(B) representative because the foreseeable effect to what the union did would have been that he would not have worked or alternatively if it did work and was punished, his services might not be available in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.644" offset="4258560">In that case, there was no refusal by any of the employees to work including the supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.017" offset="4284055">The effect was manifestly unsuccessful, I am stressing that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.376" offset="4301505">Post Florida Power, we have a very similar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.800" offset="4315193">In the case involving Skippy Enterprises now know us Wisconsin River Valley which was affirmed in the Seventh Circuit in the decision by Judge Becker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.528" offset="4350093">In that case, there was a very similar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.738" offset="4366916">There were two union elections, both lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.951" offset="4379768">After the election, the union said we will not permit any members to work on this job and they told the superintendent you cannot work or we will punish you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.892" offset="4415504">He did work and they punished him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.629" offset="4422504">And again the board heard it to be an 8(b)(1)(B) and the court affirmed on the theory that clearly here there was foreseeable that provision of the employer of his 8(b)(1)(B) designated representative and therefore for coercion and restraint in the selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.246" offset="4480914">Now the very important point of this to be made is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.198" offset="4492722">This issue was not really before the court in Florida Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.493" offset="4509962">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.745" offset="4514978">Because in Florida Power, first of all, at least in the Illinois Florida Power, the supervisors were told if you want to come to work, we would love to have you come.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.327" offset="4553221">If you do not want to come to work you do not have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.863" offset="4563461">They will not even designated as 8(b)(1)(B) representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.187" offset="4576731">They were given the option to designate themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.689" offset="4590733">In Florida Powers, the record is silent as to what these circumstances were because it is a stipulated record</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.493" offset="4613930">But in both cases, the union said if you come to work and perform your normal supervisory functions you can do that, we will not punish you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.713" offset="4654785">Thereby clearly not interfering, not coercing, not restraining the employee and selection if one accepts of you as a majority in Florida Power that struck work is not part of collective bargaining agreement adjusting and not emulated to it because the whole gamut of what a supervisor does could have been done without any interference on the part of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.135" offset="4744542">Now the touchstone of the Florida Power Case actual in the decision was the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.979" offset="4763873">What future effect may the conduct of the union have?</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.151" offset="4780591">That is not necessarily needed here even though it is present too because of the fact that there was an intended curtain effect during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.293" offset="4821133">Now, in this case, the employers ordered the union representatives to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.024" offset="4840046">They did not give them an option, only the supervisors, only the normal management functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.188" offset="4860735">And they were told, if you do not come to work we will discharge you and we will fine you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.798" offset="4891141">The union on the other hand said, you cannot work at all, no services in any capacity whatsoever including of course grievance adjusting and collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.130" offset="4932519">Now clearly, the union threats in the subsequent discipline had one purpose and one purpose only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.653" offset="4954566">One just has to look at what preceded the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.453" offset="4965747">Real activation of these their own members if you please who had no loyalty obligations to the union whatsoever who were paying no dues and had no union benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.480" offset="5001900">They were put back into the union by mandate in order to put them under the union's yoke and the neighbor's union to force them not to work and there by prevent the employer from selecting representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.767" offset="5047040">Now whether or not there was collective bargaining during the strike, I submit is not really relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.609" offset="5070446">Collective bargaining in the sense of negotiating a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.852" offset="5083402">The important thing is that these people who went to work were authorized to negotiate conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.849" offset="5111406">They were authorized and designated to settle grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.900" offset="5131572">Now the union was in no way here relying on any appeal to the loyalty of the supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.312" offset="5157172">Quite the contrary it was bringing them back, drafting them if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.948" offset="5175771">Many of them were associate members who did not have the right to vote on this strike rules and did not vote on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.031" offset="5196042">No one was allowed to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.482" offset="5201894">They were locked in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.788" offset="5207118">And in those circumstances they were told, if you come to work in any capacity we will do terrible things to you not only now but for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.814" offset="5239197">You will never be able to work again putting on maximum pressure on these people in order to force them not to work now and thereby coercing the employer for the present as well as for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.252" offset="5293009">Now the union argues here basically four points in defense of its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.660" offset="5322580">First of all, it says that there is no 8(b)(1)(B) because its efforts were unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.147" offset="5344522">A lot of people came to work, the ones they fined and punished and attempted to expel until the membership reversed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.708" offset="5370749">Secondly, that the motive of the union here was not established to be to prevent the performance of 8(b)(1)(B) work or indeed the manner of such performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.605" offset="5422367">And thirdly, the union argued in effect that 8(b)(1)(B) is designed to protect the supervisor rather than the employer but only in the performance of collective bargaining and grievance adjusting functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.234" offset="5468865">All premises, all of those four premises I would submit are totally wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.174" offset="5488614">Beginning with the first one, success is not required and we can cut through all the other possibilities and go straight to Florida Power because when this court said in Florida Power that a violation can be found only if it may adversely affect the conduct of the supervisor, very obviously the court did not say will affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.067" offset="5568235">It said may affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.203" offset="5576803">That does not have to be success within the terms of Florida Power itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.438" offset="5593731">And again in Florida Power this court said of its approval.Cases when 8(b)(1)(B) had been found when attempt was made to force an employer to accept only union members and supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.823" offset="5643259">So without going beyond the decision of this court in Florida Power it manifestly cleared that all that's involved in attempt, are not success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.549" offset="5678158">The number of cases in 8(b)(1)(B) involving all the attempts are legion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.507" offset="5701982">The union relies on 8(a)(3) case to the contrary, 8(a)(3) does not deal with coercion and restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.976" offset="5727895">It deals with discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.592" offset="5734374">Where motive is important and a lot of other things are important that are not important under coercion and restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.884" offset="5759451">As to the motive in this situation incidentally, the question here is clearly not why the union was doing it but what the effect of the employer is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.364" offset="5813368">That, the issue, is the employer being restrained and coerced?</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.338" offset="5829355">If he is, no one cares why the union did what it did, against turning to the Florida Power language, the question is what the effect is, not what the motivations were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.314" offset="5877211">8(b)(1)(B) comprises what the union suggests in its supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.714" offset="5890795">It is not intended to protect supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.174" offset="5900617">It is crystal clear under Section 2, 3, 11, and 14 of the Act that supervisors have no Section 7 guides to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.188" offset="5928725">The protection is afforded to the employer in its selection of supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.737" offset="5946906">And furthermore, that protection is accorded to the employer not in the performance of the function but in the selection of the persons who will perform the function that is the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.201" offset="6004793">Now let us do the performance of the function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.634" offset="6030498">On prior argument, there was a discussion and questions from the court to counsel for the union and it ultimately in effect counsels for the union conceded that if a supervisor came in with an affidavit I believe was the language stating, I will do only 8(b)(1)(B) work, I will only adjust grievances and bargains collectively, then indeed the union could not punish him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.831" offset="6119314">Well, Your Honors, looking at this realistically other than academically, what we have here is a concession that a man who maybe paid as much as $10,000.00 a week is a producer of a motion picture or even more can be brought in by an employer to sit there for a day, a week, a month, or maybe a year until a grievance arises which he has a right to adjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.476" offset="6213877">No one knows when grievances occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.785" offset="6223073">No one can predict and to say that employers can bring in supervisors for the sole purpose of doing 8(b)(1)(B) work is to say that it can be made economically impossible for them to make the selection and therefore they have to select someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.465" offset="6277825">And to me the situation is absolutely no way different from the situation in California Cottage Company 208 NLRB 994 at page 1004 affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 515 Section 1018 and in which this court denied cert, where a labor organization at Longshoremen Union of the Pacific Maritime Association entered into a contract in which they said if any containers have to be handled that have not been stuffed by Longshoremen, then we will impose a tax on those containers and it was a pretty stiff tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.342" offset="6417319">And the board held and the court affirmed that the imposition of that tax was exactly the same thing as saying we will not handle the containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.562" offset="6450233">And I submit in the same way in this case, one cannot say, that the 8(b)(1)(B) rights of the employers to select the representative are really protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.429" offset="6489626">If he has to pay the price of having someone sit all day waiting for a possible grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.534" offset="6518047">Now, the work involved here in the last argument by the union is of course that some of the work here involved collective bargaining type work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.158" offset="6556604">While the A through H function says we discussed on prior argument are very clearly managerial work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.536" offset="6578129">First of all the conflict says that they are not covered by the conflict but performed by excluded personnel and secondly, by there are very initial decisions involved are management decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.580" offset="6614282">In that respect, the work differs importantly from the Florida Power for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.458" offset="6641763">First of all, it clearly was not work that was struck work in the legal sense of the bargaining units work in the sense but more importantly it is managerial work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.196" offset="6680738">And this managerial work of any sort from which grievances flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.517" offset="6697979">If someone is performing management work, that is how grievances come about and if the person who is the manager performing these functions has grievance adjustment authority as all these people did then it necessarily follows that the performance of these management functions is "grievance related" as this court stated in Florida Power and its majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.534" offset="6790139">Now, basically 8(b)(1)(B) I would submit is a policy determination, unambiguously expressed by congress as Mr. Justice Stevens said in an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.601" offset="6826397">Namely, and I do not mean on this subject, but on a different statute equally, unambiguously expressed here that the intent is to protect the employer's right to select its management representatives free of coercion or restraint by the union, that is the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.542" offset="6894106">And I think the only way that court could fine in favor the right of Guild in this case would be to in effect tack to the statute of provision saying, this provision shall be inapplicable in case of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.671" offset="6942694">I would like to reserve my remaining time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.650" offset="6954606">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.550" offset="6994207">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.846" offset="7007373">I would like to make one observation concerning the deprivation theory before I talk about the adverse theory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.459" offset="7041750">The Guild contends that the board did not make findings that the threats were made to others than those who worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.431" offset="7069649">I would like to submit that that statement is erroneous in the board's decision in the petition at the appendix B3, the board goes on to say that it sustains the complaints alleged violation of Section 8(b)(1)(B) of the Act in toto and 13(d) of the second amended complaint alleges that commencing February through the promulgation of its strike rules and rule 30, its blacklist rule and by other actions if threatened numerous persons occupying the positions of the hyphenates that for all times in the future, no member or respondent would work with or perform services for them if they failed to honor or otherwise support the strike described in paragraph 10 above.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.218" offset="7272882">That I submit is a finding by the board that there were threats to hyphenates other than those who crossed the picket line that they would be threatened and blacklisted if they did cross the picket line and failed to honor the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.505" offset="7334008">Now, with respect to the second theory of the board which I would like to direct most of my time, the adverse carryover effect theory begins with this court's decision in Florida Power where it has been said the court stated that the union's discipline, one of its members who was a supervisory employee can constitute a violation at 8(b)(1)(B) only when that discipline may adversely affect the supervisor's conduct in performing the duties of an acting as the grievance adjuster or collective bargainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.673" offset="7462635">Now this conduct of the Guilds in this case which Judge Moore in his dissent in the Second Circuit characterized as the Guild's in terrorem conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.406" offset="7501610">Certainly would have an adverse carryover effect to supervisors in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.577" offset="7522299">Not only are the fines absolutely horrendous $50,000.00 even to somebody making $5,000.00 a week is a substantial sum of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.331" offset="7557303">The threats to expel from the union is certainly substantial but more importantly the blacklisting threats to creative people is absolutely an abhorrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.455" offset="7625744">The fact that after the strike started, the Guild rescinded rule 30 really does not absolve the guild or does the after effect reduction of the $50,000.00 fines take away the fact that the threats were made and they had an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.861" offset="7695438">The Guild or any other union could blacklist in the future if this court holds such kinds of unlawful and furthermore the role of dishonor was not rescinded at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.248" offset="7744966">There is evidence that it may well have continued in effect while the Guild argues with individual members acting along might have been able to refuse to work with as they call them scabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.988" offset="7787912">Certainly, they could not do it in concert and they could not do it if the Guild suggested it or condoned it and we submit that the evidence here is certainly very strong that that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.667" offset="7834619">Now the unions says, well, the employer could take care of the effects of this after the strike by requiring resignation and they could require the supervisors to resign after the strike and then in the future they would not have the power to submit that this is -- well, all that really could not happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.773" offset="7907030">In the first place, the blacklist and the throughout the blacklist is still there?</text>

            <text syncTime="1999.998" offset="8079961">However there is a difference that here the associate producer and the director's sold their value, their services as the ability to get outstanding creative people to work with them and that is not quite the same as a carpenter or someone working with the carpenter and so I think there may well be a difference in this industry because of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.031" offset="8196049">But nevertheless, the answer to the question about resignation after the strike is whether that then was the remedy for the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.319" offset="8253205">The blacklist would still be there and remember that the record is clear that the Guild have the right to prevent resignation for two years after the strike of any member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.583" offset="8306286">And of course, we submit that the self-help options really are not valid in this case because of the fact that a substantial percentage or the management people comes from the rank-and-file and will return to the position of writers as time passes and as a practical matter, resignation just is not going to get us the kind of producers that we need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.809" offset="8435226">Producers have to have the ability to work with the writers and therefore we feel that the self-help options are really not valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.832" offset="8495308">There is no question about what this conduct did in gender fear and the supervisor's members and gender fear and to those who adjusted writers grievances and gender fear and those who adjusted grievances of other employees because employees do not differentiate between the kind of union that makes the threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.032" offset="8580049">One union makes the threat and they feel that any union can also make a similar threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.093" offset="8616307">The record is to replete with evidence of the effect these threats upon individuals and I will not go on to that at this point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.261" offset="8656953">The carryover effect clearly restrains the selection of a supervisor as a statute sets forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.350" offset="8689345">If a union cannot by threats and by fines change the way a supervisor performs, it has an effect negated the employer's selection and has changed the supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.926" offset="8747651">In the legislative history, Mr. Senator Taft talks about Mr. 'x' and Mr. 'y'.Well suppose, that Mr. 'x' is a person who rigorously enforces the contract, keeps the union employees towing the mark and supervisor 'y' is very easy and very soft upon the employees and if that employer wants supervisor 'x', certainly if the union can then fine supervisor 'x' to such an extent but to turn him and the supervisor 'y', a supervisor that acts better towards the union members and softer towards them, he has in effect changed, the union has an effect changed the selection of that employer from 'x' to 'y.</text>

            <text syncTime="2890.235" offset="11640869">It is a difference while I would argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.874" offset="11655497">First of all, I would point out that Mr. Bakaly was incorrect when he said that the rule was that you could not resign for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.363" offset="11689456">In fact, not that it makes substantial amount of difference but the rule was that you could not resign for six months after negotiations and that was at page 579 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.933" offset="11743686">But the rule was that you could resign prior to entering in to negotiations and so that the employer have the option before the strike started, before the negotiation started.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.221" offset="11800842">But I acknowledge that this case is a little bit more difficult because of that but that does not make any difference to the board's theory because it has found a violation on the same theory in other cases, one which is presently before this court on the petition for certiorari, the Hammond Case, regardless to the fact that there was not that restraint of resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.733" offset="11918916">What it comes down to as both Mr. Bakaly and Mr. Keaton argued is that it is to onerous for us to require our supervisor members to withdraw from membership in the union and in fact the board found in this case that it was a substantial benefit to the employers to have their supervisors, members of the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.044" offset="12020166">But that is not the line that this court should draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.715" offset="12034795">That is the line that Congress drew and Congress said that the option is with the employers and if it is too onerous then the employers have to petition Congress or they have to give something up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.287" offset="12073143">They have to give something up in terms of negotiating something in the agreement or as they did in this case, what they did was to tell the supervisors that we will reimburse you for any fines that you are required to pay and we will provide a lawyer for your defense and that is what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.167" offset="12160601">Our view is that in Oakland Mailers the board found a violation by union discipline for the manner in which the supervisor had carried out his supervisory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.308" offset="12257149">In the present set of cases, the board says that it does not matter how the supervisor carries out his supervisory duties and it does not matter whether he in fact does any supervisory duties, in this case we have what we have describe in our supplemental brief as non-struck rank-and-file work, that is the A to H work, but that is not an issue so far as the board is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.997" offset="12359967">Any discipline for any reason, other than performing 50% rank-and-file struck work is in the board's view a violation and that it seems to us overlooks the second major point that this court stressed in Florida Power and namely that there is a distinct difference between (8)(b)(1)(B) functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.585" offset="12454322">The two things collective bargaining and grievance adjustment and those functions that are normal supervisory functions that are contained in Section 211 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.904" offset="12495595">Now, the board simply obliterates the distinction between them and does not even allude to that distinction in this court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.229" offset="12564872">In this case, a violation was found despite as I have said the fact that there was scant evidence of any (8)(b)(1)(B) functions by anybody and no evidence of any (8)(b)(1)(B) functions at least with respect to story editors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.848" offset="12659331">As an afterthought in the board's supplemental brief, they state that the employers were restrained in course in the interim between the time that the union announced its strike rules and the time that the supervisors came to work, the employers did not know whether they would have those supervisors at work and therefore their production expectations were up in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.613" offset="12782420">Well, I think it is sufficient to point out that the board's argument to that effect was not supported by a citation to the record or by a citation to a board findings, I guess there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.460" offset="12841770">With respect to the threats, the board based its findings of a violation on the conclusion that since the discipline is a violation, the threat is a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.535" offset="12878132">And if that is the board's theory, then the same arguments that are made with respect to the discipline are also applicable to the threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.170" offset="12908643">The board's brief goes on to state the deprivation theory and in our view, the deprivation theory requires at a minimum that at least under Oakland Mailers that a person was restrained in course; the person was disciplined for the manner in which he performed his supervisory functions, a finding which was not made and which was deemed not relevant to the board's theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.749" offset="13242906">For the first 20 years after this provision which had received the support of both of the majority and the minority in the Senate and one of the very few provisions in Taft-Hartley to do so was enacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.943" offset="13411762">As the court described the change in the board's thinking in the Oakland Mailers Case, the board moved on to the proposition that disciplinary action against an individual, a supervisor member for the way he performs his grievance handling or collective --</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.890" offset="13571526">What I meant to say was that Oakland Mailers, the board said that discipline of supervisor members for the way they perform grievance handling or collective bargaining functions violates the Act as well as economic pressure directly on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.176" offset="13644669">And while I return to that holding, I think it suffices to say here that at least the board's approach to that point had the virtue of confining itself to the subjects that Congress had indicated it wished regulated namely the selection of grievance handling and collective bargaining representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.238" offset="13736934">A representative for the purpose of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances may or may not be a supervisor in fact.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="3426.726" offset="13786880">That is right and in the normal collective bargaining situation one that Congress was most particularly concerned about, the employer said he will not be a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.865" offset="13843409">Then the board took what we regard as the quantum step in this progression and stated the rule that Section (8)(b)(1)(B) is a general prohibition of union discipline of supervisor members for the conduct in the course of representing the interest of the employer that is the board's language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.620" offset="13946436">And that theory came to this court in the Florida Power and Light Case because the board said that doing rank-and-file struck work turn strike was conduct in the course of representing the interest of the employer and that discipline of that type by the union was therefore a violation of Section (8)(b)(1)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.385" offset="14045492">This court rejected both the theory as applied in that case and we most strenuously argue rejected the reasoning as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.210" offset="14092826">Since Florida Power and Light, the sum total of the board's recognition of this court's decision and its reasoning in Florida Power and Light, is to say that (8)(b)(1)(B) is a general prohibition of union discipline of supervisor-members except for members who spend a minimal amount of time performing supervisory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.643" offset="14210482">For everybody else, even if the individual performs struck work, the pre-Florida Power and Light rule continues to represent the board's thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.257" offset="14265025">So not only has the board ignored the reasoning of this court's opinion in that case but we would submit it to even narrowed the holding because there can be instances in which a union disciplines a member for performing struck work and in which the board will say that the discipline is unlawful namely a situation in which he also performed more than a minimal amount of supervisory activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.157" offset="14380591">So even in that situation we say the board has given very little credence to this court's approach to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.933" offset="14419670">We think the defects in the board's thinking since Oakland Mailers can be summed up as follows: First and most importantly, the board destroys another interest recognized by Congress in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.603" offset="14510367">The interest that it destroys is the union's right to discipline members which by and large was left untouched by Congress in 1947 and as a historic fact in this court has noted this fact Congress very well understood in 1947 that union's disciplined their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.044" offset="14596153">There is nothing left of that right under the board's theory as regards the supervisory members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.830" offset="14631262">We do not think that the board has the authority to view the statute as a one value statute and to say that the interest protected in Section (8)(b)(1)(B) that of selecting a representative to engage in grievance handling or collective bargaining is so important that all other interest must be denied and that there must be a broad prophylactic rule which prohibits discipline no matter what its purpose and no matter or whether or not it is intended to affect the protected interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3998.348" offset="16073326">But at any rate, our view is that the board has to find that individual who was disciplined actually performed grievance handling or collective bargaining work and that the union fined him or otherwise disciplined him for doing so and that means in a situation in which somebody crosses a picket line and performs only grievance handling or collective bargaining work and the union fined him the board's general counsel have a relatively easy case to prove where somebody crosses a picket line and performs some grievance handling work and some other work then you would have the classic case that you always have under Section 8(a)(3) of the Act which prohibits employer discipline of employees for engaging any union activity that normally arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.172" offset="16356597">And as I was about to say when Mr. Justice White asked me the question that began this discussion in the union's supplemental brief, they refer to the American Ship Case and it does seem to us that that is helpful in putting this section in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.837" offset="16427337">In 1935, Congress said to employees, who cannot discipline employees for engaging in protected activity but did not prohibit employers from disciplining people for breaking sharp rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.562" offset="16486165">The board has never and we believe that it is plain they could not say that because employees will suspect that when a union activist is disciplined for breaking a sharp rule, everybody in the plant will fear discipline that the employers have lost their right to discipline people for breaking sharp rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.300" offset="16601208">And because employees both engaged in union activity and to earn a living continue to work to the employer and subject to his rules, the board in an (8)(a)(3) Case must show not that the person who is fired or otherwise disciplined was engaged in protected activity but also that the employer's purpose was to punish him for doing so.</text>

            <text syncTime="4400.949" offset="17683722">So, the board does not care at all whether or not the individuals performed Section (8)(b)(1)(B) functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.690" offset="17714756">It finds a violation on a general theory that if no matter what the union fines people for what its interest is, what its motive is and what they have done during the strike, it is illegal because it may have some effect on the way that they will carry out their collective bargaining or grievance handling functions in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.342" offset="17825306">And what we say is that is just like saying that whenever an employer disciplines somebody for breaking a sharp rule that is a violation of section (8)(a)(3) on the ground that employees may in the future fear to engage in protected activity and whether or not that individual actually broke the sharp rule and the employer was motivated by the breach of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.007" offset="17931990">There are many ways and the board has 40 odd years of experience improving what motive is in these situations where people are sometimes engaged in protective activity and sometimes engaged in a un-protective activity and you do not solve the problem by taking away under one instance the employer's right to discipline which he had prior to 1935 or to take away from the union completely its right to discipline the supervisory members which unions had prior to 1947 and which there is no indication that Congress intended to take away.</text>

            <text syncTime="4826.390" offset="19385548">Now it is argued on the employer side that they do not very much like what Congress gave them because what they would really benefit them would be the right to have individuals handled both grievances and collective bargaining and perform other supervisory functions and have those individuals immune from discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.400" offset="19501531">Because it is inconvenient or expensive to them to have somebody only just grievances or only engage in collective bargaining they would like to combine these various functions in one person and assure that that individual cannot be disciplined for anything he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.372" offset="19577495">And our view on that is that there are many things we would like as well that the statute does not provide us and that there is no way that we concede in reading the statute which would give the employers what they want without destroying entirely the other interest which Congress recognized in 1947.</text>

            <text syncTime="4954.195" offset="19896712">Our view is that what Congress said was that if you credit Oakland Mailers is that we cannot go after them for performing (8)(b)(1)(B) functions or the way they performed (8)(b)(1)(B) functions and what the board is saying is that we cannot do anything to them ever because of the supposed carryover or deprivation effects and that is the difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="4995.503" offset="20062015">That is right and it is one thing to say that the employers coerce the way you deprive him of somebody who is loyal in carrying out the grievance handling function which is the Oakland Mailers step and is at least a step from the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.311" offset="20145189">But it is quite another thing to say that if your ostensible purpose is far removed, you also commit a violation just in the minute I have, I would say that the board's theory in this regard that no matter what your reason for disciplining the supervisor member is you commit an (8)(b)(1)(B) violation is the same type of theory presented to this court in Teamster's Union v. Labor Board and Labor Board v. News Syndicate, the hiring court cases where they said that any union involvement in the hiring process through its own representatives was per se a violation because the people subjected to that system would fear that the union would act improperly and this court in those cases said no it is like (8)(a)(3) and the board must prove its case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="5092.841" offset="20451344">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5094.932" offset="20459703">I would just like to -- well on one point, as it was pointed out earlier, we are not dealing here with Section (8)(a)(3) which describes discrimination, encourage or discourage union membership or it is well settled that ordinarily motive is a crucial ingredient.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.690" offset="20594704">We are dealing here with (8)(b)(1)(B) which prescribes restraint and coercion of the employer and it is equally well settled that there the test is normally the reasonable tendency of the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.760" offset="20663040">Now, the union here as I understand its position concedes that if the union threatened a supervisor for going to work to perform grievance adjustment and collective bargaining functions, that would be a violation of (8)(b)(1)(B) even if the threat were not effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.197" offset="20796787">The employer would be restrained and coerced by such a threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.103" offset="20832418">They say however, that there was no finding here that the union intended to discipline them for performing grievance adjustment and collective bargaining purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.351" offset="20905352">There are two answers to that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.539" offset="20914129">In the first place, on this record, they cannot be heard to make such an argument because in view of the file examiners findings that Mr. Justice White alluded to, the union made it quite clear that they were indifferent to whatever work it was that the hyphenates performed, they were going to be disciplined for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.585" offset="21046309">And where a union couches its threat that broadly in a circumstance where the individuals involved are cloaked with collective bargaining and grievance adjustment functions, it must be deemed to have intended to effect their collective bargaining and grievance adjustment functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.727" offset="21150903">But beyond that we submit that it is irrelevant whether the union intended to discipline the hyphenates from performing over on the grievance adjustment or collective bargaining functions because in the real world, an employer does not select a representative just for grievance adjustment or collective bargaining functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.269" offset="21269081">These are only part of the representatives total functions and a union assurance that a representative can go in to perform collective bargaining assuming that you have a representative as you had here who was armed with those functions as well as others that he can only go in to perform those but if he performs any of his other functions, he is going to be fined, he is going to restrain the employer no less than if they merely said you cannot go in there and perform collective bargaining and grievance adjustment functions because no employer is likely to hire only a half management representative and therefore we submit that you have to look at the reasonable tendency of the union's conduct and on the facts here, the board properly concluded that the reasonable tendency of it was to restrain the employer in the selection of his representative for (8)(b)(1)(B) functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.467" offset="21545874">Thank you.</text>
