            <text syncTime="73.156" offset="372557">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.890" offset="387499">The question before you is whether Washington’s non-discriminatory exercise of its police power to protect a unique environment is preempted by the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 or some other federal doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.468" offset="457821">In 1972, the Congress passed the PWSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.789" offset="479137">The object of that Act is the safety of vessels and the protection of our environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.096" offset="504319">Title I addresses operational safety in ports, waterways, and other congested waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.645" offset="530546">It authorizes, but it does not require the coastguard to establish vessel traffic systems and to mandate safety devices and standards for use in connection with those systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.210" offset="580806">As the Solicitor General says, it is like providing for safer highways and for traffic controls for automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.095" offset="612362">Title II directs the coastguard, and in this case it directs it, to set minimum design and construction standards for tankers and it thus, it is thus in the Solicitor General’s words “like providing for safer automobiles.”</text>
            <text syncTime="148.232" offset="672861">In the five years since 1972, the coastguard has setup, pursuant to Title I, a skeletal vessel traffic system on Puget Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.044" offset="716120">In the coastguard’s own words, its major components are “a traffic separation scheme and a vessel moving reporting system,” which of course, supplies only to larger vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.147" offset="772544">When vessels get here, they have this system in the direction of Seattle and Tacoma off of the chart below.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.685" offset="806713">If they are going to Arco’s Cherry Point Refinery, they pass through all of these islands on this system and here to that Cherry Point Refinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.733" offset="862824">The system also includes a limited radar which does not cover Rosario Strait through the islands.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="206.259" offset="904933">The radar which is, you are not talking about radar on the vessel?</text>

            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="210.577" offset="922278">I am talking about the coastguard’s radar to see where the vessels all are.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.091" offset="940250">That is about all.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.964" offset="947774">It is a wild exaggeration to call this a comprehensive and all encompassing pattern of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.186" offset="976717">Because of the urgent need for more stringent local controls caused by the unique nature of Puget Sound, the 1975 Washington State legislature adapted this Chapter 125, the law here under challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.788" offset="1043068">That statute, based on a well-founded fear of a disaster comparable to that of the Torrey Canyon, limited the maximum risk from the most disastrous possible oil spill by prohibiting tankers of more than 125,000 tons from Puget Sound entirely, the line drawn by the legislature being roughly like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.079" offset="1148290">The legislature sought to minimize the risks of any oil spill in Puget Sound by requiring a tug escort for tankers between 40 and 125,000 tons unless they are designed in such a manner as to render a tug escort unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.669" offset="1214641">These requirements are based on the confined nature of Puget Sound, the lack of maneuverability of large tankers and the near impossibility of the cleanup of a major oil spill in an area, including 196 islands in San Juan County alone.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="303.968" offset="1295829">Mr. Attorney General, how did they happen to land on that 125,000 deadweight ton figure?</text>
            <text syncTime="312.573" offset="1330206">Did they pick it out of the air or was there some reason for it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="314.820" stopTime="364.152">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="314.820" offset="1339193">There was considerable discussion in the legislative debate over the appropriate largest tanker which should be permitted to go through the Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.622" offset="1390393">A 225,000-ton tanker, for example, probably could not get through Rosario Straits at all loaded because it would draw too much water.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.946" offset="1431770">But I believe that they simple debated over the proposition that at a given size, a major spill, a spill which lost all of the oil on board would totally ruin the entire area.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.374" offset="1477433">The state would lack any reasonable cleanup facilities to take care of such a spill.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.316" offset="1501152">They hope that between 40 and 125,000 tons, even with a major one, the disaster would not be an irretrievable one.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="364.152" stopTime="373.458">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="364.152" offset="1536574">You are not arguing then that the state might be able to exclude, say, tankers of 50,000, if it landed on that theory?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="373.458" stopTime="411.346">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="373.458" offset="1573772">The question before you would be much different and much more difficult for me under those circumstances, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.712" offset="1598745">Very few 125,000-ton tankers ever entered Puget Sound before this.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.530" offset="1622046">We are concerned with the fact that there are six refineries on Puget Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.877" offset="1643467">They must be supplied more by tanker now because of the fact that the Canadians have cut off the pipeline to Cherry Point.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.844" offset="1675336">The two years that we have enforced this law, all of those refineries on Puget Sound have, in fact, been supplied by tankers of less than 125,000 tons to the full extent of their needs.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="411.346" stopTime="417.745">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="411.346" offset="1725282">Are all the refineries up there in the Cherry Point area?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="417.745" stopTime="426.187">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="417.745" offset="1750882">Two refineries are here, two refineries are here, and two refineries are in Tacoma which is awfully sharp to the south.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="426.187" offset="1784633">How many of those refineries can handle 125,000-ton ships?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="429.809" stopTime="483.137">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="429.809" offset="1799157">One, Arco’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.318" offset="1825175">Now, there is another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.483" offset="1833847">Even the Solicitor General fails clearly in his brief to distinguish between Puget Sound and all of the other waters and coastlines of the State of Washington to which this law does not apply because the legislature was making a careful value judgment, leaving open to the larger tankers, should there be a major tanker port in the future, the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Pacific Ocean Coastline of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.794" offset="1959130">In the more than two years, since the passage of 125, as I said, those six refineries have gotten all the petroleum products they needed, operating totally consistently with the state law which has been enforced all that time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="483.137" stopTime="489.834">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="483.137" offset="2012525">Is there a legislative definition or an accepted definition of the line between the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="489.834" stopTime="764.817">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="489.834" offset="2039274">The legislature defined the language I have drawn here from a particular like to another particular like.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.996" offset="2067904">In 1972, right after the PWSA, the Congress also passed the Coastal Zone Management Act which authorizes coastal states to define and I am quoting from that Act, “permissible land and water uses within the coastal zone.”</text>
            <text syncTime="514.424" offset="2137599">Transportation and navigation are among the uses expressly recognized by the CCMA as proper subjects of the State Management Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.605" offset="2178350">Upon approval by the Secretary of Commerce, the State Plan becomes National Policy and other federal agencies are required to conduct their activities in a manner consistent with the State Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.306" offset="2229132">The Washington State Plan explicitly includes Chapter 125 as a “means by which the state proposes to exert control” over oil transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.364" offset="2277406">In June of last year, the Plan was expressly approved by the Secretary of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.354" offset="2301335">Finally, earlier this month, since all briefs except our reply brief was filed, the Congress approved S1522 which bars any increase in crude oil handling capacity at any facility in the state east of Port Angeles, right here, except for local consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.255" offset="2408959">Arco’s proposal to utilize a pipeline to the Midwest for Alaskan oil has thus been effectively prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.483" offset="2453890">S1522, like Chapter 125, treats Puget Sound as unique and recognizes the threat of pollution posed by tanker traffic in the Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.036" offset="2500074">Now, the state’s law will be avoided of course, if Congress has expressly preempted it or if it conflicts with some federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.070" offset="2544169">The beginning point of your inquiry into that question is explained in Jones v. Rath Packing in the following words.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.344" offset="2573322">“We start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress, but when Congress has unmistakably ordained that its enactments alone are to regulate a part of commerce, state laws regulating that aspect of commerce must fall.”</text>
            <text syncTime="646.319" offset="2665168">We start with the obvious proposition that the Congress did not expressly preempt all forms of state control over tanker operations by the passage of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.166" offset="2716577">The only reference in the PWSA, arguably indicating an intention by the Congress to preempt state authority is found in Section 102 (b) which contains no express preemption at all, but only a negative inference and I quote that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.139" offset="2792541">“Nothing contained in Title I prevents a state from prescribing, for structures only, higher safety equipment requirements or safety standards, then those which may be prescribed pursuant to this Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="694.983" offset="2859833">Arco claims that the plain meaning of that language preempts any state rule affecting tanker operations ipso facto, not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.427" offset="2901628">Let us examine the inevitable results of Arco’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.839" offset="2923258">First, it would destroy a state-managed vessel traffic system even though the coastguard never setup its own system in replacement, but Section 102 (e) of the Act requires the coastguard to consider existing systems in determining the need for or the substance of the coastguard’s own regulation from which it is obvious that local systems are valid at least until the coastguard supersedes them.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.436" offset="3041645">Next, Arco’s assertion flies in the face of the plain language of Section 102 (b) itself which limits the state only to the extent that standards or equipment have been prescribed, in the words of Section 102 (b) by the coastguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.538" offset="3114056">The coastguard has not adapted general access limitations or tug escort provisions on Puget Sound.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="764.817" stopTime="769.144">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="764.817" offset="3139238">Then why did Congress say “structures only” in that language?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="769.144" stopTime="798.203">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="769.144" offset="3156479">Why did they say “Structures only?” From the legislative history of that Act, it was speaking of equipment and standards which go on the vessels; their radar systems, their crew manning requirements, vessel equipment, and safety standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.379" offset="3233488">These are what go on the vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.045" offset="3240071">The paragraphs in the Congressional Report on it indicate that kind of limitation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="798.203" stopTime="803.115">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="798.203" offset="3272776">So it meant that the states could not act in that area?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="slade_gorton" startTime="803.115" stopTime="1006.862">
            <label>Mr. Slade Gorton</label>
            <text syncTime="803.115" offset="3292420">In that area, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.017" offset="3295973">We cannot say what brand or radar or radio that the vessels are carrying.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.421" offset="3341635">Moreover, as the Solicitor General says, the legislative history of Section 102 (b) shows that it deals only with these safety equipment standards and not with externals such as tug escorts or access limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.854" offset="3399313">Finally, Arco’s position, if we look at that Section very carefully, would not allow the state even to enforce its shoreline zoning requirements as to loading docks, for example, on strictly environmental grounds because such regulations would not be the safety requirements to which Arco believes the savings clause in Section 102 (b) is very strictly limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.542" offset="3510073">The true meaning of Section 102 (b) is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.656" offset="3522507">When the coastguard establishes a vessel traffic system on a waterway, a state may not establish a conflicting system or require the use of different radio frequencies, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.359" offset="3561377">When the coastguard prescribes a given type of radar, the state may not prescribe a different type.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.375" offset="3585410">Thus, we, on this subject, are in accord with both the District Court and the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.603" offset="3610383">The PWSA does not expressly preempt Chapter 125, but in your preemption analysis in Jones v. Rath Packing, you go into a further test and I will quote that.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.667" offset="3658553">“Our task is to determine whether under the circumstances of this particular case, the state’s law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.977" offset="3711842">This inquiry requires us to consider the relationship between state and federal laws as they are interpreted and applied not merely as they are written.”</text>
            <text syncTime="918.696" offset="3754683">The purposes of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, as they are stated in Section 101, are safety and the prevention of environmental harm resulting from vessel damage or destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.375" offset="3805465">The purposes of the state act are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.452" offset="3817690">Not only does it frustrate the purposes of Congress, it facilitates and enhances them.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.526" offset="3842037">The means which the state act uses to achieve those purposes are also consistent with the PWSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.740" offset="3870876">There is no conflict or friction between the coastguard vessel traffic system as it operates in practice on Puget Sound and the state requirements as they are actually carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.999" offset="3919882">For more than two years those systems have worked in total harmony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1081.635" offset="4406490">We are only claiming even here that the incomplete and fragmentary coastguard rules and traffic system on Puget Sound has not yet superseded our state rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.520" offset="4454033">Arco goes on, of course, to argue preemption beyond Section 102 on a more general and less precise grounds, the need for uniformed national standards, the nature of the subject matter, the dominance of the federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.306" offset="4513175">In this field, Arco elevates its preemption argument to the constitution independently of the PWSA, claiming that the field of Chapter 125 is one which the state constitutionally cannot regulate even if Congress has not occupied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.970" offset="4579839">Note well how broad and expensive this claim is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.199" offset="4596766">If it is accepted, the states could not protect its environment as Washington has even if Congress had not acted at all or perhaps even if Congress had expressly attempted to delegate that authority to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.563" offset="4650161">The very Pilotage Laws of 1789 which were approved in Cooley v. Board of Wardens would be unconstitutional under that argument as they dealt with vessel operations exactly as our tug escort requirements do which Arco claim requires uniform national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.017" offset="4736051">In this argument, Arco equates the design and construction of oil tankers with their movement in local waters, but whatever one may say about design and construction, local movement is inherently and inevitably a local concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.553" offset="4802193">For almost two centuries, this Court has allowed the enforcement of local regulations on matters of local concern as long as they do not positively conflict with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.748" offset="4846915">As Gilmore and Black have put it, the states have enacted “massive legislation dealing with shipping matters.” Such legislation which has been approved by this Court includes quarantine regulations, docking, local speed controls, vessel inspection, and conservation legislation designed to protect the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.766" offset="4935000">Title I of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act itself recognizes the existence and validity of such legislation and is careful to speak of possible preemption only on the basis of the actual effect of coastguard regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.473" offset="4993828">Finally, the Coastal Zone Management Act invites state plans which deal with navigation matters and allows the Secretary of Transportation to transmute them into federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.444" offset="5041684">No resort to a demand for so-called uniformity standing in the air can withstand that this specific congressional recognition of local concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.569" offset="5082226">The test of preemption, as it applies to regulation such as Washington’s, is not a vague appeal to the need for national uniformity, but actual conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.514" offset="5126007">To the extent that this case is governed by the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, this entire controversy revolves around Title I of that Act and not Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.563" offset="5170206">It is in treating the access limitation as a design control that both Arco and the Solicitor General err.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.393" offset="5201553">Conceptually, design precedes even construction in the life of a tanker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.267" offset="5224959">Washington State does not require any design features.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.530" offset="5246066">Were the coastguard to establish an access limitation based on size in Puget Sound, like or conflicting with our own, for safety or environmental reasons, it would act under Title I of the PWSA, not the design standards of Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.767" offset="5310954">This misconception together with one other leads the Solicitor General to view the state’s access limitation less favorably than he does the tug escort requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.290" offset="5353064">That second misconception is that the proposition that large tankers cause a greater risk of oil spills than smaller ones is unreasonable, thus, causing our access limitation to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.869" offset="5403428">Now, the parties stipulated, this case was tried on a stipulation, to the existence of expert support for the proposition that large tankers were less safe, disputed though it may be and its reasonableness was never an issue between the parties, but as I have already said that there is emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.032" offset="5480019">The legislature had an additional rationale which is not even subject to dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.264" offset="5501021">Supertankers clearly cause a risk of greater spills and the state wishes to place a reasonable ceiling on the most serious oil spill disaster to which Puget Sound may be subjected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.916" offset="5547624">That is a rationale concern and justifies the state’s regulation unless and until it conflicts with another established or authorized by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.511" offset="5594017">Your line of cases to which Mr. Justice Blackmun adverted in his question on the enrollment and registrations statutes, clearly permit an even-handed state regulation for environmental purposes way back to the cases first coming after Gibbons v. Ogden, Manchester v. Massachusetts is one of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.740" offset="5690879">Interestingly enough, your most recent case in the field of preemption deals with exactly that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.189" offset="5720659">Mr. Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, wrote in Douglas v. Seacoast Products less than six months ago, “States may impose even upon federal licensees, reasonable non-discriminatory conservation and environmental protection measures, otherwise, within their police power.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.462" offset="5801743">That is all we have done in the State of Washington and we should not be only tolerated in that attempt to protect our environment, we should be encouraged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.425" offset="6305593">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.543" offset="6362122">In Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers against Paul, Mr. Justice Brennan stated for the Court that the maturity of avocados seems to be inherently unlikely candidate for exclusive federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.915" offset="6431607">By contrast, we would submit that the subject matter in this case, regulation of the construction, design, and navigation of seagoing tankers, the lifeline of this country’s energy-fueled economy, bringing oil as they do from abroad and now from Alaska is an obvious candidate for exclusive regulation by the federal government and one which, under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 as well as other legislation has been preempted to the exclusion of state regulation such as the Washington Tanker Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.859" offset="6599418">In striking the delicate balance between energy needs and environmental protection, a balance which involved the foreign relations of the United States, 50% of our oil comes from abroad, 95% of tankers are of foreign registry, a balance also which involves the competing interests of the coastal and the inland states, only the federal government has the sensitivity and the tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.559" offset="6718118">If Mr. Gorton is right and the Tanker Law is just a simple exercise of the police power, and I would note in that connection the view in Southern Pacific and Arizona that one cannot always hide behind the convenient apologetics of the police power, then other states can adapt different size limits, different design requirements, different tug boat penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.368" offset="6837446">Alaska has already done so encouraging large tankers, mandating different design characteristics, and 15 states' amicus curiae are waiting eagerly in the wings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.525" offset="6902020">In this context, I turn to the specific features of the Washington Tanker Law, each of which is preempted by federal law and by coastguard action pursuant to federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.647" offset="6954474">First, the size limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.023" offset="6972028">We believe that it is clear from the Ports and Waterways Safety Act that a size limit is bad both as a traffic regulation under Title I of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act and as a design requirement under Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.738" offset="7050918">1013 of Title I gives the coastguard the power to set size and speed limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.882" offset="7083415">In the Senate Report, leading up to the Act, at pages 32 and 33, there is a specific statement rejecting the idea of general-size limitation on tankers and a statement of preference for specificity for flexible regulation by the coastguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.705" offset="7174739">The coastguard has established a vessel traffic system for Puget Sound and despite Mr. Gorton’s view, I would suggest that pages 141 through 198 of the Appendix which spell out that vessel traffic system indicate its comprehensiveness, including specific reporting requirements in Rosario Strait.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.611" offset="7586428">I suspect it would be tougher, but the local traffic plan contemplates also that there would be limits on the size of vessels going in both directions in Rosario Strait and the coastguard retains both the power to ban vessels from Puget Sound or from any other waterway of the United States when there is a determination that such a ban is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.439" offset="7709726">So in our view the size limit is precluded both by Title I, giving the coastguard to set size limits, and by Title II, giving the coastguard the power to set design requirements because the coastguard in mandating design requirements has not drawn any limit on the size of a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.371" offset="7793423">The Maritime Administration, in administering the Subsidy Program, has not drawn any size limitation on the size of vessels which will be functioning in the commerce of the United States and there has been no effort to restrict either the building of vessels in US shipyards or the building of vessels in other countries in terms of their ability to come into the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.353" offset="12725341">Our view also would be that the coastguard can preempt under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act only if the Ports and Waterways Safety Act itself is regarded as preemptive, that is it is very difficult as a logical proposition to understand how if the statute does not do any preempting, it can be read as giving an abstract power of preemption and at the same time of course, the coastguard has done in what we would submit as the only logical way, the non-imposition of size limits except selectively, the non-imposition of design requirements as contemplated by Washington, with the imposition of plenty of other design requirements and the development of tug escort systems in areas where things appropriate and under specific circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.080" offset="12924290">I would also note that there is of course a commerce issue which is an equally significant one because under Kelly, there is no reason to think that this is on seaworthiness in the commonly accepted sense and that there is a burden under such cases as Southern Pacific and Arizona, Beard, and May Pier that there is an impact on foreign policy because you have, as set forth at considerable length in our brief, the problem of negotiating with other countries about what the size limits are going to be, what the design requirements are going to be.</text>
