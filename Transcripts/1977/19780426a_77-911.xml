            <text syncTime="53.689" offset="294717">You have the honor of arguing what we hope is the last case to be argued in the Courts this year.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl L. Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="62.518" offset="330034">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.851" offset="343304">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.510" offset="357933">The heart of this case is that the Freedom of Information Act was never intended to be a new and superior set of discovery rules to supersede and override the balance struck within existing discovery rules and to provide a vehicle for enjoining trials and hearing are pending for litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.404" offset="441525">The Fifth Circuit itself from whence this case comes has emphasized this principle with respect to criminal litigation in a case called United States v. Murdock which is cited in the Robbins case itself in footnote 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.003" offset="511951">The Court notes that when it was previously faced, earlier last year with a FOIA demand in a criminal context, it held and I quote, ?We find that FOIA was not intended as a device to delay ongoing litigation or to enlarge the scope of discovery beyond that already provided by the federal rules of criminal procedure.?</text>
            <text syncTime="135.756" offset="622919">The Fifth Circuit has attempted to distinguish Murdock on the ground that the special dangers inherent in upsetting the discovery balance in a criminal prosecution are so compelling that Congress could not have possibly intended such a result, but in the case at Bar by contrast, enlarging the scope of discovery in labor proceedings will have a salutary effect upon the board?s procedures.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="163.868" offset="735454">Mr. Taylor, I spent three years in the executive branch and resolutely adhere to juxtaposition that you are taking now and I thought was right then in doing it, I have a good deal of difficulty after the 1974 amendments where it seems to me that Congress just plowed ahead and said that that is what they meant?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl L. Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="185.056" offset="820196">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the statute speaks of enforcement proceedings without distinguishing between particular types of enforcement proceedings and I suggest to the Court that what applies to an enforcement proceeding applies to all equally and I think the legislative history bears me out on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.720" offset="890831">If we go back to the 1966 bill, the original act and look at the legislative history of what was intended initially by Wxemption 7 and then trace it through the 1974 amendment --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="214.859" stopTime="224.371">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="214.859" offset="939419">You compared the House history of the bill of the 66 Act with the senate history?</text>
            <text syncTime="221.205" offset="964810">It looks like you are talking about two entirely different bills?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_l_taylor" startTime="224.371" stopTime="344.557">
            <label>Mr. Carl L. Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="224.371" offset="977453">The bill of course, came up in the senate first and what is key in the senate as far as we are concerned is the participation of Senator Humphrey who specifically protested during the debates in the senate that the Act might be used to obtain statements of witnesses prior to hearing in Labor Board proceedings is specifically addressed to Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.515" offset="1077972">He expressed the fear and a quote ?that witnesses would be loathe to give statements if they knew that their statements were going to be made known to the parties before the hearing.?</text>
            <text syncTime="259.709" offset="1118723">In response to that, Senator Long proposed the language which became Exemption 7 which he said would meet that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.587" offset="1154250">Now, in the House, the relevant consideration is the focus on the concept of no earlier or greater access.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.272" offset="1193015">That is essentially what Senator Long was trying to get to with the language he proposed and the House Report does pick that up which is what I am getting to.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.310" offset="1225198">The concept is solid in the 66 Act, that Congress did not intend to provide discovery through the FOIA by providing for earlier or greater access to materials in an ongoing enforcement proceeding than one could obtain by discovery with respect to whatever set of discovery rules apply to that enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.762" offset="1314955">In sum, I suggest as the Fifth Circuit held in Hardeman Garment decided last year, ?The legislative history of the original version of the Exemption 7 clearly indicates that Congress intended to include investigatory files of the NLRB within the exemption.?</text>
            <text syncTime="328.611" offset="1394367">The question before us I submit is whether the 1974 amendments to Exemption 7 were intended to repudiate the concept of noninterference with discovery in general or with the protection of board witness statements in particular.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="344.557" offset="1458210">Certainly, there is nothing in the Act either in 66 or 74 which suggests the Labor Board is different from OSHA or different from the FTC or different from any other agency, is there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_l_taylor" startTime="356.312" stopTime="413.833">
            <label>Mr. Carl L. Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="356.312" offset="1505231">There is nothing to distinguish between various types of enforcement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.295" offset="1521113">That is exactly right and to that extent, we suggest that the there cannot be a difference between criminal enforcement proceedings and any other type of enforcement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.860" offset="1563327">The Act speaks of enforcement proceedings generically and that it makes no sense for the Fifth Circuit to say we cannot believe that Congress would have intended to interfere with discovery rules and criminal proceedings, but we believe it when it comes to Labor Board proceedings which are also enforcement proceedings, especially in light of Senator Humphrey?s particular concern, particularly focused concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.394" offset="1661548">I am not suggesting that he was singling out the Labor Board for special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.791" offset="1679102">What I think the legislative history shows is that he was particularly concerned about the Board, and therefore, interested in getting the Act worded so that it would protect against discovery in all enforcement proceedings and that is indeed what happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.448" offset="1781711">Does that support the notion, there is a general prohibition against discovery?</text>

            <text syncTime="428.649" offset="1794563">Mr. Justice Stevens, if I am right that the concept of no earlier or greater access still finds its way into the 74 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.303" offset="1833120">Then a necessity, you must look to this particular enforcement proceeding to determine what discovery rules are applicable and what access is allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.933" offset="1951716">Congress did not intend to say that all enforcement proceedings must have the set of discovery rules.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl L. Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="477.836" offset="1991317">Congress was focusing particularly on a set of cases which Congress felt constituted a judicial distortion of the original intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.797" offset="2031128">Congress was not writing on a clean slate in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.436" offset="2045652">It identified in particular four cases from the District of Columbia Circuit, none of which had anything to do with litigation that was then ongoing and indeed in some of them it was pretty far fetched that litigation could ever be ongoing and in one of them, the one dealing with the papers on the death of President Kennedy, the Court said there was no possibility there could be any further litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.186" offset="2152650">Congress was particularly upset about those decisions, but Congress mentioned no decision with which it was upset that dealt with an ongoing enforcement proceeding.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="527.260" offset="2189012">Its primary concern was to undo the decisions of the Court that had read the exemption broadly as including anything that had ever been prepared generically in connection with any enforcement proceeding, is that not right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_l_taylor" startTime="540.703" stopTime="632.339">
            <label>Mr. Carl L. Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="540.703" offset="2242720">That is right sir and I think it is also significant to note that in the catalogue of judicial distortions that Congress identified, it did not include any of the substantial number of Appellate Court decisions, not only District Court, but Appellate Court decisions which had protected Board witness statements prior to hearing under the 1966 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.894" offset="2335507">There have been quite a number of such decisions because the matter has been litigated heavily and there was not a single reference in the legislative history to any of those decisions as being a judicial distortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.750" offset="2390886">We suggest that that matches perfectly with Senator Hart?s comments when he specifically disclaimed any intention to radically depart from the intention of the 1966 Act and then referred to the original intent as not to allow any earlier or greater access.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.105" offset="2492346">The focus of the 74 amendment was exactly what has been suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.543" offset="2522126">It was this refusal to provide access without regard to the enforcement proceeding or the relationship with the information to the enforcement proceeding or the enforcement proceeding interest in keeping that information from being disclosed.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.086" offset="2680323">Congress has determined as a matter of law that there shall be no earlier or greater access, that Congress has determined that that is an inherent harm, that it is not going to impose through the FOIA and that it is not permissible, consistent with the statute and the congressional intent for the Court to come behind and say, well, we do not think that five days earlier are greater access.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.420" offset="2981567">Now, that rule allows the public in general the same access to information in ongoing litigation as the litigants have.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.433" offset="3489701">That you have got to look at the original Act and trace the history of this legislation, look at the evils that Congress was trying to cure and look at what Senator Hart said he was not proposing to do and one of the things he was not proposing to do was to interfere with the concept of no earlier or greater access so that sets the framework for what those words mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.181" offset="3616656">Now, the Fifth Circuit suggests and just to get back to the point that was raised, the Fifth Circuit suggests that there is no presumptive damage done to the balance struck by the Board between discovery and protection by an order that the statements be disclosed five days in advance because the statements will become public at the hearing in any event and because little intimidation is likely to occur in such a short period.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.997" offset="3723967">Now, we contend that the earlier or greater access concept is sufficient to answer that question, but it also ought to be pointed out that the harm from any premature release of the identity of expected testimony of witnesses in enforcement proceeding is precisely the danger that they can be persuaded to alter their testimony and that there is no answer to suggest as the Fifth Circuit did that the intimidator may be prosecuted after the fact before the testimony is altered, there is no amount of after the fact prosecution that is going to get that case back.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.426" offset="3861685">That testimony has altered that case may be lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.697" offset="6618752">In the alternative, we asked the Court to rule that investigatory witness statements are protected by Exemption 5 of the FOIA as work product except of course for the use of Jencks statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.350" offset="6661384">This Court has already held in Sears that Exemption 5 includes the work product privilege was well as the executive privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.869" offset="6691373">While the executive privilege protects only deliberative material and that is of course what this Court ruled in the Mink case, the work product privilege protects trial preparation material which these statements clearly are under Hickman v. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.270" offset="6753022">In Sears, the Court referred to the work product rule of Hickman as applicable to government attorneys in litigation, and therefore, within the scope of Exemption 5, we suggest that since the statements in question are protected by Hickman that it follows that they are protected by Exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.841" offset="6843301">Now, I might just finally point out that this Court itself, really going to both points for a minute, this Court itself has emphasized that the purpose of the FOIA is not to serve the needs of a particular litigant and they are, therefore, necessarily not to provide discovery, but to satisfy the public interest and the public interest of what the Board?s investigation shows in this proceeding is going to come out in the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.218" offset="7264813">The First Circuit in Good Friend v. Western said and I quote, ?We do not believe that Congress intended to transfer from the Board to the Courts the case-by-case adjudication of discovery disputes in unfair labor practice proceedings.?</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.721" offset="7330850">Such case-by-case adjudication is precisely what the First Circuit would require whether the requirement of the Board shows specific harm in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.656" offset="7370557">The recent experience of Federal Courts with subtle discovery suggest that those delays will be crippling and they will occur in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.664" offset="7410576">They will be FOIA case within every Board case and we suggest in light of this Court?s admonition in Air Force v. Rose that the FOIA is intended to be a practical workable statute and that the exemptions are intended to be practical and workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.849" offset="7475360">That the First Circuit is right that, that is inherently impractical and unworkable and will impose crippling delays upon all enforcement procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.125" offset="7556444">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.651" offset="7570550">The primary issue here before the Court is whether a government agency is going to be allowed to deny a valid request under the Freedom of Information Act as amended by giving a categorical per se response of denial without any meeting whatsoever of its statutory burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.933" offset="7647663">Under Section 55284 (b) of the Amended Act, the burden proof is squarely on the government in this case in a de novo proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.880" offset="7691445">The 74 amendments also provided for in camera inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.251" offset="7708894">There were some substantial revisions in the 74 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.366" offset="7729374">Now, at the District Court hearing in this case the Board presented no evidence whatsoever to support its claimed exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.107" offset="7772320">This was even after the Court reminded the Board that it had the burden of proof and I think in the appendix on page 71, the Board admits there that it presents no evidence in this case it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.581" offset="7826237">On page 91 of the appendix, the Court after having reminded the Board that it had the burden of proof in this case inquired us to the nature of these statements whether the statements were unique in any way, whether there was anything unusual in these particular statements that would cause an interference or whether it was that Board's position, a per se position here that the giving of virtually any statement regardless of who gave that statement or what might be included in that statement would be interference and the Board accepted the later position of per se approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.958" offset="7975761">This is of course an approach that in toto would exclude the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.884" offset="8007526">It runs contrary to the segregable portion added in the 74 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.317" offset="8037201">The Board here is claiming a blanket immunity from any turning over of this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.251" offset="8060921">This was despite Senator Kennedy's remark during the consideration about the senate that there were no blanket exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.061" offset="8092163">There is nothing in the statute specifically exempting investigatory statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.218" offset="8116823">Now, I think in one of the amicus briefs, Freedom of Information Clearinghouse, page 13 of that brief Exemption 3 as I understand it exempts from disclosure a document that would have a statutory exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.569" offset="8186204">There is no statutory exemption in this case, although Congress is well aware that the Board and other government agencies all have investigatory statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.090" offset="8228313">Quite to the contrary Congress in the 74 amendments did away with a stonewall categorical approach that had been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.429" offset="8261646">These four cases that were the DC circuit cases were illustrative of that particular approach, a blanket rubber stamp type approach and that was what they sought to turn around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.764" offset="8315040">It was a mechanical and wooden as that phrase has been bannered about, test and Congress was focusing here in the 74 amendments with regard to Exemption 7 in particular on the effect of the disclosure with regard to the enforcement proceeding.</text>
