            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="10.435" offset="121687">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.669" offset="138615">And the petitioners Franco construction company who is the employer in this Title 7 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.477" offset="165887">Frunco contracted to reline a blast furnace in the Chicago area, because of highly specialized nature of the work, the superintendent of the job did not accept applications of the job site but rather hired only brick layers whom he knew to be experienced and competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.517" offset="234014">Respondents fully qualified black brick layers were among the brick layers who unsuccessfully applied for employment at the site of the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.792" offset="271108">They brought suit claiming employment discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.516" offset="302037">The District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago ruled in  favor of the employer holding that the respondents had not proved a case of discrimination under what is called the disparate-treatment theory of McDonnell Douglas corporation against Green, a case we decided several terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.881" offset="379464">The Court Of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the judgment in favor of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.997" offset="399944">It held that the respondents had made out a prima facie case of discrimination and contrary to the findings of the District Court, if the employer had not proved that its hiring practices were justified as a business necessity because the employer could have used alternative hiring practices which would have satisfied its business needs and at the same time allowed it to consider the maximum number of minority applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.910" offset="507568">In an opinion filed today with the clerk we reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.850" offset="527317">While the Court Of Appeals was justified in concluding that respondents had made out a prima facie case of discrimination under McDonnell Douglas, the Court's imposition of a hiring method which might have enabled the employer to consider and perhaps, higher, more minority employers, finds no support in either the nature of the prima facie case or the Title VII's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.022" offset="616029">Courts may not impose such a remedy on an employer at least until a violation of Title VII has been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.466" offset="641838">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan joined.</text>
