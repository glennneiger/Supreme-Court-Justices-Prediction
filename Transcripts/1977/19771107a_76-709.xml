            <text syncTime="93.903" offset="456065">No Mr. Justice because the fact of this case is that complaint which filed and there was a motion to dismiss on the grounds of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.096" offset="492846">There has been no answer filed on this case yet and all of those questions are open under the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.147" offset="581035">Well, the problem Mr. Justice is the District Court dismissed this suit and the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal saying that the immunity in this case was not what the District Court held and therefore as the case now stands it goes back to the District Court to consider these other issues and we have brought the case here because we think the threshold ruling on immunity was erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.743" offset="1103484">Well, the only one that I could see that they rely on that conceivably might be with Section 1331 which is the federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.859" offset="1143922">I think you have to stretch that a bit to say that that is the kind of thing involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.672" offset="1171193">But that would seem to be the only one under which they might possibly be a basis here or it were the Bivens type of suit alleging violations of the First and Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.389" offset="1333989">As I say, we have not focused on this question, this issue because this was not the case as we sought that came up to this court from the Court of Appeals decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.619" offset="1450913">The only motion that was filed for want of jurisdiction was in respect to the suit against the Department of Agriculture in the commodity credit authority and that was on the ground that was barred by sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.468" offset="1502322">There was no claim, no suit, just motion made to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in the sense of the court had not had its jurisdiction properly invoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.293" offset="1545685">I suspect Mr. Friedman that the dialog continues that may well develop to be the case but we will affirm that up to the end of the argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="375.679" offset="1583197">We will be if the court wishes we would of course submit a memorandum on this topic.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.198" offset="1605244">Now, the issue on the case is I suppose by the Court of Appeals decision is whether these government officials who conducted this administrative proceeding have absolute immunity as we contend only qualified immunity as the Court of Appeals held.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.414" offset="1678178">And the critical significance of that distinction, of course, is that under absolute immunity, the issues are relatively narrow whether the official is active within the scope of his authority and whether the action was discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.494" offset="1730423">Whereas on the qualified immunity, you get into the whole problem of motive and intent and this involves a far more sweeping examination and the kind of thing that normally cannot be disposed off summarily on either motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.156" offset="1801058">The Commodity Exchange Act provides a comprehensive regulatory system for the commissions futures business and under the Act people who are so called the commissions futures merchants are required to register with the Secretary of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.744" offset="1871484">The secretary has promulgated a regulation that requires these individuals to meet certain minimum capital balances and to file reports on their balances.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.058" offset="1916728">The respondent Mr. Economou, and his corporation were registered with the Department of Agriculture as futures commission merchants and he submitted one of these reports on his minimum capital situation and this raised some questions within the Department of Agriculture over the correctness of his report and whether in fact he was in compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.360" offset="2009933">As a result of this, an audit was directed of his books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.759" offset="2027487">The audit was made and eventually the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture issued an administrative complaint subsequently amended and broadened, charging that Mr. Economou and his corporation had willfully violated the minimum capital regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.054" offset="2096660">In accordance with the standard practice in the Department of Agriculture, this complaint was made available in the department’s press room with a cover sheet that stated exactly summarized what the complaint alleged and pointed out that the mere issuance of this complaint did not constitute any adjudication of violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.490" offset="2174400">A hearing was held before a hearing examiner of the department who found that Mr. Economou had committed these willful violations, the hearing examiner proposed that Mr. Economou's registration be suspended for 90 days and for that period, he would be barred from any trading in the commodities markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.159" offset="2249110">Under the statute, the Secretary of Agriculture has delegated to the judicial officer of the department, the authority to hear appeals in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.511" offset="2294563">This matter was appealed to the judicial officer who upheld the decision of the hearing examiner and imposed this punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.267" offset="2333538">The Court of Appeals set aside this judicial order on the ground that the finding of willfulness was erroneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="595.101" offset="2460911">But coupled to that complaint at the very end was a claim for $32 million in damages and then at a later stage in the proceeding the complaint was amended to expand on the claims and also to add another defendant who was the Judicial Officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.802" offset="2563729">Let me give the chronology.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.707" offset="2571357">The Hearing Examiner had decided the Administrative Proceeding adversely to Mr. Economou.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.637" offset="2595076">He had appealed from that decision to the Judicial Officer and then he brought while at appeal to the Judicial Officer was pending, before the Judicial Officer had heard argument in the case, the present complaint was filed seeking both to enjoin further administrative proceedings and seeking the damages of $32 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.463" offset="2678354">After the injunction was denied by the District Court, then the case proceeded to decision before the Judicial Officer, then the decision of the Judicial Officer was taken to the Second Circuit and the Second Circuit reversed that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.764" offset="2747527">And in the interim, the complaint was amended as I say to expand somewhat on the causes of action and also to bring in as a defendant, the Judicial Officer who had decided the case against Mr. Economou.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.468" offset="2798309">The complaint named 12 individual defendants starting with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Assistant Secretary who had issued the complaint, the Administrator of the Commodity Exchange Authority who directed the whole proceeding in order of the audit, the Regional Director in New York under whose supervision the audit was conducted, three auditors who had gone in audited his books, a man named Davis who was a lawyer in the General Councils Office of the Department of Agriculture who had tried the case for the government, the Hearing Examiner who had initially decided it and the Judicial Officer who had affirmed the Hearing Officers’ decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.866" offset="2959954">The amended complaint said that by maliciously and wrongfully instituting these proceedings against Mr. Economou, the people under the Department of Agriculture had tried to injure his reputation and put him out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.787" offset="3027664">And the complaint suggests that they did these things because he had been very critical of the way these people were administering the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.781" offset="3071549">More specifically, he makes three claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.594" offset="3082834">He says first, the institution of the proceedings was unauthorized because the department had not given him a warning letter, which they normally would do and thus afforded him the opportunity to bring these mistakes into line to correct any deficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.881" offset="3164023">Secondly, they said he had no authority to issue a sanction of any sort because prior to the time the sanction was issued, he had seized operating as a futures commission merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.028" offset="3220552">And third, the defendants were charged with issuing a defamatory press release, which I assume has reference to the release of the complaint in the covering memorandum to the press office.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.358" offset="3309891">Oh, the press release itself is not set forth in the appendix but the cover sheet to the press release is set forth at page 150.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.749" offset="3363494">All that there was, was that there was a cover sheet and the copy of the administrative complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.806" offset="3379690">The complaint was released to the press together with this cover sheet, which is set forth at page 150.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.834" offset="3411768">Now, at the earliest stage of this case when Mr. Economou -- let me add one other thing, the complaint set forth ten different causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.115" offset="3456908">Four of which were asserted to violate the respondent’s constitutional rights, rights under the due process clause and his rights to free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.985" offset="3500376">And as I have indicated, he sought damages of $32 million, which have broken down into various segments, six million for this, four million for that, 800,000 for something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.764" offset="3543530">Now, at the earlier stage of the proceedings in opposing his application for a stay of the Administrative Proceedings, the defendants had filed an affidavit by the petition of Mr. Davis, the lawyer of the Agriculture Department that set forth in detail the functions performed by each of the individual defendants with respect to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.580" offset="3654811">On the basis of that affidavit, the defendants then moved to dismiss this suit on the ground that was barred by the doctrine of official immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.565" offset="3686785">The District Court so held and did dismiss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.134" offset="3700996">The Court of Appeals reversed holding that while this courts decision in bar if it had been the last word on this subject might well induce them as it had the District Court to hold that these people were protected by official immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.120" offset="3764944">It believed that the more recent decisions of this court involving the immunity of State Officials sued under Section 1983 of Title 42 suggested that there has been a change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.456" offset="3818338">And they thought that under these new cases, a qualified immunity, the good faith and reasonable ground tests suggested in Scheuer against Woods would be adequate to protect these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.770" offset="3867553">Now as we see the case, there are two basic issues in the case, the first is whether the absolute immunity that this court recognized in Barr against Matteo is still a sound doctrine and if so whether the more recent cases under Section 1983, now indicate that only qualified immunity is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.035" offset="3956578">The reason for absolute immunity have been stated many times, and I cannot find any better statement than what Learned Hand said many years ago in Gregoire against Biddle which we have set forth to pages 17-18 of our brief and which this court quoted from extensively in bar and because of the time I will not quote it but what Learned Hand said in effect was, it goes without saying he began that if in fact a government official has misused his authority and has injured someone, it would be monstrous to deny that person recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.676" offset="4095131">But he said the problem is you cannot tell that until the case has been tried and therefore if you permit people to make these charges and force the respondent to defend on the merits, this is likely to inhibit all but the most fearless and all but the most vigorous from acting as they should act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.185" offset="4181231">Because as he said “again and again the public interest calls for action which may turn out to be founded on a mistake in the face of which an official may laid upon himself hard put to it to satisfy a jury of his good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.733" offset="4243402">And he said, it is so often the case the answer must be found in a balance between the evils inevitable and either alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.434" offset="4270256">In the instance that has been thought in the end, better to leave and un-redress the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.939" offset="9608222">The factual circumstances surrounding this case are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.886" offset="9624000">I should point out that this case was decided on the district level on a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.993" offset="9652421">There was no discovering in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.895" offset="9664020">There were no affidavits attached to the motion to dismiss and we must therefore regard the allegations and the complaint as being true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.330" offset="9705816">Now, the factual circumstances are these; Mr. Economou had long been in the commodities business as a member of one of the more established exchanges in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.303" offset="9757642">He, through the years, had come to some conclusions about the way the commodity business in his particular area was being run and he felt that there were substantial problems of the commodities industry and with the regulatory agencies that were regulating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.676" offset="9827233">At that time, the regulatory agency was the Commodity Exchange Authority which was a portion of the Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.424" offset="9854191">He made it known, very well known his complaints about both the Commodity Exchange Authority and about the industry itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.801" offset="9891703">He set off on his own leaving the Chicago Mercantile position that he had and establishing his own exchange registering and offering with the Security and Exchange Commission, registering some other trading organizations with the Security and Exchange Commission, preparing to register his exchange known as the American Board of Trade with the SCC, and doing a number of other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.896" offset="10012075">He formed an organization which he was and still is the President of, called the American Association of Commodity Traders I believe and this was designed to change the concepts which existed in the commodities business at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.750" offset="10083442">Now people, and this is all alleged in the complaint and also in the affidavit which is the first part of the appendix, people in the industry and people who are regulating the industry took umbrage at this particular activity of Mr. Economou.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.494" offset="10322410">In any event, as I say, these matters were published as a matter of record and there were other people who were also pointing at the Commodity Exchange Authority in the way the commodities business was being regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.524" offset="10378625">Eventually Congress did away with the Commodity Exchange Authority and set up the commodity futures trading commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.233" offset="10405375">Congress itself feeling it and I think properly so, that there were something wrong with the way the industry was being regulated at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.532" offset="10434632">An independent agency was set up in 1974 parallel to the Securities and Exchange Commission which now regulates the commodities business in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.640" offset="10475069">In addition, just a to get a little bit technical for a second, Mr. Economou felt that it was too big a spread between the bidding asked price on the various exchanges and he looked to eliminate that bidding spread.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.615" offset="10518955">He felt that they should be a specialist on the floor of the exchanges as they are on the securities exchanges to make an orderly market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.882" offset="10548003">All these things did not sit well as we alleged in the complaint with the industry and with the regulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.671" offset="10575171">Now, he was withdrawing from the supervision of the Commodity Exchange Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.483" offset="10598367">He was closing out his business and was no longer involved in this particular business and he was in the process of closing out his accounts and as a matter of fact he closed out all of his accounts before the second amended complaint came down.</text>

            <text syncTime="2777.446" offset="11190302">He proceeded pro se up the ladder to appeal this decision and appear himself before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals without the assistance of an attorney and the Court of Appeals said that at least as a minimum, since there was admittedly no willfulness involved in this particular case, they dismissed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.468" offset="11270341">There may have been 25 other grounds for the dismissal also but they said since it did not meet the test of willfulness, a threshold test, therefore the entire matter was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.768" offset="11319556">In the hearings that were held by the way, in the administrative hearings that were held below, the petitioners admitted that if they had informed Mr. Economou of the fact that they were going to come down with this particular allegation, that he would have and all likely had corrected it and therefore there would have been no need to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.856" offset="11415896">In addition, it was admitted in one of the administrative hearings that the statement that his business was losing a capital at the rate of $4,000.00 a month was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.764" offset="11455497">It was an erroneous statement, a very substantial and harmful erroneous statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.871" offset="11479948">This particular action as has been explained by Mr. Friedman was commenced to the idea of attempting to state these administrative proceedings, and as generally happens, these attempts do not bear fruit because the courts are probably quite concerned about protecting the public in a case where it is alleged, that a firm is under capitalized.</text>

            <text syncTime="2929.319" offset="11797701">Now, as anyone in the securities or commodities business knows when you receive an announcement in the press that indicates that the capital of firm is diminishing at a rate of $4,000.00 a month, the chances of your continuing in business, especially small firm, among the members of the industry are very, very selective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.162" offset="11901146">The allegations in the complaint to get to the question of jurisdiction,the allegations in the complaint are one of the reasons that the entire proceedings here would commenced was to chill the speech of this gentleman who was athorn in the side of the Commodity Exchange Authority which was being subject to other criticism at the time also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.606" offset="11982857">And to chill his freedom of speech as I said and to take his business, to destroy his business, and to deprive him of his both First and Fifth Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3827.818" offset="15391732">We have in our brief before the court raised that issue and I wish to point to a recent decision that is referred to by the petitioners in this particular case where in the Expeditions Unlimited versus Smithsonian where in Judge Rookie's concurring opinion, he states that there are some serious question if they had to review the issue ab initio as to whether or not these Smithsonian which we regard as a Federal Institution was amenable to suit, but under those circumstances he would have to reconsider the whole matter in view of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.608" offset="15590890">It has been said that historically the concept of the sovereign immunity which had been recognized by this court, and by others was something that should not have been made part of our heritage from our English brethren in a sense that at some of the earlier cases have said the people were presumably sovereign in the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.087" offset="15700813">There was no sovereign and there was no sovereign to grant the petitioner, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.557" offset="15718681">And as such it was error from the inception to grant sovereign immunity to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.055" offset="15748669">That has been said and that I have realized that all that is gone since the initial time till today, it is a difficult argument to sustain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.337" offset="15785868">But I think there is something to be said for considering that particular, your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.801" offset="15851696">I think that it is interesting that the Expedition Unlimited Case that makes reference to the Economou Case and it finds the Second Circuit its decision not in accord with its feeling however if the separate opinions are read, I think the separate opinions, the concurring opinions indicate that there is very serious doubt in the minds of at least three of the Justices in the District Court of Columbia as to whether or not Barr versus Matteo has the same vigor as it did in view of the decision in Scheuer vs. Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.842" offset="16019820">It is our feeling at any rate that Barr versus Matteo does not grant immunity to all Federal officials irrespective of their positions and their activities but only to those requiring having policy making position enacting within the scope of their authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.217" offset="16093381">It seems to me that others are very well protective by a good faith reasonable defense to suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="4031.808" offset="16207693">That is a serious problem your Honor and yet people in private life and private industry, they are subject to suit and it does not prevent them from acting vigorously in corporate activity outside directors of corporations have been subject to more vigorous suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.773" offset="16311556">Questions at disclosure had been raised to a new level by the Securities and Exchange Commission among corporate officers and corporate officers are subject to greatest scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.120" offset="16357009">People in the Commodities and Securities business, not only are they subject to suit individually under 10B5 for their own wrongdoing but for failure to supervise under the New York Stock Exchange Laws and under the laws in NASD.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.605" offset="16414896">Private individuals and Private industry are subject to suit and they seem to be able to vigorously carry out their activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="4093.068" offset="16452722">Why should they be any less subject to suit provided that they are given a good faith reasonable immunity, so when they act in good faith and reasonably, they will not be subject to harassing suits?</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.743" offset="16507474">It seems to me that there should be indeed a balance between private world and the public world of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.831" offset="16539762">I think in view of the broadening responsibilities of private individuals in business that government and Federal officials act wrongfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.038" offset="16584588">I might point out that there has been tremendous growth of federal bureaucracy if you want to use that word and of other government and it is alleged that there is a feeling among people that they have lost control over these bureaucratic institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.636" offset="16655014">They do not know how to relate to them and if they feel they are wrong and that they have a right to suit, it seems to me that it would help to bring legitimacy, the kinds of legitimacy to government.</text>
