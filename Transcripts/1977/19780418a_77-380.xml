            <text syncTime="130.568" offset="602237">Seeking review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, holding that water is a mineral subject to location under the federal mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.793" offset="635151">To put it in another way, the Court of Appeals held that the rights to water on the public domain are mineral rights which should be acquired pursuant to the federal mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.621" offset="678410">Since 1866, the federal mining laws have permitted citizens to discover and extract valuable mineral deposits on the public domain and to secure fee title to lands containing such discoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.886" offset="727520">A claimant must establish that he has discovered a valuable mineral deposit within the limits of each claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.401" offset="753538">To show the value of such a discovery, the claimant must establish that a person of ordinary prudence would be justified in the expenditure of both time and money with the reasonable expectation that minerals from such a claim could be marketed at a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.628" offset="810485">At the outset, none of the parties in this case viewed it as a water law case.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.463" offset="829816">The disputed issue was, rather, whether the respondent could show a valuable and marketable discovery of sand and gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.395" offset="861476">In 1942, respondent’s predecessor in interest had located more than 20 plaster mining claims in a narrow wash on public lands about 15 miles Northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.211" offset="920826">In the aggregate these claims, and several others located a few years later, cover about 500 acres of land and they encompass a massive deposit of an estimated 20 million cubic-yards of sand and gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.665" offset="982580">Until 1955 sand and gravel were subject to the federal mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.632" offset="1002433">But, in that year, Congress withdrew common variety minerals including sand and gravel from location under the mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.137" offset="1036497">The Secretary of Interior initiated administrative proceedings in 1965 contending that each of respondent’s 25 sand and gravel claims were invalid for want of discovery of a valuable mineral prior to this 1955 withdrawal date.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.009" offset="1103997">A hearing was conducted at which the Secretary presented the testimony of a mining engineer who stated that the excessive distance from these claims to the market in Las Vegas and the lack of water to wash the material prevented profitable marketing of this sand and gravel prior to the withdrawal date in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.604" offset="1186335">It is undisputed that water was first discovered on these claims in 1962, when respondent drilled a successful well on claim 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.596" offset="1226355">The presence or absence of water was important here because washing sand and gravel greatly increases its marketability.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.836" offset="1259269">The Interior Board of Land Appeals credited the testimony of the government’s expert witness and concluded that respondent had established a valuable discovery of sand and gravel on only one of the 25 claims, the one from which sizable deposits had actually been removed prior to 1955.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.992" offset="1335964">Mrs. Beale, would you help me out of my ignorance.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.980" offset="1359893">A plaster mine is a mine which involves the use of water, is it not?</text>

            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="323.682" offset="1374626">In most cases, I believe it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.706" offset="1382776">The difference between a load and a plaster claim, as I understand it, a load claim is one where there is a vein of the mineral running through so that often one can come with a pick or whatever to get at that mineral, whereas, the plaster claims usually involve a mineral more broadly dispersed throughout the geographic limits of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.946" offset="1459680">So very often in the case of, say, a gold-plaster claim, one would use water to wash out the other materials and get at the valuable mineral.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.802" offset="1523106">In the case of sand and gravel plaster claim, it is used to only wash the water.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.494" offset="1549959">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.987" offset="1559886">Respondent sought review of this decision in the District Court which satisfied the administrative decision as arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.806" offset="1595204">The Court held that the Interior Board had erred in crediting the testimony of the government’s expert witness, found credible the respondent’s evidence on the issue of marketability and it concluded that at least the claims numbered 1 through 16 had been proved valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.688" offset="1658733">Moreover, it concluded that the respondent should be permitted access to claim 22 in order to make use of the water produced by the well.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.021" offset="1692066">The District Court did not offer any legal basis for offering access to the water on claim 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.745" offset="1718919">The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the District Court with one significant addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.803" offset="1739190">It held that claim 22, itself, was also valid because the water that respondent had discovered on that claim was itself a locatable mineral under the mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.854" offset="1779315">The parties had neither briefed nor argued this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.277" offset="1793003">The court, however, looked to the mining laws and found that there was no provision that expressly defined water as a non-mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.353" offset="1825395">The court stressed the fact that the recovery procedures used in the case of many hard minerals required the use of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.782" offset="1855070">Therefore, it found that it should not assume that Congress had been unaware of what the Court called the necessary glove of water for the hand of mining, and it had made no provision for the necessary acquisition of water rights for the operation of such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.452" offset="1917764">Accordingly, it concluded that Congress must have intended that water itself, should be locatable as a mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.881" offset="1943468">In the case of claim 22, the Court held that the evidence established the discovery of a valuable mineral, first, because water has an intrinsic value in a dessert area.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.324" offset="1985264">Moreover, because respondent’s use of the water to wash the sand and gravel thereby increasing the value of the sand and gravel, show that there was a profitable market for the water and that it was a valuable mineral deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.581" offset="2046286">The government submits that the Court of Appeals conclusion that water is a locatable mineral disregards the intent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.366" offset="2085365">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.439" offset="2089649">In our petition, we note that there are other respects in which we believe the Court of Appeals had erred, but we did not raise those in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.965" offset="2123817">We believe that the decision disregards the intent of Congress as expressed in the mining laws themselves that the acquisition of private water rights on the public domain should be governed by state and local laws and, therefore, not by the federal mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.196" offset="2188706">The Court’s decision, in our view, also disregards the precedence of both this Court and of the longstanding administrative interpretation of the Department of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.201" offset="2228725">The premise of the Court of Appeals’ opinion is that Congress did not expressly define water as a non-mineral and that it made no expressed provision for the acquisition of water rights necessary to work mineral claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.655" offset="2398521">It specifies the minerals and I believe in both our petition and in our brief that there is a provision in the 1955 legislation indicating that there was no intent to interfere with State Water Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.462" offset="2453796">We think that that buttresses not only our conclusion that the mining laws do not affect water laws, but should water be held to be a locatable mineral, would make it impossible to somehow construe, in my view, the provision of removal of common varieties as applicable to water.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.701" offset="2534776">The premise of the Court of Appeals’ opinion was that since there was no expressed provision for the acquisition of water rights that are necessary to work many mineral claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.065" offset="2576154">The court thought that Congress must have intended to provide some mechanism so that miners could acquire these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.195" offset="2600709">Therefore, it must have intended the only provision which the Court sought hand, the mineral laws themselves, to apply to the acquisition of water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.886" offset="2635504">The premise for this reasoning is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.771" offset="2646998">The general mining law, since their inception in 1866, have provided separately for the right to mine valuable minerals on the one hand, and for the acquisition of water rights on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.779" offset="2695063">Congress did recognize from the outset the critical role that water played in mining operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.449" offset="2717737">But, instead of establishing a federal statutory system to govern the acquisition of private water rights on public lands as it set up a system for the right to acquire minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.161" offset="2760578">Instead, Congress chose to ratify the rights that were recognized under the state and the local laws that were developing in the erred regions to allocate water among the competing uses including mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.533" offset="2818048">Both the general mining laws enacted in 1866 and in 1870 contained separate provisions regarding water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.987" offset="2847932">These provisions were left unchanged when Congress enacted the 1872 Mining Law, and they are now codified as Sections 51 and 52 of Title 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.524" offset="2890041">They are reprinted in page two of the government’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.209" offset="2920761">Section 51, which was part of the Mining Law of 1866, provides that rights acquired by priority of possession to the use of water on public lands, rights that are recognized and acknowledged by local customs, laws, and decisions of the courts should be maintained and protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.088" offset="2992337">Then, in 1870, Congress enacted what is now Section 52 which provides additionally that any patents granted or homesteads allowed are subject to vested and accrued water rights acquired or recognized under Section 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.224" offset="3056807">Congress thus expressly provided in the mining laws themselves that the acquisition of private water rights on the public domain is governed by state and local law, not by the federal mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.529" offset="3106021">Other public land laws, particularly the Dessert Land Act of 1877, advents the same intent to sanction water rights acquired in accord with state law rather than to establish a new and separate system of federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="814.323" offset="3337257">The inclusion in the mining laws of these specific provisions for the acquisition of water rights precludes any inference that Congress intended the federal law of mining claims to govern the acquisition of water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.247" offset="3380934">The Court of Appeals, however, was apparently unaware of these provisions and of the decisions of this court construing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.981" offset="3407893">Contrary then to the Court of Appeals’ belief that it would be advancing the purposes of the mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.893" offset="3431507">Instead, its interpretation of the mining laws would defeat what this Court has recognized as Congress’ clear intent that the acquisition of such rights should be governed by the state and local laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.839" offset="3479259">Congress was well-aware that the Western states were gradually developing a system of water laws that was especially suited for the needs of that erred region.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.263" offset="3516980">Congress obviously intended that private water rights on the public domain would be acquired in accordance with this specially suitable system.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.313" offset="3553238">We believe, therefore, that a reading of the mining laws as a whole leaves no doubt as to Congress’ intent to treat water rights a separate and distinct from the right to mine valuable minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.720" offset="3594825">But even if these provisions were unclear, any possible doubt on the score has long since been removed by the administrative decisions of the Department of the Interior which is charged with regulating the acquisition of rights in the public lands.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="1069.945" offset="4359690">If Congress had not expressly provided in the mining laws that water rights acquired under state and local law should be acquired under state and local law and would be recognized by the federal government and if Congress had not in other statute, such as the Dessert Land Act, indicated that there was this division, that might have been a possible interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.086" offset="4456239">If this Court were to view the provisions as ambiguous however, the decisions of the Department of Interior beginning in the 1880s, shortly after the adaption of the mining law of 1872, resolved any doubt that department held unambiguously that water claims could not be patented under the mining law but must be acquired instead under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.951" offset="4547772">To the extent that the Court might find the statutes unambiguous, that doubt has long since been resolved by the consistent interpretation of the department charged with administering the public land laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.997" offset="4611928">That view of the statutes was reaffirmed as recently as 1976, in a comprehensive decision which we have reprinted in our petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.339" offset="4649336">We believe that, given the fact that this longstanding interpretation has prevailed for a century and has been the basis for a set old system of property rights, it should be virtually conclusive at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.693" offset="4702730">The recent decision on the Interior Board of Land Appeals on this point, to which I refer, convincingly demonstrates the soundness of that department’s view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.134" offset="4736480">They relied not only upon the theory of this court in the California Oregon Power Co. case, which looked to the structure of the mining laws themselves and the fact that Congress had provided on the one hand for the acquisition of water rights and on the other hand, for the acquisition for the right to mine valuable minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.723" offset="4814848">But, the Board also took a very common sense view of Congress’ intent in using the term “mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.605" offset="4842328">It recognized that if Congress had intended the mining laws and the use of the term “mineral” to be given the broadest possible definition of the term such that when one speaks of the division of all matter into animal, vegetable, and mineral and intended that all matter that could be classified as mineral in that sense to be locatable under the mining laws, then all the public lands will be mineral lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.314" offset="4957163">If this were so, there would have been no need for separate provisions in the many public land laws dealing with non-mineral lands permitting agricultural entry and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.650" offset="4994570">Congress clearly, as the Interior Board recognized, could not have intended the term “mineral” to be given such a broad definition which would make nonsense of the mining laws and of so many of the other public land laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.515" offset="5045979">The Board also noted, and this is an important consideration, that the location of water as a mineral would invite the widespread abuse of the mining laws by persons who were seeking public lands for other purposes who would attempt to take advantage of a widespread occurrence of water and the relative ease with which mining claims may be patented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1274.688" offset="5178681">The Legislative History of that provision indicates clearly that the location of sand and gravel claims were being misused and that it was being used to acquire land for residential purposes and all sorts of purposes not comprehended in the mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.475" offset="5237822">The Interior Board of Land Appeals concluded that the very same abuses would be invited if water, itself, which is of such common occurrence, could be located under the mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.577" offset="5274289">It is relatively easy to acquire a mining claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.235" offset="5292888">It would invite abuse for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.644" offset="5302501">We have no figures available that would tell precisely how many acres of public lands might contain water which could be discovered, but it seems relatively clear that millions of acres of public land would be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.655" offset="5366554">We believe that setting aside the long-established administrative and judicial construction of the mining laws would throw established rights into question and would, therefore, completely unsettle the law of water rights throughout the Western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.790" offset="5415141">The Court of Appeals’ decision, because it does not acknowledge the existence of the water rights provisions adapted as part of the mining laws, does not give a hint whether that court’s opinion should be viewed as holding that the location of mineral claims to water rights is the exclusive method by which private water rights on the public domain could be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.379" offset="5501450">Perhaps it might have intended that there was to be an alternative method to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.873" offset="5523393">But, if that decision were interpreted as holding that the only way that one could acquire water rights on the public domain is under the mineral mining laws, then private rights long since considered throughout the West would presumably be invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.557" offset="5582221">The respondent seeks to avoid this obviously undesirable result and to interpret the Court of Appeals’ decision somewhat more narrowly arguing that the mining law should be viewed as merely an alternative to state procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.082" offset="5632271">However, respondent offers no evidence that congress actually intended to create such an imaginable dual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.602" offset="5662364">Harmonizing the rights acquired under the two systems would be a difficult task and one would surely generate extensive litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.047" offset="5692144">Moreover, the mining laws were never designed to allocate water rights and we believe they are ill-suited to this task.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.017" offset="5720043">Respondent has failed to suggest any reason why this Court should reverse all prior judicial and administrative interpretations of the mining laws to reach such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.070" offset="5760271">We believe that the administrative interpretation of the mining claims, the decisions of this court, and an examination of the structure of the mining laws themselves, each compels a conclusion that Congress did not, in fact, intend water rights on the public domain to be located under the federal mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.685" offset="5826727">But, rather, that it intended that such rights would be acquired pursuant to state and local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.619" offset="5850446">We, therefore, respectfully submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed in so far that it holds that the water on claim 22 was subject to location under the mining laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.641" offset="6910495">Obviously, Your honor, we would have preferred for the Ninth Circuit to spell out in greater detail the basis for its holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.315" offset="6969218">We do wish to make it very clear that we are not contending, as the government appears to attribute to us, that with respect to vested water rights, pursuant to Section 9 of the 1866 Act and Section 17 of the 1870 Act, that rights which have already vested and rights which vest tomorrow should not be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.153" offset="7104533">That is not our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.894" offset="7115504">Our position, very simply, is that the plain language of the Act of 1872, which states that all valuable minerals maybe discovered, is what Congress meant to say and in the absence of a withdrawal by Congress, as you pointed out and as the government points out and it did in 1955 when it removed certain common variety minerals, in the absence of a withdrawal from the broad provisions of the 1872 Act of specified minerals that that general grant of authority prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.864" offset="7315393">Our position is that with respect to rights that have already vested, and that is the language of Section 9 and that is the language of Section 17, rights which have vested and accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.099" offset="7376310">Those rights remain vested and accrued, and nothing that this Court could decide in this case by affirming the lower court’s opinion would derogate from those vested rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.475" offset="7441826">The government argues that it would leave an unmanageable system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.058" offset="7472128">The government does not explain why the system is any more manageable today in circumstances where a state appropriation with respect to a given portion of water that runs during particular times of the year or particular specified flow and relieves to be claimed what is left of that residual of rights under state law is any more manageable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.629" offset="7770446">The answer to that is, in our view, that the very requirement that a demonstration be made that the mineral is valuable, the very requirement of the prudent man test, the very requirement of the marketability test is sufficient to insulate claims that would lead to abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.341" offset="7897297">We have no quarrel with the proposition that, of course, the tests are different under a state appropriation and under the mining laws of 1872.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.829" offset="7939301">But that does not, in our view, lead inexorably to the conclusion as the government would have it that when Congress said in 1866 and in 1870 that “we will respect those water rights that have vested and accrued under state law,” that it was saying that that was the only manner in which water rights could be obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2013.583" offset="8134279">The argument that the government makes about the longstanding interpretation of the interior department does not take into account that, as this court has made clear, while construction of legislation by departments charged with administering the legislation is indeed entitled the deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.392" offset="8269489">This court is not, thereby, permitted to abdicate its function of reviewing the wisdom and correctness of that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.172" offset="8324660">In particular, I cite the court to a decision, an opinion by Justice Harlan in Zuber v. Allen, 396US 109 at 328.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.793" offset="8435106">The abuse argument that is relied upon so heavily by the government, seems to me, was indeed answered, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, by what Congress did in the 1955 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.556" offset="8526221">When it was confronted with circumstances which demonstrated that abuses of the mining law had been taken place, the Congress responded and it did so on the basis of evidence before it, not on the basis of allegations about the horrible things that will happen, that might happen, that could happen if this Court interprets the law, as it appears to us, to be written.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.107" offset="13156373">Just one or two very brief points, first, on the court’s question as to generally what is a mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.624" offset="13186466">The government would contend that there is no one single definition of the term “mineral” for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.220" offset="13216872">I would point out to the court that, originally, the mining laws or at least at some point in their history were construed to apply to oil and gas which later then dealt with more specifically in the mineral leasing laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.692" offset="13258668">That is my understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.244" offset="13264937">I do not think that one can assume.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.680" offset="13306629">If one perceives on the hypothesis of the childhood game that everything is animal, mineral, or vegetables, certainly, water is a mineral.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="3314.278" offset="13337035">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.944" offset="13339752">We think that that kind of a very broad definition, as the Interior Board of Land Appeals said, just makes no sense in this context.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="3327.315" offset="13389176">Yes, I would think that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.227" offset="13392833">We would have to agree that within the broadest definition of the term “mineral” as an animal, vegetable, and mineral, water is included and dirt is included.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.533" offset="13422090">We do not think that there is any suggestion or any evidence but that is what Congress was thinking of when it allowed the exploration discovery of valuable minerals.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="3354.460" offset="13497741">I do not think that is quite the way I would phrase that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.007" offset="13507981">I think when we look at the mining statutes themselves, we see water treated separately.</text>

          <turn speaker="sara_sun_beale" startTime="3365.805" stopTime="3379.845">
            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="3365.805" offset="13543194">And with no provisions in the 1866 and 1870 mining laws themselves, then I would think we would rely upon the Interior Board of Land Appeals’ construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.993" offset="13579870">I would think that that would be very wavy as to how the Acts have been construed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3379.845" offset="13599305">And then you would say water was not intended to be a mineral.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="3382.116" offset="13608395">That is exactly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.049" offset="13616128">From the 1880s on and a whole series of decision which we find very persuasive.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3388.401" stopTime="3392.063">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3388.401" offset="13633577">What do they say about mineral water?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sara_sun_beale" startTime="3392.063" stopTime="3492.338">
            <label>Ms. Sara Sun Beale</label>
            <text syncTime="3392.063" offset="13648206">That goes to springs case that that is not a mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.125" offset="13672448">The only other point that I would like to draw to the court’s attention is that respondents have tried to emphasize the narrowness of this decision and the fact that if the mineral laws were construed as an alternative way of acquiring water rights, that really would not unsettle the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.332" offset="13737231">The western water law would not throw established rights to question and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.175" offset="13752696">But, the very point upon which the Court of Appeals and respondent relied is the fact that a mining claim need not specify what mineral it is located for as the claims here did not indicate sand and gravel or water, unless someone later, these claims were located in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.442" offset="13829705">Now, at this late date, it is possible for respondents to claim that they were located for water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.291" offset="13849140">There are many claims outstanding that were located in 1940 and 1950 or whenever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.884" offset="13867530">It would be possible now to attempt to validate those on the theory that water was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.536" offset="13890100">One can imagine, of course, the difficulties that trying to harmonize those rights with the rights acquired under state law would cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.219" offset="13924790">The final point is that the Court of Appeals theory at least was that the value of the mineral deposit here was shown by the fact that water has an intrinsic value in the dessert region.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.938" offset="13971706">It seems to me if that construction were adapted, it would substantially lessen the impact on the prudent man and marketability test, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.594" offset="14006293">If you could find water, you could argue under this decision that your claim, just simply by showing water was present in an arid area which, would shell a valuable discovery.</text>
