            <text syncTime="18.322" offset="153255">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.803" offset="159211">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.640" offset="174467">This case, as was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in an unpublished, non precedential opinion, involves several Fourth Amendment questions, each arising out of the warrantless arrest one evening of the four teenage black males found one night in the crowded dwelling in Chicago, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.950" offset="255760">The director of the Illinois Department of Corrections, the respondent in this Court, asked this Court to resolve the Fourth Amendments questions on the basis of evidence received by the District Court at a hearing on an untimely motion to reconsider.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.354" offset="313334">This is precisely what the Court of appeals did.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.763" offset="323051">It relied on that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.471" offset="329843">It resolved quite disputed questions of fact in the first instance and it reversed the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.733" offset="354921">The first question which the Court, could resolve in this case and which could indeed be dispositive of all the other issues presented, is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in relying on the testimony which had been heard by the district judge in the untimely motion to reconsider.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.872" offset="419495">It is our position, that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain an untimely motion to reconsider and that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal from that untimely motion to reconsider and that what the Court of Appeals should have done, would have have been to dismiss this appeal.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="101.453" offset="485742">Well, if we reach that and decide it we need not decide any other questions, is that not so?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="105.907" stopTime="171.788">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman</label>
            <text syncTime="105.907" offset="503610">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.402" offset="509566">The other question which the Court could also resolve is whether it is appropriate for Court of Appeals to rely on an unpublished opinion (Inaudible) deprived its decision of precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.423" offset="557631">That is -- it is our position to that -- the use of that rule is interrelated with disposition in this case and that question could also be considered by the Court, but the only issue which the Court need to decide in order to grant Mr. Browder the primary relief which he desires is to find that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review the decision of the District Court and that the District Court's order granting Mr. Browder's application for writ of Habeas Corpus should be reinstated and Mr. Browder re-enlarged in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.113" offset="684377">The time limits in which a motion to reconsider maybe made have for the last 30 years been delimited by the ten days of Civil Rule 59.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.994" offset="735890">The motion to reconsider in this case was made 28 days after entry of the final order and was untimely under Rule 59.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.788" offset="767133">Mr. Flaxman, I suppose that is the argument is it not, as to what is the final order?</text>

            <text syncTime="178.929" offset="795659">The final order is the order which disposes of the case, the order which leaves nothing to be done except to execute what the district judge --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="187.788" offset="831081">Well, that has to be your position, but I suppose one could argue that January 26th order was the final order?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="193.182" stopTime="245.045">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman</label>
            <text syncTime="193.182" offset="852710">That argument could be made, but it would be contrary to the type of final order which is appropriate in Habeas Corpus cases and which this Court has in directing the lower courts to enter when an order less than -- an unconditional release is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.390" offset="913523">This goes back to, I think Chessman v. Teets where there was some problem in the way the State Court record had been prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.082" offset="944243">This Court felt properly, I believe, that it would be improper to release Mr. Chessmen because of this procedural error which could be cured and directed the District Court to enter such orders as would be appropriate to allow the State a reasonable time to cure the error, failing which the prisoner would be released. That is what the district judge did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.095" offset="1024387">He decided that the petition should be granted and he told Illinois that they have 60 days to retry Mr. Browder, failing which the writ would be executed.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="245.045" offset="1060122">Your position is in affect that the judgment is to the invalidity that state conviction was final and the state was just given a couple alternatives as what to do in consequence of that determination?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="255.744" stopTime="282.566">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman</label>
            <text syncTime="255.744" offset="1102963">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.325" offset="1105262">That is the appropriate kind of the final order when an order less to have that release is appropriate and the State could have retried Mr. Browder if it had acted within that 60 days or if the courts, the state courts which you have congested, I am sure the warden could have come to the district judge and say we need more time to retrial because there are delays in State Court and the district judge I think would have extended that time and they would have had an ample time to retrial if that is what they wish to do.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="282.566" stopTime="288.113">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="282.566" offset="1210170">Of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.851" offset="1211319">The district judge did stay the earlier order pending for the hearing, did he not, pending an evidentiary hearing?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman</label>
            <text syncTime="288.113" offset="1232426">That is correct and I think that he erred in doing that, but whether he erred in doing that is not really before this Court. Yes, we did seek review at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.163" offset="1268579">We objected to the district judge, proceeding with the hearing, pointing out to him that the time in which he can alter or amend earlier order had elapsed, but the district judge proceeded with the hearing and received evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.438" offset="1337752">The argument that is raised by the Director as to why that order, granting the petition was not the final order is the claim that that order left unanswered, the question of whether or not an evidentiary hearing would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.140" offset="1392504">That is a difficult point to understand because it seems obvious, that when the district judge said, this petition should be granted on the State Court record, he was making a decision that no hearing was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.476" offset="1441824">He was making a decision that the state should appeal his order or the state should retry Mr. Browder or the state should release him from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.180" offset="1476723">And what the State did, rather that to follow one of those three permissible alternatives was to file an untimely motion to reconsider and asked the district judge to hear further evidence and re-adjudicate the lawfulness of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.616" offset="1538372">The district judge lacked jurisdiction to hold that hearing and the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal from --</text>

            <text syncTime="371.396" offset="1565539">What would have happened if the State had made that motion one day after the original order was filed?</text>

            <text syncTime="377.161" offset="1588632">Then it would be timely under Rule 59, the time to appeal would be tolled.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="382.142" offset="1608485">Is there anything in this record to explain why they did not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_n_flaxman" startTime="385.522" stopTime="439.390">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman</label>
            <text syncTime="385.522" offset="1622068">There is nothing in this record to explain why they did not and there is never been any explanation by the state or by the Director as to why they waited 28 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.549" offset="1658117">This rule is not a novel rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.673" offset="1666686">It is -- there is no explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.689" offset="1674731">The other fact about the untimeliness is that the district judge in this case did nothing to lull the Director into failing to appeal within the 30 days of Rule 4 of the Appellate Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.643" offset="1722483">The motion was filed on the 28th day.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.268" offset="1733037">Under local rules, in the Urban District of Illinois could have been presented in Open Court for a ruling at that time, but instead it was filed in absolutely dormant under District Court's calender.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.179" offset="1772638">So, there is a decision by the Director to rely upon the presumed power of the district judge to reconsider a final order after more than ten days have elapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.502" offset="1821957">The district judge lacked that power and should not have received evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.390" offset="1837526">Mr. Flaxman, the respondent's brief, places some way down a decision of this Court a couple of years ago in United States against Dieter which involved a criminal prosecution rather than a civil one and I do not know if you filed a reply brief or not, how do you -- how do you distinguish Dieter?</text>

            <text syncTime="459.785" offset="1919133">Well, Dieter is consistent with our position. Dieter and United States v. Healy arose in cases under the criminal rules where under Rule 4 (b) of the appellate rules, there is no tolling rule on motions to reconsider.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.525" offset="1974095">So that -- in criminal cases, when a motion to reconsider is filed by the Government in the time in which an appeal can be perfected, the filing of that motion tolls the time to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.702" offset="2014741">The same rule is inapplicable to cases where appealability is determined by Rule 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="489.554" offset="2038147">Dieter states the general rule which is applicable that only timely motions to reconsider, stay the time to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.499" offset="2065941">In Dieter, a time, in a criminal case, a timely motion is when filed within the time in which the government can appeal, in Habeas Corpus case, in a Civil case, in any case where appealability or where the time to appeal is governed by Rule 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="510.060" offset="2120171">A timely motion to reconsider is one made within the ten day period of Rule 59.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.606" offset="2138352">But is Dieter and entirely Dependant on provisions of the Rules?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth N. Flaxman</label>
            <text syncTime="518.405" offset="2153608">It is dependent upon the absence in Rule 4 (b), that any provision, any rule of statute authorizing petitions for the hearing, as in United States v. Healy.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.756" offset="2191015">That is what differentiates this case from that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.631" offset="2202509">The argument is also made, that Rule 4 (a) does not apply to Habeas Corpus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.590" offset="2230304">The contention is that the Tolling Rules of 4 (a) are in direct contravention of the conformity clause of Civil Rule 81 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="546.689" offset="2266666">But if we look at the predecessor of Civil Rule 81 (a) (2), that is former Civil Rule 81 (b) which was in existence, when appealability, when the time to appeal a set by the Civil Rules, we see that the Tolling Rule from the Civil Rules were expressly and fully applicable to Habeas Corpus proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.771" offset="2347019">The other Civil Rules were applicable only in so far as Habeas Corpus practice that confirm to practice in civil cases, but the civil rules, when they govern appeals, were fully applicable to appeals in Habeas Corpus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.415" offset="2401667">So, what we have is the applicability of the ten-day tolling time unless this Court concludes that the order granting the petition and leaving nothing to be done, but to appeal or to execute with the District Court for file and determine was not the final order, then the conclusion we have is that the motion to reconsider was untimely and that the appeal from the denial of the untimely motion to reconsider did not vest the Court of Appeals of Jurisdiction to review the merits of the Districts Court's final order, that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.563" offset="2562163">Even if the Court of Appeals did have jurisdiction and it is our position that it is clear it did not have jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals as the respondent in this Court resolved the Forth Amendment questions by making its own findings of fact by reading the testimony, heard by the district judge at the hearing under motion to reconsider in the light most favorable to the Warden who is the loosing party in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.866" offset="2675430">The ordinary rule followed by Courts of Appeals is that factual questions which are in dispute, which were in dispute are resolved on appeal in the light most favorable to support the Judgment entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.606" offset="2726421">If the Court of Appeals had followed that view, it would have decided the probable cause question in this case, the way the district judge had decided on the State Court Record.</text>

Powell says that there has to be a full and fair opportunity and when -- the question has not been adjudicated, I think full and fair opportunity has to be read together with Wainwright v. Sykes, to be that when the issue was not raised at the trial, the rule that has to be applied by the state courts to the determine if there is a full and fair opportunity would be to allow the prisoner to show cause for why it was not raised and prejudice resulting from default of trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.733" offset="3030904">That is the -- what the district judge did in this case. Before he adjudicated the the Fourth Amendment question, he decided whether or not the question had been waived by the failure of trial counsel to have raised it in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.004" offset="3087956">The Director argued that this question should be resolved in the State Court record in favor of a waiver under the precedent of that extent in the Seventh Circuit and the district judge considered that question and found that under that case which adapted standards are virtually identical to those adopted by this Court in Wainwright v. Sykes, but the question did not waive and should be considered in Federal Habeas Corpus as the Court said in Henry v. Mississippi when it made clear with the States can apply any procedural waiver rules that they feel are appropriate, but that if they nonetheless refuse to adjudicate a constitutional question, it is open to the Federal Courts to determine whether or not the procedural rules followed by the State Courts measured up to Federal standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.790" offset="6515117">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.581" offset="6526297">I would like to briefly address the issue of the arrest, the probable cause for the arrest and the nature of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.250" offset="6552942">I will keep my remarks very limited in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.714" offset="6566839">It is important to keep in mind exactly what the police knew, when they went to the Browder residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.203" offset="6584811">On January 29, they found out from the victim of the rape that her assailant was the brother of a person, the victim went to school with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.949" offset="6623786">She knew that he was dark complexed, male Negro in his late teens, approximately seventeen years of old, 17 years of age, his last name was Browder and he lived in 4000 West Block of West Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.740" offset="6674881">She narrowed it down to one block.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.441" offset="6697765">This information was received on January 29 by a homicide investigator Stan Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.360" offset="6721379">It was not until the 31st of January, two days later that Mr. Thomas conveyed this information to the Juvenile Authorities, who then went out and arrested him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.654" offset="6762548">On January 31st, the Juvenile Officers received the information about 4:00-4:30 in the afternoon and had made the arrest by six at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.885" offset="6799538">In that intertwining time they had located a Browder family on the block, they have located a juvenile record on one Tyrone Browder, who lived at 40,53 West Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.915" offset="6843632">They had personally interviewed the victim of rape themselves to verify the information that Mr. Stan Thomas gave them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.868" offset="6875397">They also called for a back up squad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.247" offset="6888981">At six o clock they proceeded to the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.395" offset="6901520">One of the thing I forgot that is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.741" offset="6910924">Before they went to the house the juvenile officer who was heading the investigation called the Browder residence and talked with the mother of Tyrone and then Ben Browder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.565" offset="6950212">He asked her if the sons were home and she said yes and he said would you mind keeping them there and until we get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.986" offset="6991904">The police then got into the car and went over to the Browder's residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.537" offset="7006114">In this time, Mrs. Browder had an opportunity to think over what she wanted to do when police came there, she wanted to change her mind since the phone conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.628" offset="7038506">The police arrived, knocked on the door, Mrs. Browder opened the door and the testimony of the police officers, invited them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.448" offset="7073719">They went in, no search was conducted, the arrest was made, Miranda warnings were given and the four gentlemen were taken to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.699" offset="7114784">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.340" offset="7117291">I take it you are conceding that the four were arrested at that time?</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond McKoski</label>
            <text syncTime="1764.237" offset="7136935">Your Honor, I believe that the real explanation -- I am not hesitant to conceive that for the purpose of argument, the four arrested, but I think what really happened in that context and the juvenile officer who was in charge of the investing so testified, they went to the house, they knew two Browder's would be there and they arrested both Browders because they both fit the description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.440" offset="7225752">They were two other young teenage black males there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.187" offset="7240694">The police knew that there was second assailant Sharon Alexander was raped by a man named Browder, but there was also another assailant with Browder at the time who also raped her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.988" offset="7283952">And so Mr. Conright (Ph) testified that he thought that may be one of the other two could have been the second assailant and that is why he asked the other two if they would go along to the police station to stand in line up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.647" offset="7346542">Mr. Conright testified, they volunteered to go with and that was how description of the events ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.140" offset="7368485">Once at the police station, arrest slips were filled out for all four youths, so I think that they were arrested, at any event arrested at the police station, when the arrest slips were filled up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.400" offset="7421566">I do not believe Mr. Conright thought that he was arresting them at the time at the house, but I do not think it is really important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.503" offset="7449987">I think the important point there is, not withstanding what Mr. Flaxman said, they were not arresting all four because they thought one of the four was a Browder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.962" offset="7487812">They knew who the two Browders were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.509" offset="7493977">The mother introduced the police officers to the two Browders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.474" offset="7509859">It was the other person the second assailant they thought might be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.263" offset="7544968">We argue in our brief that there was probable cause like the Seventh Circuit held at the warrantless entry, that warrant was not necessary for the entry because the entry was consented to and even if not consented to, it was acknowledged by Mrs. Browder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.596" offset="7610379">We also argue that in any event a warrant is not necessary to enter a private dwelling to effectuate an arrest and I would like to get back to that a little bit if I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.961" offset="7651757">I do feel compelled first though to address just very briefly Mr. Flaxman's initial argument and that was that the Court of Appeals never had jurisdiction to even consider this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.958" offset="7707763">There is dispute as to what was the final order, but right now I do not want to concede, but I am willing to assume, October 21st 1975 was a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.105" offset="7748410">That order was a minute order and a memorandum opinion, that was filed after respondent filed a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.122" offset="7780488">The petition was filed, a motion to dismiss was filed by the petitioner -- by the respondent and then later District Court granted the writ and impliedly denied the motion of dismissal though that was never specifically stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.243" offset="7848929">28 days after the writ was issued with a stay of 60 days to retry to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.693" offset="7874738">The respondent filed a motion, it was entitled motion for an evidentiary hearing and it was respondent's position --</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.487" offset="12257876">I would like to ask for brief speak -- speak briefly if I might citing the Stone v. Powell issue and Wainwright v. Sykes issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.940" offset="12307717">Assuming that, I am sorry, it is our contention basically that the search and seizure issue, the Fourth Amendment claim is not cognizable in a Habeas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.847" offset="12359335">And even if it is cognizable the defendant has, the petitioner has an in fact waived his right to present that issue in a Federal Habeas Corpus petition because he did not object the entry of the evidence in the trial court on the basis of unlawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.399" offset="12429552">Stone v. Powell requires an opportunity, the State gives an opportunity for a petitioner to raise a Fourth Amendment claim. The State of Illinois provide such a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.262" offset="12473020">A motion of suppress of evidence can be made before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.422" offset="12485664">The facts were not known at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.538" offset="12502068">This opportunity provided by the Illinois statutes safeguards the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule which was the main concern in Stone v. Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.325" offset="12549298">Simply put, as long as the police know that illegal seized evidence can be suppressed or will be suppressed by a State Court there is no incentive for them to disregard the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.937" offset="12591721">In fact, there is a deterrent because illegally seized evidence will not be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.625" offset="12622441">The fact that the defendant in trial court, the petitioner here did not choose to challenge the evidence in the State Court, does not detract from the effectiveness of the Illinois procedures in the deterring police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.433" offset="12677716">It would only have an effect under deterrence if we could assume that a police officer will think, well, I can seize this evidence illegally because the defendant's attorney probably would not raise the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.200" offset="12724736">I do not think that can be a valid assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.505" offset="12738006">The State did nothing to interfere with the opportunity, petitioner had in State Court to present his issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.313" offset="12777190">There was an opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.471" offset="12785863">The defendant did not take it, take advantage of opportunity, but it was there, and therefore, this purely Fourth Amendment Claim is not cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.179" offset="12824628">If it was cognizable, if it is cognizable the defendant did not raise the issue in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.414" offset="12857647">He did not raise the arrest issue on a motion of suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.356" offset="12869350">He did the arrest issue at trial using it to show that the police officers really did not know whether they were arresting that there was no warrant before arrest and investigation of rape, using it to show to jury that the police were not sure who committed the crime, and therefore, the Jury should not be sure who committed the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.098" offset="12948344">The petitioner's trial counsel knew the factual basis for an arrest claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.654" offset="12966526">He filed motions under the contemporary subjection rule so he is aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.862" offset="12983453">In fact, his efforts helped secure the petitioner's acquittal on the armed robbery charge, although he was convicted of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.387" offset="13017517">It was no challenge that he was competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.139" offset="13028488">Simply the petitioner is not shown cause why his failure to object in trial court should be excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.291" offset="13053148">Also important here is the reliability of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.322" offset="13065268">The inquiry identification was from an independent source, not the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.998" offset="13079897">The District Court and Trial Court held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.183" offset="13088674">The confession was purely voluntary. It was a volunteered statement after two eye witnesses identified the defendant in a line up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.147" offset="13116573">He admitted to one, denied the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.926" offset="13123678">He called the police officer over to speak to them, no interrogation whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.366" offset="13141441">Each statement was only a couple minutes long.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.468" offset="13149801">Miranda warnings were given three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.821" offset="13171221">In short it is our position that issue is not cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.211" offset="13184805">Secondly Wainwright v. Sykes application to that rule or at least one result that he waived the because there was no cause and there was no prejudice from the alleged Constitutional violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.252" offset="13644978">Well, if it had been, regardless of how it was labeled if the district judge construed it as a Rule 59 motion it would have tolled the time to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.312" offset="13677161">If it had been a Rule 60 (b) motion which could be filed any time after the notice of appeal should have been filed without tolling the time to appeal then there would be the standard for review from the denial of that motion would be right over if the district judge had abused his discretion in refusing to modify his earlier order and there is no abuse of discretion here, evidence before the district judge in hearing the motion to reconsider was contradictory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.253" offset="13792935">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.227" offset="13796906">That is exactly what we argued in the Court of Appeals that this motion should be viewed, as this appeal should be viewed as an appeal for the denial of Rule 60 (b) relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.747" offset="13830970">The Director conceded or represented an urge to Court of Appeals not to view it as a Rule 60 (b) appeal and has urged this Court not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.937" offset="13863675">I think it would be inappropriate for this Court to go back and re construe the case if it had been an appeal for denial of Rule 60 (b) relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.033" offset="13896067">Even if it had been though, the result necessarily would have been that the district judge should have been referred just to ample contradictions to support his refusal to modify his earlier order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.707" offset="13942774">The argument that Rule 59 is not applied to Habeas Corpus proceedings overlooks what I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist was getting out in his question as to how do we tell which civil rules apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.376" offset="13993451">We can tell that when it is not explicitly said by looking at former practice and saying if former practice in civil cases confirm to practice in Habeas Corpus cases and indeed it did as we may clear in the two cases that we cite in our brief and at footnote at page 21.</text>
