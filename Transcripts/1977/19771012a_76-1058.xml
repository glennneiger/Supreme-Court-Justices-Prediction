            <text syncTime="45.798" offset="263183">This case unlike the prior case, does not present an income tax question.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.779" offset="287111">It is a withholding tax case, it involves the scope of the withholding tax provisions and primarily the definition of the term wages, an item is not subject to withholding unless it is a wage within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.497" offset="353984">The facts in this case are basically agreed upon the petitioner, a public utility company reimbursed its employees in the year 1963 for expenses which they incurred in traveling on required trips on the company’s business.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.785" offset="439143">The petitioner used the same method of reimbursement, it reimbursed on the same basis for overnight and non-overnight trips.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.345" offset="477387">The Government’s contention is that petitioner should have withheld on the reimbursement payments which were made to employees for mail expenses incurred on non overnight trips and there is no question that withholding is required on any of the other reimbursement payments.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.984" offset="563904">Yes, the District Court held for petitioner, it concluded that the Government’s requirement of withholding on the non-overnight trip, meal reimbursements was a departure from the realities of business life in a vigorous stretching of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.706" offset="646765">The Seventh Circuit reversed and in reversing held in effect that virtually every item arising out of the employment relationship should be included in the withholding base and should be subject to withholding.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.844" offset="3883336">Yes, that they are not synonymous terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.773" offset="3899010">The Government in a number of ruling says found in various situations that an employee may have an income resolved from a payment he receives, but the employer does not have a withholding obligation and the uniformly cited cases up to the Seventh Circuit’s decisions below in the Court of Claims and two Circuit courts have held that the income tax treatment to the employee is immaterial in determining the scope of the withholding tax provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.553" offset="4046131">I think it is also significant that while the Government places considerable emphasis on the this Court’s decision in the Lebot case in 1956 which was a gross income case, it did not consider withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.252" offset="4108930">The rulings which the Government issued saying that just because there was an item of income, does not mean the employer must withhold, came for the most part after that decision was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.362" offset="4169429">So obviously, they were well aware that what the gross income section say, does not influence what the withholding tax provisions are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.327" offset="4217285">The Government does cite a decision of this Court, the Nierotko case in 1946, which does involve withholding and I think it deserves special mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.814" offset="4275173">That case involved the question of whether social security tax withholding was required on an award of back pay to improperly discharged employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.952" offset="4319790">The Court held that it was, but back pay is not the same as remuneration for a travel expense or as a payment of a travel expense reimbursement and as a matter of fact, in the social security regulations, there is a provision such as the one, I have read earlier on travel expense reimbursements it was -- it is identical today, it was substantially the same in 1946, saying that reimbursements are not wages subject to withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.052" offset="4460120">Obviously this Court’s decision on the back pay question that was not intended to overrule that regulation and did not do so, that regulation continues have force in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.041" offset="4532113">The Government has somewhat modified its pure equivalence argument between income and wages by contending that, that the equivalence does not apply if the employee is entitled to an offsetting income tax deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.625" offset="4622497">It is not clear how the Government finds support for this in its withholding provisions, it is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.335" offset="4657292">It is also not clear how the Government thinks this system would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.830" offset="4675264">It suggests that every employee would take on the burden of determining what the income tax deductions of each of its employees is likely to be and not on a payment by payment basis, but it would look on an aggregate basis for the entire year and try to take into account trips which might arise based on unforeseeable events in the company’s business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.242" offset="4796890">It might have to take in all sorts of considerations, but the point is that it would be up to the employer to somehow decide what the income tax deductions would be for each of its many employees and for an employer such as the petitioner with thousands of employees, this is simply an administrative nightmare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.535" offset="4906082">So, basically that the point we want to make is that the Government in arguing the income tax cases has confused the issue here, it is not an income tax case, it is a withholding tax case and the withholding tax provisions must govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.210" offset="4984763">We believe that the withholding tax provisions are quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.886" offset="5003467">The Congress intended that wages be a narrow term and furthermore, the regulations which have been in -- which have been on the books since the very outset of the withholding provisions, preclude the inclusion in the withholding base of reimbursements for legitimate travel expences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.917" offset="5087581">There is a second issue in this case which involves the question of whether the -- a change in the -- an administrative view about the withholding tax provisions can be imposed retroactively against an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.436" offset="5165739">In 1963, when these payments were made, there was not one regulation, or ruling, or court case which would have suggested that these reimbursement payments were subject to the withholding tax and as a matter of fact, the regulation said quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.964" offset="5251839">The Government seems to concede in its brief that if there is a factual or legal basis on which an employer involved, by that withholding was not required, it is then an abuse of discretion to retroactively impose withholding on the employer, and we believe this is clearly this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.698" offset="5358732">It would be an abuse to retroactively impose a withholding requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.521" offset="5378063">The employer after all acts only as an agent for the Government and this does not involve the employer’s tax, it is merely collecting taxes to assist the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.289" offset="6561096">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.670" offset="6570605">I think I would like to begin by referring the Court to the pertinent statutory provision in this case which is set forth at page 1 (a) of the Appendix to our brief, that is the statutory definition of wages in Section 3401 (a) of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.095" offset="6648345">It says that the term wages means all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer, including the cash value or remuneration paid in any medium other than cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.441" offset="6713756">Now, this broad statutory definition of wages, talking about all remuneration is in our view consistent with the Congressional design, in setting up the withholding tax system in 1943 to correct income taxes at their source and thereby prevent what had there to for being the losses of large amounts of revenue for the -- to the Internal Revenue Service and the inconvenience of tax payers having to come up with a large lump sum payment at what was then March 15, and which is now April 15, at the time of the filing of the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.176" offset="6876655">The regulations which we set forth at page 3 (a) of the Appendix, similarly reflect this broad congressional design, because they provide respectively that the name that you call remuneration is immaterial that is salaries, fees, bonuses, commissions and like and it also says that the basis on which the remuneration is paid, that is it could be paid on the basis that a piece where percentage of profits etcetera, all of that is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.986" offset="6995878">The question is, is this remuneration for services by an employee for his employer, now that the petitioner in this case has suggested that what we have done is to mix up the things because this is not an income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.345" offset="7065364">It is a withholding tax case, but necessarily the code has to be read as an integrated haul and we do not suggest that all items of income or wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.266" offset="7100995">We are not suggesting that the gamut of receipts set forth in Section 61 which is set forth at page 1 (a) of the appendix of 15 items which is not an exhaustive list is wages, but we do suggest that the appropriate focus of this case is on Section 61 (a) (1) of that definition, which provides that gross income includes compensation for services including fees, commissions and similar items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.921" offset="7223666">Now, there is no question that seems to us that these lunch payments here, really for the same reasons I have pointed out --</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.077" offset="7248221">But why do you focus on gross income when you have got a specific statutory definition of wages?</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.851" offset="7267343">Well, we focus on gross income Mr. Justice Rehnquist, simply because we think that the statutes dovetail each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.608" offset="7302347">In other words, we are talking about compensation or remuneration for services and we are talking about compensation, those are really the same thing and what they do in our view is to emphasize the purpose of the withholding definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.312" offset="7357204">That is purpose was to collect taxes on what is the employee’s taxable base?</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.111" offset="7388446">In other words, that is why in our view the question of whether these items are -- the relevance of the Correll decision and question whether these items are -- whether some of these items are deductible and the fact that non-overnight lunch payments are not deductible is important because what it demonstrates to us is that the if the withholding tax system is to work coherently, it has to be a rough measure of the employee’s taxable base and in this particular --</text>

            <text syncTime="1921.530" offset="7766072">Well, in any event so we have here in order for the petitioner to prevail here, he has to demonstrate that these payments were not compensatory remuneration for services, and it seems to us that the facts of this case demonstrate the correctness of the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the payments were compensatory remuneration for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.526" offset="7858023">First of all, these are employees, these people who work for the public utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.469" offset="7881847">They were required to perform services, in exchange for the services that they perform, they become eligible for certain agreed upon employee benefits, pursuant to a union contract, much like the union contract in the Kowalski case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.382" offset="7941511">If they worked at a normal duty station they got their wages, no doubt about it that those are subject to withholding and the petitioner does not contend otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.760" offset="7979023">If they went on non-overnight travel, they got their wages plus the $40 a day meal payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.106" offset="8008384">If they did not work for the day, they perform no services, they got no wages and they got no meal payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.979" offset="8035865">It seems to us that there is inescapable cause of connection between the receipt of the meal allowance with $40 per day and the performance of services and in fact, there really is no qualitative difference between the meal allowance and any other element of the employees compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.966" offset="8111829">That is, it is simply comparable to any other kind of economic benefit provided by an employer, in order to better services.</text>
