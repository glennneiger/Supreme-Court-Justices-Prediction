            <text syncTime="17.217" offset="149327">In 1972, the legislature of the State of Alaska adapted a law which gives a residents’ preference to all designated Alaska residents in any job having to do with oil and gas within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.321" offset="217663">The exact mechanism is that the law requires that any person or party, who has a contract with the state in nature of a lease or right away permit or the like to preferentially hire Alaska residents and to first fire the residents of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.512" offset="294463">It is an across the board preference to all Alaska residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.129" offset="312958">The scope or the swath that this cuts is quite broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.587" offset="334796">It applies not only to these contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.033" offset="344514">It applies to their subcontractors and suppliers as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.810" offset="359665">It does not have to take place on state land.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.229" offset="373353">We believe that this is a direct violation of the privileges of the immunities clause of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.870" offset="399893">The Supreme Court of Alaska split 3:2 on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.561" offset="418701">We are asserting before this court the dissents of Justices Bucci and Rabinovitz, and the Alaska Supreme Court which we feel articulates exactly our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.513" offset="458512">There is also a 14th Amendment claim presented as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.569" offset="486724">The use of the word “residents” in context of Alaska Hire means domiciliary.</text>

            <text syncTime="121.304" offset="565614">The preference is given to all residents, who are defined under the statute as domiciliary.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.394" offset="594035">The purported legislative reasons or justification for what is called “Alaska Hire” is chronic unemployment within the State of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.106" offset="632801">The Supreme Court of Alaska, it is our position I believe that appellees disagree, recognized that this was a transparency and that in fact, this was simply a broad‑based economic preference given to all Alaska residents in preference to the residents of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.232" offset="701346">Additionally, Alaska Hire itself supports that position adapted by the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.499" offset="794447">Alaska does have a case State v. Lilly decided dealing with governmental employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.991" offset="820360">My personal belief is that I do not feel that it is proper to discriminate against the residents of other states even in state employment as well or public contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.639" offset="862992">I realized that McCarthy versus Philadelphia Commission might indicate otherwise, but that issue, Mr. Justice Blackmun, is not really relevant to this case because we are talking about private employment here, not governmental employment or not public contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="801.493" offset="3286424">McCready is highly distinguishable and it has been severely limited by the Toomer case, in which this court refused to expand it any further than it already was, which was very narrow and relates of course to the planning of oysters and the tidal waters of the Ware River and Virginia, and deals with access or planting of oysters to state property.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.160" offset="3369075">It has nothing to do with resulting employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.550" offset="3386630">Of course, in Alaska, the oil and gas is in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.326" offset="3401676">We believe it falls directly under the Foster-Fountain v.

            <text syncTime="876.170" offset="3585056">It is talking about common property that is property that is owned jointly by all the people of the state which Fish and Game had historically been thought to be, which is different and distinguishable than property ownership in chief or in general.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.875" offset="3719952">The conservation argument was made in Toomer versus Witsell as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.814" offset="3739701">McCready, as was recognized by the court in Toomer, is the only case that has ever been decided by this court, in which there are no persuasive independent reasons for the discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.292" offset="12105572">With respect to the suspect classification argument we have pointed out that this court has never held that non-residency falls into that suspect classification category.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.415" offset="12642127">The other right is protected by the privileges and immunities clause, Article 4 Section 2.With that, I will close.</text>

            <text syncTime="3154.062" offset="12696670">There is a disagreement among the parties over what the Alaska Supreme Court has ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.287" offset="12721539">However, it is our position, as I have attempted to amplify to the court in the reply brief that the Alaska Court rejected the legislative findings as being any sort of justification or any sort of basis for Alaska Hire and rather found that it is simply an across the boards economic preference given to Alaska residents that the state has the right to do because it owns the resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.924" offset="12828119">The independent reasons asserted, the independent reasons being high-end employment, were rejected by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.707" offset="12855286">But, even if they are considered, they do not in and of themselves justify discrimination against residents of other states just because of unique problems, if they exist at all, in Alaska because as I have tried to argue with every state at least in its own eyes, has its own unique problems and unique attributes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.794" offset="13015573">I personally, again, see no justification for a residency requirement for admission to the Bar because you do not have to remain a resident once you are admitted to practice law, at least in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.390" offset="13070012">The theory, as I understand it, is that it gives the State Board of Bar Examiners an opportunity to examine the person’s qualification, if they are actually there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.029" offset="13108569">I think a domiciliary requirement does not meet that particular need.</text>
