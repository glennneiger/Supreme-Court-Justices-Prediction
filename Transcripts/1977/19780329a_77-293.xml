            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79991">We will hear arguments next in Kulko against the Superior Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.818" offset="347171">Mr. Stotter, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_h_stotter" startTime="72.040" stopTime="279.202">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence H. Stotter</label>
            <text syncTime="72.040" offset="368069">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.326" offset="385206">This case arises in an action for child support in the State of California as a consequence of the departure of two children from the custody of their father in the home that they had enjoyed all of their lives in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.340" offset="461274">The matter comes before you as a final judgment of the Supreme Court of California under California rules which permit us to bifurcate issues of jurisdiction and challenge those up through the courts, which is done by a writ of mandate and was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.293" offset="537134">We submit that this Court has jurisdiction by virtue of the nature of the California statute which is involved in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.434" offset="585722">In particular this particular statute states a court of this state may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of this state and/or of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.616" offset="650401">In the legislative judicial council comments, the legislature adapted the statement that the sufficiency of such context is a matter of constitutional law on which the Supreme Court of the United States has the final voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.024" offset="724066">So as a consequence in this particular action before you, there is almost a co-existence between the construction of the statute and its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.476" offset="777878">I might submit to the Court that I think there is a question with respect to the omnibus type of statute in terms of it being an improper delegation of the legislative duty to the courts or possibly even vagueness, but that has not been the approach raised by the appellant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.435" offset="869725">The approach in this particular case is how the statute is applied as being unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.737" offset="902848">We also submit that the issue of mootness raised by the appellee is not appropriate in this case because in fact, in each case at each level this was raised solely on special appearance to challenge the jurisdiction of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.671" offset="978603">The Trial Court so found at each level that this was an issue of special appearance even after the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.540" offset="1022071">The Trial Court found that we had appeared only by special appearance and I might add that in the Titus case cited by us, the specific Act of advising the court after it had already denied a motion to quash that the matter was going up on appeal and did not have jurisdiction was found by the Appellate Court to not constitute an appearance at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.541" offset="1142130">Lastly, Your Honors, we submit that the issue of mootness is inappropriate in a situation or in a society in which there has generally been an attitude of expanding jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence H. Stotter</label>
            <text syncTime="387.661" offset="1630620">I think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.376" offset="1637411">Now, in this particular case, the Appellant, Ezra Kulko differs materially from the type of parties which have generally been before this Court, in state court jurisdiction cases relating the non-residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.774" offset="1703031">We have here an average citizen family man engaged in common family interactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.968" offset="1743782">He is not a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.750" offset="1750887">He is not involved in doing business or acts for economic benefits such as generally all of the cases that in the past have been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.726" offset="1802819">This is the type of individual that strikes all across the breadth of this country’s activities, from the penthouse to the ghetto there are people engaging in the split of their family and entering into marital settlement agreements of the type engaged in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.990" offset="1879932">I submit that the activities of this particular party or both of these parties are acts that are going on by thousands of citizens across the country monthly, if not weekly.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.021" offset="1932073">Second, Dr. Kolko in this case is both a resident and a domiciliary of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.195" offset="1964673">He was born, educated, married, established his home there and for all intents and purposes with a few exceptions, has never left the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.052" offset="2000095">He is not the typical father who has departed from the domicile state in order to escape his obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.992" offset="2031860">He has remained in the state of the marital domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.744" offset="2050878">In this particular case, on the contrary, it is the appellee, the wife who has departed from the domicile state and who has obtained an essence to use what some of the commentators talk about as the migratory or suitcase divorce with the consent of the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.754" offset="2134992">In addition, it should be borne in mind that each of the two children at 2-year-intervals also departed from the State of New York and from the residence of the father by their own choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.697" offset="2198731">Now in addition, we have here a recognition that at the time of the filing of Mrs. Horn’s complaint the father was the legal custodian of both of these two children by virtue of a marital settlement agreement which if Your Honors please was negotiated, prepared, executed and carried out in the State of New York by Mrs. Horn’s attorney, Dr. Horn not being represented by choice and which Mrs. Horn flew from California to New York in order to execute and complete the negotiations at that particular time.</text>

            <text syncTime="595.006" offset="2459955">I think the facts, Mr. Chief Justice, of New York domicile is important in this case, but not for the traditional reasons that there was a decree entered in New York, but simply because the facts and circumstances relating to the parties and their agreement as negotiated in New York gives a great deal of importance to the ties that New York would give to its contracts and certainly to its negotiated marital settlement agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.262" offset="2589000">It is significant, I submit, that it was Mrs. Kulko who departed from New York to obtain the decree and subsequently was married in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.508" offset="2641976">Under circumstances, which based upon her residence in California, she could have at the time obtained the typical type of no fault divorce or dissolution allowed by California, but she chose instead to come east and go through the arrangements at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.068" offset="2716164">So she had the option at that time of getting jurisdiction in the State of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="3794.599" offset="15258283">Briefly, the California Supreme Court specifically found that there was no knowledge by the father of Darwin’s departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.574" offset="15294228">Number two, I submit to the Court that in the Appendix to the brief, the Court specifically finds that only a special appearance was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3825.149" offset="15380536">The Green brief, the Court specifically finds only a special appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.670" offset="15398613">In the Appendix in my motion to writ of mandate rather at page 38 is specifically set forth the challenges to the constitution of the particular code section in question and I sight Pennoyer v. Neff, International Shoe, the Titus, etcetera in response to earlier questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.562" offset="15486175">In conclusion, let me submit that in the search for fair play and substantial justice in all the cases that cite when we go back to McDonald v. Maybe (Ph), Justice Holmes indicated “in states bound together by a constitution and subject to the Fourteenth Amendment, great caution should be used not to let fiction deny the fair play that can be secured only by pretty close adhesion to the fact.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.358" offset="15601323">Under circumstances where this Court has already found mechanical and quantitative evaluations, it should not be a determination to say that buying one airplane ticket is sufficient to make this type of connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.264" offset="15660987">It seems to me as going the other way from what this Court has previously said.</text>
