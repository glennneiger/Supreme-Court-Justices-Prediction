            <text syncTime="50.589" offset="282739">This court has granted the petition of Commonwealth of Massachusetts to issue a writ of certiorari to the United States, Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.955" offset="312205">The basic issue raised on review concerns the constitutionality of applying the Federal Excise Tax on the use of civil Aircraft to a state police helicopter owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and use exclusively for public safety purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.332" offset="373750">The action was initiated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States, District Court of the District of Massachusetts on a petition to refund of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.666" offset="411053">The tax computed is computed by $25 flat fee plus a varying amount based on the weight of the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.329" offset="441668">The tax was $131.43 for the taxable year ended June 30th 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.596" offset="466746">The total collected by a levy on funds of a Commonwealth was $183.38.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.677" offset="607076">Other aircraft owned by the Massachusetts Aeronautics Commission and there are tax bills in abance of a much larger figure than the $180.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.817" offset="647618">Talking about strictly for this year 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.894" offset="664023">Commonwealth alleged that the helicopter was used by the State Police only for public safety purposes such as promoting highway safety and conducting searches for suspected criminals or escapees from correctional facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.449" offset="714178">The United States moved to dismiss the complaint, prepared a state acclaimed on which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.899" offset="736016">The District court allowed the motion stating that the decisions of this court talking about state immunity from federal taxation were essentially of historical interest only.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.439" offset="778125">And the court also stated that this is a classic case of a user fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.854" offset="795784">That rationale was based on the fact that the revenue derived from these aircraft taxes is used to make grants to state-owned airports or airport expansion and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.836" offset="847716">On appeal the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court but only discussed the user fee rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.361" offset="877809">That rationale was based largely on an analogy, the team concerning cases of this court which upheld forfeit fees by municipalities as not in violation of the constitutional prohibition against duties on tonnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.562" offset="942592">Commonwealth petitioned this court to certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.656" offset="955027">The Solicitor General agreed that the case should be resolved because there was a decision by a federal court in Georgia which has sustained the immunity of Georgia from this particular tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.624" offset="998912">The essential position of the Commonwealth, that this particular tax violates the constitutional principle of intergovernmental tax immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.836" offset="1031722">The basic defense of the United States is that this tax is also a users fee and therefore exempt from the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.007" offset="1060457">The Commonwealth view the argument will be broken down in to three basic parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.086" offset="1080728">First of all that there is no exception to the principle of intergovernmental tax immunity for taxes which are also designated, user fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.827" offset="1115732">Second, that even if we discuss the user fee rationale, the taxing question even fails on those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.107" offset="1144780">Third, I would briefly discuss the implications of the case of National League of Cities v. Usery, concerning the position of the Commonwealth here.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.203" offset="1181247">Did the Court of Appeals ever address itself to the question of whether the general language of the statute meant that the tax should be applicable to state-owned vehicles.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.195" offset="1353133">There is also Legislative History, Your Honor, which explains why the exemption from the passage of tax, that used to exist for government employees, that's no longer in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.910" offset="1392003">And the Legislative History states that they think all aircrafts should pay their way for the use of the aircraft system.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.735" offset="1415304">So that issue was never really raised and we do not contest the applicability of the tax as matter of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.135" offset="1452920">The tax is clearly a tax irrespective of whether or not we also describe it as a users fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.098" offset="1480819">As such it clearly comes within the scope of the principle as historically stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.056" offset="1500568">First of all, there is a direct imposition on the funds of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.584" offset="1518749">Second of all even though the amount of the tax is not excessive in its direct terms, it's only $131 for this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.051" offset="1552604">In all decisions concerning the principle of tax immunity whether it's federal immunity or state immunity the court has always stated that the amount is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.324" offset="1585727">The basic issue is whether or not there is a an infringement of sovereignty not whether or not the tax in question is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.183" offset="1617178">It also is --</text>

            <text syncTime="385.305" offset="1621567">Now, Mr. O'Malley what if 120- 130 years ago, whenever it was a crucial, national issue, the federal government had build a toll road over the Appalachians and it charged everybody who was pulling a wagon over that toll road, whatever say a dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.914" offset="1704009">Do you think a state could have claimed immunity from that sort of a charge?</text>

            <text syncTime="433.199" offset="1813201">Yes Your Honor, the crux of the issue is that there is a direct imposition on the Commonwealth's funds for the general support of government rather than the individual act of a proprietor trying to get compensation for the use of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.918" offset="2740026">A legislature repealed the exemption for the employees and I think the tax here is quite different because at least it's user oriented in that case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.617" offset="2798854">There are a number of exceptions that are recognized in the immunity principle, so that there is no question about the federal power raised revenue being unduly interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.263" offset="2837410">In other words, the states have to be engaging in the sovereign function and they cannot immunize contract as all of the employees from incidental federal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.459" offset="2874191">These type of considerations have often been recognized but the fact is that no other exception has ever been recognized for taxes such as this, where the government claims, they have a particular use if they want to make for this particular revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.821" offset="2931660">The sole argument that the government seems to make is that this court should analagyse this tax with taxes that are enacted from interstate carriers or even state highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.568" offset="2978680">We consider the questions involved in an undue burden of interstate commerce issue quite different from the sovereignty issues raised in the tax immunity argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.218" offset="3013267">The interstate commerce burden question necessarily involves a question of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.146" offset="3036986">The relative judgments have to be made but in terms of the constitutional principle involving the status of the states under the constitution, questions of degree do not illuminate whether or not there is actually an infringement in the constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.269" offset="3105427">But even when reference is made to the user fee argument, there are two aspect that the Commonwealth wishes to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.414" offset="3138027">First of all, this case was decided on a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.490" offset="3154328">In the first instance, whether or not there has been an approximate benefit relative to the amount of the tax would raise the factual question which probably would have to require a hearing but more importantly, we think the failure of the user fee to even qualify as such in this case indicates that this type of innovation is unworthy in the tax immunity area because even though different difficult factual issues will be raised, they do not illuminate the questions of sovereignty that are involved here that are not involved in cases where you have an interstate carrier claiming that their activities are being unduly burdened.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.040" offset="3584512">No, Your Honor, I think it is more analogous to the cases where the salaries of government employees that once considered immune from federal taxation but that particular aspect of the doctrine is since been discarded because -- just because the state has to perhaps make up the difference in order to supply a wage and cover that tax, the connection between the state and the imposition of the taxes was more remote and do not justify the protection that they thought the constitution required.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.218" offset="3709273">The formula in this case only involved weight, there was no formula which speaks of the amount of the use of the system concerning the amount of a tax, but even when you get beyond the formula and you look to the result, the user fee is not proved to be a rough accommodation, approximation of the amount of use of a system.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.946" offset="3796209">The Secretary of Transportation was required by Congress in this Act to make a cost allocation study concerning whether or not these charges were actually geared to in any way, the use of a system.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.976" offset="3844274">The secretary's findings are clear that the amount of the tax is not related to the use of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.514" offset="3874471">Now, this is a report filed by the federal official chart with the regulation of the airways and it should be given considerable weight by this court and should also be an indication that getting into this type of problem in the sovereignty area is not a productive one because it in no way illuminates what we consider to be the basic question of power rather than the question of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.530" offset="3970498">Finally, the United States really does not address the failure of this particular tax to work out as a rough approximation of the use of a system.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.429" offset="4006129">Rather it makes a comparison that the Commonwealth in this particular year involved did receive $1.5 million in grants for airport expansion and development and then compute it with the amount of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.073" offset="4052731">We think this is clearly indicative of why it would not be appropriate to use the user fee issue in the tax immunity area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.574" offset="4086690">First of all, the amount awarded was pursuant to a Matching Grant Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.135" offset="4108947">These are the type of programs that are often used in Federal state areas such as welfare and education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.657" offset="4130994">They have programs of co-operative federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.246" offset="4141338">The United States states does not mention, first of all, they don't mention that this is a Matching Grant Program and second of all they do not mention the amount that the Commonwealth supplied in programs of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.685" offset="4183134">If necessary, the Commonwealth would prove that the Commonwealth supplied $346,000 to meet the grants made by the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.247" offset="4221378">Now, if this figure are degree of matching grant is not satisfactory, then Congress would be free to change the formulas so that the state had to supply more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.184" offset="4269129">But at least it would be done on a voluntary cooperative federal state basis and it would not require the unilateral and potentially cohesive measure such as the tax and measuring question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.475" offset="4322315">And finally in the cases involving the use of the highways and their requirement to pay their way in interstate commerce, the court has always been satisfied that the highways were provided by the states and the states were really just demanding compensation for the use of the highways, and if the state was really in a proprietary capacity for the most part in making the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.321" offset="4417714">In this case the tax is on the use of the navigable airspace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.270" offset="4433492">The federal government does not own the airspace and even when reference is made to the airport facilities, there are still state based facilities that is either owned by the state or the political subdivisions and in some cases these facilities may or may not receive federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.181" offset="4509143">This indicates how we have difficulty in approximating the amount of use with the amount of a tax, the difficulty also added in this case is that we are not even sure what the use of what facility is being compensated for, by levying a tax on the use of a navigable air space.</text>

            <text syncTime="1436.853" offset="5827804">In 1970, Congress enacted a law entitled an Act to provide for an expansion and improvement of the nation's airport and airways system and for the imposition of the airport and airway user charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.417" offset="5882034">This Act was divided into two titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.949" offset="5892169">Title 1, the Airport and Airway Development Act authorized the Secretary of Transportation, to spend a great deal of money to improve the nation's airports and the services which make air travel safe, services such as air traffic control, communication and navigation aids.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.775" offset="5959461">Title 2, the Airport and Airway Revenue Act imposed or increased charges on those who use the nation's airports and such supporting services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.028" offset="5996555">One of those charges is that a issue here, a charge or tax on the use of any taxable civil aircraft of $25 per year or plus a few cents propound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.690" offset="6039187">Title 2 also established a Trust Fund to ensure that the funds raised by the charges in Title 2 would help pay for the improvements required by Title 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.085" offset="6080774">The issue in this case is whether the Commonwealth of Massachusetts which uses the services made possible by Title 1, every time its helicopter lifts off the pad must pay its share of the cost imposed by Title 2.</text>
