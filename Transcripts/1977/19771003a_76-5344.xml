            <label>Mr. Patrick J. Hughes, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="20.366" offset="161377">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.243" offset="184887">The petitioner here is challenging the validity of his Illinois rape conviction, a conviction based on the witness identification testimony of the one and only eyewitness to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.009" offset="239953">The victim is a white woman who was sleeping in a darkened room when she was awaken by a noise.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.793" offset="267120">She then had at most a 10-15 second opportunity to observe the face and the figure of her masked, black assailant, I am sorry, unmasked, black assailant, subsequently he was masked during the course of the commission of the -- of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.067" offset="328247">A conviction for which the petitioner is presently serving a 50 -- 30 to 50 years sentence of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.799" offset="355101">The crime occurred on December 14th, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.078" offset="376208">In the week after the crime occurred, this witness had two opportunities to view various photographs, but made no identification of anyone from those photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.776" offset="423019">Seven days after the assault, without any showing of existent circumstances, without any showing of necessity, the police brought this sole eyewitness to a courtroom where the petitioner was scheduled to appear, charged with the crime that was committed upon her.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.680" offset="498670">The witness was brought to that courtroom specifically for the purpose of making an identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.497" offset="521866">That identification proceeding was to be her first opportunity to view any person since the date of the -- of the crime, since the time of the assault, she had viewed no suspect prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.305" offset="569096">When she arrived at that courtroom over her objection and before she viewed the suspect, she was asked to sign the formal charge that are already been placed against the petitioner in that Courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.517" offset="617997">She was then placed in that courtroom to wait and while she was waiting there she saw other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.412" offset="641612">In the course of seeing those cases as the defendants’ name in those cases was called, the defendants were brought out from the lockup, the defendants in custody were brought out from the lockup and she observed that happening for some period of time before the petitioner’s case was called.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.967" offset="703783">The petitioner’s name was then called, a name she recognized because she had seen it on the complaint that the police had asked her to sign a few minutes time earlier, a complaint she did not want to sign without making an identification, but which nonetheless at the urging she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.565" offset="770239">The petitioner was then brought out from the lockup and stood before the bench, before the Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.566" offset="794167">The complainant, the sole eyewitness was then asked by the clerk, her name was called by the clerk and she was asked to come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.013" offset="823946">She was brought up to stay and seven or eight feet from the place where the defendant, petitioner was standing in front of that same judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.985" offset="859891">At the time that the petitioner stood there, not only was he an indigent without counsel, but in violation of an Illinois statute which specifically required that the judge advise him of his right to have counsel, he was not so advised.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.337" offset="1009311">The entire proceeding is -- is found at pages 48 and 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.390" offset="1045465">The witness then -- this sole eyewitness then heard the prosecutor to tell the judge that certain items taken from her home at the time of the assault, at the time the crime had committed upon -- -- had been committed upon her, were recovered from the petitioner’s apartment when he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.113" offset="1116413">That statement was wholly untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.008" offset="1131982">The prosecutor’s next statement was that the clothing of her assailant was recovered from the petitioner’s apartment when he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.687" offset="1166673">None of that clothing was ever introduced in evidence in course of the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.360" offset="1189347">These statements were then immediately followed by the prosecutor asking the witness to identify the petitioner as her assailant which she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.390" offset="1233442">The critical nature of this proceeding in this case, the identification procedure in this case is emphasized by what we believe just the lack of other reliable evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.589" offset="1274297">For example, at the time subsequent to the assault, the complainant victim advised the police to look on a file box that was in the apartment for fingerprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.881" offset="1319437">They did in fact find a fingerprint.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.086" offset="1328319">They compared that fingerprint with that of the petitioner and it was not his.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.338" offset="1349321">The clothing, certain clothing taken from him at the time of his arrest and that -- that clothing included a pair of trousers.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.708" offset="1382758">The fly area as well as the rest of that area was tested by a Chicago Police Department lab technician and that technician testified that he found no semen, no female cells, no matching hairs or fibers and no blood in the trousers, even though at the time of the assault, an examination by doctor a few hours later disclosed that she was menstruating.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.279" offset="1492995">Our major contentions are; first, that this indigent petitioner had an absolute right to counsel at that initial court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.186" offset="1524655">At least the state we believe concedes in its brief that she had a right to counsel of that proceeding.</text>
