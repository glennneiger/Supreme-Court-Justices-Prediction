            <text syncTime="16.920" offset="147598">The Trans Alaska Pipeline Rates cases which I hear from the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.823" offset="187200">When the Trans Alaska Pipeline was completed, seven of its eight oil company owners filed their tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission setting out initial rates and the rules to govern transportation of oil over from Prudhoe Bay and Alaskan Arctic to the all-weather port of Valdez on Alaska's Pacific coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.536" offset="294093">The rates were met immediately by several formal protests that there were excessive and the Interstate Commerce Commission, acting under Section 15 (7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, suspended the rates for the full seven months allowed by that Section because the Commission found that it would be in the public interest, if the system closed for seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.229" offset="392835">The Commission estimated rates that approximated what its judgment full investigation would likely reveal to be lawful rates and stated that it would not suspend interim rates that specified rates no higher than those estimated.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.674" offset="458664">However, since the estimated rates might still "exceed reasonable levels," the Commission also stated that any interim tariffs must provide for refunds of any amounts found later to be in excess of lawful rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.553" offset="526164">And on petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sustained the Commission action and rejected as without merit, three arguments made by the petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.486" offset="589903">First, that the Commission had no statutory authority under Section 15 (7) to suspend initial rates, but authority only to suspend changes in existing tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.587" offset="642253">Second, that the Commission had no statutory authority ancillary to the suspension power to set out without an adjudicatory hearing maximum interim rates which it would allow to go into effect during the suspension period and third and finally that the Commission had no authority to condition a decision not to suspend tariffs on a requirement that the carriers, tariffs were allowed to go into effect be prepared to make refunds of any amounts collected whether under initially proposed or interim tariffs which were later determined after full hearing to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.804" offset="791151">We in agreement with the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, also find no merit in these arguments of petitioners and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.003" offset="839947">Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the consideration of decision of these cases.</text>
