            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.652" offset="118553">The respondents in this case are home owners in Memphis, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.525" offset="138092">They are utility customers for gas and electric service of the Gas, Light and Water division of the City of Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.985" offset="171843">The dispute arose with respect to of what respondents thought was double billing and during the relevant period, respondent's utility service was terminated on five occasions, allegedly for non-payment of bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.473" offset="233805">Respondents were not explicitly advised as to how and before whom the dispute could resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.784" offset="263062">Respondents brought this action against the City's utility division and several of its officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.321" offset="289185">They claimed that service has been terminated without affording them the fair opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.699" offset="318755">Injunctive and damage relief were sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.806" offset="331189">Under Tennessee law the right to continued utility service so long as proper bills were paid is a protected interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.173" offset="372672">Thus respondents could not lawfully be deprived of this interest without notice and a fair opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.640" offset="402556">Although the District Court rejected respondent's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.575" offset="422200">The Court of Appeals held that petitioner's procedure with respect to the termination of service did not comport with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.037" offset="468071">In the Appellate Court view the constitutional guarantee requires that a publicly owned utility provide due notice of the proposed termination and an established procedure of resolution of disputed bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.976" offset="531810">Termination of utility service can effect health and even life itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.953" offset="555738">For the reasons stated more fully in the opinion filed today with a clerk, we agree with petitioners, we agree that that petitioner's dispute resolution procedure, failed to afford respondents a fair opportunity for the informal resolution of disputed bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.915" offset="631598">Accordingly we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.695" offset="646749">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist join.</text>
