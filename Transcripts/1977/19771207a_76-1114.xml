            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="91.455" offset="445816">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.823" offset="463266">This cases involve oil and gas leases and the extent of the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, formerly the Federal Power Commission under section 7D of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.226" offset="524810">Section 7D as set out on the Appendix to our brief provides, and I would like to read it in full since I think it is crucial to this case:“No natural gas company shall abandon oil or any portion of its facilities, subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission or any service rendered by means of such facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.827" offset="611223">without the permission and approval of the Commission first had and obtained after due hearing, and the finding by the Commission that the available supply of natural gas is depleted to the extent that the continuance of service is unwarranted or that the present and future public convenience or necessity permits such abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.215" offset="684784">”In these cases, a gas producer had leased gas producing property under a 50-year lease and had sold gas from that property in interstate commerce, pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the commission without limit of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.725" offset="754897">The question presented in the case is whether, when the 50-year term of the lease expires, the process of supplying gas from that property to interstate commerce may be terminated and the gas produced from those reserves sold in intrastate commerce instead without a requirement that either the lessee or the lessor obtain abandonment authorization from the Commission pursuant to section 7D of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.320" offset="877254">The facts may be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.851" offset="891360">In 1925, Gulf Oil Corporation obtained an Oil and Gas lease from the owners of the Waddell Ranch in Crane County in West Texas, part of the Permian Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.923" offset="943605">The lease gave Gulf the exclusive right to explore for oil and gas on the Waddell Ranch and to produce and market all the oil and gas it might find there for the fixed term of 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.331" offset="993238">The lease provided that the owners of the Waddell Ranch, the lessors would receive a royalty from Gulf based on the quantity of natural gas produced and the number of producing wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.954" offset="1043811">A year later in 1926, the owners of the Waddell Ranch conveyed one half of their mineral fee interest to Southland Royalty Company, one of respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.237" offset="1092921">Other shares in the mineral interest under the Waddell Ranch were subsequently conveyed to a number of other owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.127" offset="1124477">At present, the record discloses that Southland owns 47 percent, trustees under the will of Warren right own 26 percent, the Exxon Corporation owns 14 percent and there are more than one hundred other owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.734" offset="1198874">I will refer at times to all those owners collectively as Southland.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.777" offset="1227086">In 1951, Gulf entered into a contract with El Paso Natural Gas Company and Interstate Pipeline, whereby Gulf agreed to sell to El Paso surplus residue gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.648" offset="1282570">That is a portion of the casing head gas which comes from oil wells as distinguished from gas well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.676" offset="1318619">Gulf agreed to sell to El Paso’s surplus residue gas from the Waddell lease and from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.129" offset="1344428">In 1954, after this Court’s decision in the Phillips case, Gulf applied to the Federal Power Commission, as it then was, for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity, under section 7E of the Natural Gas Act, authorizing it to make the sale to El Paso and this certificate was granted by the Commission in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.635" offset="1430528">Either the application for the certificate nor the certificate itself provided for any limit of time on the sales or service being authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.899" offset="1471592">In 1972, Gulf entered into a second similar contract with El Paso for the sale of gas coming from the Waddell lease and other sources.Gulf again applied for a certificate to the Federal Power Commission and again got it in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.223" offset="1544839">On July 14, 1975, the 50-year term of the Waddell lease came to an end and the lease expired and title to the mineral estate in the Waddell Ranch thus, reverted to the reversionary mineral interest owners - Southland, et all.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.672" offset="1630626">Meanwhile, there is also, in this case the Goldsmith lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.859" offset="1647344">Also in 1925, Gulf entered into a similar 50-year fixed term oil and gas lease with Goldsmith and others on the Goldsmith Ranch in Ector County, Texas, also West Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.814" offset="1711187">The owners of the Goldsmith Ranch subsequently conveyed their mineral interest to others including the same Southland Royalty Company, and including Texaco Inc. which now owns one-fourth of the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.386" offset="1761447">Gulf sold gas from the Goldsmith lease to Phillips Petroleum Company which processed that gas and sold it to El Paso for resale in interstate commerce, pursuant to certificates that the Commission granted to El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.966" offset="1819857">In 1975, of course, the Goldsmith lease also expired and title to the mineral estate reverted to the reversionary mineral interest owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.918" offset="1859667">For the purposes of this case, the parties had agreed that the Waddell lease and the Goldsmith lease, the Waddell Ranch and the Goldsmith Ranch, and all the legal ramifications of each have no legal differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.704" offset="1922779">And thus, I will adapt the practice followed by Southland in its brief and refer at least sometimes to both leases and terms of the Waddell lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.901" offset="1971576">I will always refer to the lessee as Gulf, although in fact there are some other minor lessees, and I will sometimes refer to the owners of the reversionary mineral interests simply as Southland.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.943" offset="2027687">Now, the proceedings before the Commission…</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="488.934" stopTime="501.593">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="488.934" offset="2035733">Mr. Barnett, right at that point when you are clarifying the parties, is it Gulf or the Southland and Waddell people that within your view of Section 7B is the natural gas company within the meaning of the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_barnett" startTime="501.593" stopTime="704.722">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="501.593" offset="2086306">I plan to get to that, Mr. Justice Stevens, but in short I think they both are but I will expound on that a little more fully in a moment, if you like.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.558" offset="2130191">The proceedings before the Commission were as follows: Shortly before the end of the Waddell lease period in 1975, Southland entered into a contract with Intratex Gas Company and Intrastate gas pipeline in Texas, whereby Southland agreed to sell to Intratex on the unregulated intrastate market gas from the Waddell lease after the lease expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.084" offset="2240324">Needless to say, the intrastate price - and that is what this case is all about of course - the intrastate price is significantly higher than the interstate price regulated by the Commission, at which the gas was being sold to El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.792" offset="2303122">In January 1975, having heard that Southland was soliciting proposals for intrastate sales of its gas, El Paso petitioned the Commission for a declaratory judgment, as to whether when the Waddell lease expired, Southland and the other reversionary mineral interest owners would be entitled to terminate the deliveries of Waddell Ranch Gas to El Paso and sell the gas instead on the intrastate market without getting the Commission’s approval under Section 7B.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.606" offset="2446377">Texaco as one-fourth owner of the reversionary estate in the Goldsmith Ranch filed a similar petition for a declaratory judgment before the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.428" offset="2485666">Since the cases were so similar, the Commission consolidated the two proceedings since there were no issues or fact, no evidentiary hearings were sought or held various parties intervened before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.815" offset="2539164">The Commission issued its decision in July 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.822" offset="2555256">It held that the various mineral interest reversioners may not sell gas from the reserves underlying the Waddell and Goldsmith Ranches in intrastate commerce without first obtaining abandonment authorization from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.279" offset="2617009">Because the Commission held that gas had been dedicated to interstate commerce by the certificate of sales that the lessees had made to El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.346" offset="2657342">The Commission reasoned that under the decisions of this Court, the dedication involved is not the dedication of an individual party or producer but the dedication of gas and that once the service of supplying gas in interstate commerce from specific acreage has commenced, quoting this Court’s decisions in CATCO and Sunray “There can be no withdrawal of that supply from continued interstate movement without Commission approval.”</text>
            <text syncTime="673.258" offset="2773013">The Commission said, “This does not mean that we are modifying the law of Texas as to the leasehold rights; we are however recognizing rights and duties that have been created by the Congress under the Natural Gas Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="686.377" offset="2825466">The Commission therefore held - and this relates to your question, Mr. Justice Stevens - that the reversionary mineral interest owners and also Gulf were required to obtain abandonment authority under Section 7 before ceasing the interstate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.008" offset="2883981">I do not mean to say that answers your question;I propose to try to do so in a minute.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="704.722" offset="2898818">It was not at any agency theory then, it was just the idea that if the lessee had dedicated it, it was automatically dedicated when the lease reverted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_barnett" startTime="714.556" stopTime="862.159">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="714.556" offset="2938211">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.559" offset="2942181">The Commission’s theory was that it is a dedication of gas, not a dedication of any particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.842" offset="2971334">As it has otherwise been put, it is an in rem rather than in personam concept, the gas is dedicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.220" offset="3000800">I will return to some of the ramifications of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.726" offset="3014802">On petition for rehearing the Commission essentially adhered, the Commission did adhere to its findings and conclusions, although adding some supplementary reasoning that I think I need not recite.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.312" offset="3061195">Southland and the other reversionary interest owners appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the Commission’s orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.940" offset="3091706">The court viewed the issue of interstate dedication as controlled by local Texas law, noting that, “under applicable Texas law, Gulf’s rights were those of a tenant for a term of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.348" offset="3149385">Its interest was a limited one which terminated completely when title reverted to Southland at the expiration of the 50-year term”.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.661" offset="3182613">Thus, “under well-established concepts of property law, Gulf could not legally deal in, or dedicate that portion of the gas which Southland might own upon termination of Gulf’s estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.714" offset="3230782">The Court reiterated that under Texas law, Gulf’s 50-year lease interest did not authorize it to impose any limitation on the reversionary estate, and that under Texas property law, Gulf could not bind the reversionary estate by its actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.243" offset="3292954">The Court thus concluded that by virtue of local law, the reversioners were free to cease the service to El Paso and its interstate customers and to sell the gas from these reserves in intrastate commerce after expiration of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.152" offset="3380516">Petitions for certiorari were filed in this Court by the Commission and also by El Paso in the State of California, the Court granted the petitions and consolidated the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.257" offset="3432970">Well, in the first place, we submit that the case is controlled by the plain language of Section 7B.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.263" offset="3465048">That language provides, “No natural gas company shall abandon all or any portion of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any service rendered by means of such facilities without first obtaining abandonment authorization from the Commission.”</text>

            <text syncTime="903.863" offset="3695448">I do not take it, I think it could not be denied, and it is not denied that Gulf was performing a service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission by the sales it was making to El Paso under the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.722" offset="3750828">Given that service, and the Court has emphasized in the Sunray case, the importance of the service concept under Section 7B.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.846" offset="3791370">The Court there said that it is a service, not just a sale that the Commission authorizes when it grants a certificate under Section 7E.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.550" offset="3830136">In the language, quoted in our brief at page 11, “It is evident that all that matters for which a certificate is required must be justified in terms of a service to which they relate.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.466" offset="4117796">However, it might be argued and our opponents apparently do argue that you also have to have a natural gas company on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.242" offset="4152905">That 7B says, “No natural gas company shall abandon” and Southland at least argues that it is not a natural gas company for the purposes of this case and, thus, I come to the question you raised earlier and I think there are several answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.904" offset="4219569">One is that Gulf is a natural gas company, clearly for the purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.887" offset="4243497">The Commission in its certificate granted to Gulf for the sales specifically held that the applicant is a natural gas company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.259" offset="4652993">In our opinion, this is not a mere technical requirement, but would allow us to pacify on the merits of the lessee’s abandonments upon the termination of the 50-year leases, as well as the proposed abandonment of the reversioners.</text>

            <label>Mr. Randolph W. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="2087.920" offset="8431657">My argument is that first of all, this gas goes to all the States on the El Paso system but more importantly, the theory of the case could be applied not only to these two fixed term leases but to all types of leases including life of production leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.460" offset="8529773">Therefore, that the facts or the theory of the case could be applied to cause a loss of a great deal more gas from the interstate system and this is in opposite to one of the basic protections of the consumer in the United States unto the Natural Gas Act, which is to have an assurance of inadequate and reliable supply of gas in interstate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.215" offset="8660804">In deciding this case, California believes that the Court should consider the purpose for which the Natural Gas Act was enacted and the impact, the decision of this Court will have on the consumers of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.318" offset="8725169">In deciding that, we would like to bring to your attention two factors in the gas market today that will have an effect on this case and have an effect on the Commission’s ability to ensure continuing, reliable and adequate supply of gas in the interstate market, that is shortages in natural gas in the interstate market and the disparity of price in the interstate, between the interstate and intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.189" offset="8864663">California, receiving over 90 percent of its gas from the interstate market, has found that there has been a significant decline in gas, some nine percent a year dedicated to that market and subsequently declining supplies to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.976" offset="8927879">This is true for the United States and this shown by the Amici Briefs of New York and the Associated Gas Producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.672" offset="8990678">The effect of the shortages were dramatically shown in the winter’s freeze of 1976, where natural gas could not get to the Northern tier states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.872" offset="9035399">It has an immediate effect on the health, well-being and economic viability of the gas consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.181" offset="9064657">Now, a major reason for these shortages is a disparity in price between the interstate and intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.013" offset="9092033">The intrastate market of course is unregulated and the price has been as high as over two dollars, a thousand cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.279" offset="9121081">The selling price in the interstate market is $1.44.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.756" offset="9134978">California is not here to disparage the fundamental economic motivation of someone to sell their gas at the highest price possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.408" offset="9169564">What we are bringing to the Court’s attention is that the chronic shortages in the interstate market combined with the disparity of price and added to this motivation to sell gas at the highest price possible, puts untenable pressures on the Commission to uphold this fundamental protection which is to ensure a continuing, adequate and reliable supply of gas in the interstate service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.713" offset="9898799">Well, my legal argument is, as the solicitor stated that gas cannot be removed, Section 7B says that, “The gas cannot be removed from interstate commerce once it is has been dedicated,” without a Section 7B, abandonment authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.784" offset="9971106">The gas in this case was dedicated to interstate commerce, an unlimited certificate was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.146" offset="9996497">Gulf had the right to dedicate all that gas, in fact, if the production circumstances had been different, Gulf could have sold all of that gas before the termination of the 50 years and the reversionary mineral interest owners had only a future expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.695" offset="10082701">Until that vested at the end of the 50 years, they did not what gas would be left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.326" offset="10101300">All of that gas was in fact dedicated in interstate market and could have been produced and sold in the interstate market and under the clear language of Section 7B, that gas once dedicated for whatever reason, no matter how justified the reason, cannot be removed from interstate commerce in the first instance, until the Commission, within its jurisdiction has determined that abandonment can be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2534.202" offset="10216761">Yes, it does, I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.049" offset="10228150">I would like to turn to two points raised by the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.343" offset="10253333">The first is that the leases could not be made that would terminate prematurely natural gas service in interstate commerce, because it would be against the economic interest of the producer to do so because of the initial cost of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.451" offset="10345701">I would like to make several comments on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.582" offset="10354270">First of all, we have the possibility of lease situations that affect adversely the consumer even though they do not necessarily affect the producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.958" offset="10395752">And we see this in cases now in the Court below more than the Fifth Circuit concerning the area of royalty gas, where the issue is whether the royalty payment to a lessor should be based on the intrastate or interstate price of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.299" offset="10465133">The secondary issue there is whether the gas, the lessor can terminate the lease, thereby causing the gas to revert back to the lessor, if the lessor does not receive the value that he thinks he should.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.873" offset="10535455">Under the theory of this case, that would avoid the abandonment provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.342" offset="10561264">Another factual situation concerns a lessor’s ability to retain a royalty interest with the right to convert that into a working interest, a situation that arose in the Tenth Circuit in the Phillips Petroleum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.650" offset="10630541">In that case, the lessor did convert the gas into a working interest and attempted to sell it as new gas in interstate commerce without seeking abandonment authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.154" offset="10672546">Now the Tenth Circuit held that that gas was dedicated but I think there is no guarantee that other Courts of Appeal would also hold that specially if in this case, the Fifth Circuit is upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.828" offset="10727298">There are other situations involving termination for lack of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.423" offset="10749659">A producer with a marginal well could find it in his best interest to simply abandon that well, allowing the gas lease to terminate and he could move on to more productive areas, but that avoids Section 7B abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.102" offset="10808382">Perhaps the Commission would find that that it is in the public interest to produce that marginal gas that that producer is still getting a fair rate of return.One overall comment in this area and one I would like to emphasize to the Court, it is a seller’s market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.126" offset="10864493">There is a tremendous chronic shortage of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.196" offset="10876719">Whether the producers like it or not, whether the Commission likes it or not, it is the theory of this case that leases can avoid Section 7B abandonment authorization is upheld, I think we will find a great many leases that include provisions that allow for termination if certain circumstances occur during the production in the life of the lease and neither the Commission nor producers will be able to do anything about it because those are the type of leases they are faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.437" offset="11001688">One last point concerning the issue raised about the cloud on real property in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.128" offset="11040454">First, what we perceive here is a Congressional regulatory requirement placed on interstate gas service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.058" offset="11080160">We do not see the cloud on real estate title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.981" offset="11091863">That gas has reverted to the reversionary mineral interest owners, they have full title to it, they will receive the proceeds for the sale of that gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.997" offset="11175977">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.174" offset="11188621">My name is Ebenezer Attwell and I appear here on behalf of the respondents Southland Royalty Company et all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.362" offset="11213385">I would like to start out by briefly summarizing our position and what we are asking this Court to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.876" offset="11239403">Then I want to turn to the reasons why Southland’s gas was not involuntarily dedicated to interstate service because Gulf made an interstate sale of Gulf's share of the Waddell Ranch Gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.471" offset="11293842">Finally, I want to conclude with a discussion of the practical consequences of this Court holding for Southland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.809" offset="11323204">Our position is very simple but it is very fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.044" offset="11340131">It is that you cannot sell what you never owned nor you you dedicate what you never owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.163" offset="11368552">This is true as a matter of property law and it is also true under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.544" offset="11390077">Therefore, this case does not present a conflict between State property law on the one hand and the Natural Gas Act on the other, nor does it involve the withdrawal or diversion of dedicated gas from the interstate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.936" offset="11447651">We recognize that if our gas has been dedicated, then in the words of Justice Brennan in Sunray, there can be no withdrawal of that supply from continued interstate movement without Commission approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.143" offset="11496552">But none of Southland’s gas has ever flowed in interstate commerce except under compulsion of the Commission’s orders in this case and those orders expressly provide that such for sales by Southland are without prejudice to its rights in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.216" offset="11556843">Therefore, the question before the Court is whether Southland’s share of the Waddell Ranch Gas was somehow dedicated to interstate service because Gulf made an interstate sale of its share of the Waddell Ranch Gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.733" offset="11610864">We recognize and agree that this dedication question is to be decided under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.525" offset="11642002">We say that because Gulf was never -- and I emphasize the word ‘never’ -- possessed of any rights in, or control over Southland’s interest in the Waddell Ranch Gas, it could not, it did not encumber that gas with an interstate service obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3885.642" offset="15622541">Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.490" offset="15641871">The Commissions relies on Justice Brennan's Sunray opinion to support its flow theory we believe is equally misplaced in this case because the record clearly shows that Southland has never sold any of its gas voluntarily, at least in the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.658" offset="15730583">The only physical flow that Gulf could indeed dedicate to interstate service was Gulf’s leasehold gas, a 50-year flow, and once Gulf commenced that flow the service had to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.022" offset="15788053">Sunray made it very clear that it could not withdraw that supply and Gulf has delivered all the leasehold gas but now Gulf’s supply is gone; it flowed and it is gone, and they applied for abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.084" offset="15848239">That in no way supports the Commission’s position that Gulf’s flow of Gulf gas somehow bound Southland, and we also recognize that under Sunray, the certificate issued to Gulf imposed a service obligation that was obviously separate and apart from the sale or obligation imposed by this contract, but Gulf’s service obligation applied only to Gulf’s share of the Waddell Ranch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.907" offset="15955550">The capacity of a producer to dedicate natural gas reserves we say is limited to the producer’s ownership rights in such reserves and does not extend to gas which the producer never had any ownership or other interest in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.880" offset="16023468">Let me illustrate that by saying that throughout the industry it is very commonplace for there to be a number of different interest owners in gas reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.831" offset="16059308">In fact that is lot more common than the contract and it is has been well established that if one producer in that gas reserve makes a sale of his interest, it in no way band binds or covers the other producers, and we say that is exactly the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.962" offset="16127749">Here is the Waddell Ranch, Gulf makes a sale of its interest, that is no way binding on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.785" offset="16151050">We say that is exactly analogous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.489" offset="16165888">Nor is it significant, we submit, that Gulf was issued a certificate of unlimited duration in this gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.708" offset="16198802">That simply meant that Gulf was obligated to sell all of its Waddell Ranch gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.268" offset="16228999">It did not mean that Gulf was somehow authorized to sell gas it did know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.025" offset="16248017">We would note that what is involved in this case is far different in what faced you in Sunray.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.711" offset="16270795">In that case, this Court required the producer to continue selling his only gas after the term of his contract because of its service obligation imposed by its certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.642" offset="16314472">In Sunray, the producer clearly had the right and power to continue to sell his gas after the contract expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.230" offset="16348849">By contrast,in the present case Gulf never had any power or right to sell Waddell Ranch gas after its lease expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.446" offset="16385734">Therefore, Gulf’s service obligation could not have extended to Southland’s gas; Gulf was not able in fact to sale Southland’s gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.695" offset="16426694">In my remaining time I would like to turn to the practical consequences of holding for Southland in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.287" offset="16469117">First, I think as far as this is narrow case is concerned the consequences or at the minimums.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.470" offset="16493777">There is this case and there are only three other fixed term lease cases and the relative volumes of gas compared to the over all minimums.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.192" offset="16532751">Second, holding for Southland in this case will not mean that gas dedicated on the typical life of reserves lease could escape from interstate service if such a lease is prematurely terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.174" offset="16588653">All that the Court need hold, and we say should hold in this case, is that one who has never had any interest in or control over gas cannot dedicate that gas to interstate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.881" offset="16639435">The typical life of reserves lease is of unlimited duration and unlike Gulf in this case the producer has the power at the time of dedication to dedicate whatever gas it finds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.161" offset="16700562">I do not think petitioners really take the firm position that the holding in this case would reach that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.697" offset="16730759">They say to theory of this case might be expanded to bind these ordinary lease situations where the producers has the power which unlike Gulf in this case to dedicate gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.017" offset="16779974">It does dedicate the gas and then the lease is prematurely terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.732" offset="16794916">We do not believe that this Circuit’s decision goes that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.819" offset="16807246">We think it is clear that Fifth Circuit’s decision is based on the fact that Gulf had no interest in or control over our gas reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.916" offset="16847579">In fact, that is the basis on which the Tenth Circuit distinguished it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.892" offset="16863461">Mr. George on behalf of California referred you to a recent Tenth Circuit decision in which the Commission had held that gas was dedicated and Phillips Petroleum Company appealed to the Tenth Circuit and the Commission was affirmed and the Tenth Circuit said Southland is not applicable because in that case, the lessee Gulf Oil never at any time had any interest in or control over Southland’s gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="4247.441" offset="17069724">I am saying that after 50 years they had absolutely no interest in any gas produced in the Waddell Ranch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.235" offset="17096892">If I misspoke myself, I apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.278" offset="17109013">In any event, if there is any question obviously in this Court’s mind as to the extent of the opinion below, we can obviously limit to the issue presented in this case which is whether one who has no interest in or control over gas can dedicate that gas to interstate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.616" offset="17186439">Such a holding, we submit, would be entirely consistent with the contrary holding if this Court were of that opinion and in these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.194" offset="17220712">Third, it is our position that holding for Southland in this case is not going to in any way result in this parade of horrors that the briefs have given you, this proliferation of short term leases, terminable at will under which producers can limit their service obligation in some manner and there by switch back and forth between the interstate and Intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.444" offset="17313708">The suggestion is really so devoid of economic reality as to be (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.929" offset="17335651">In response to earlier questions, I pointed out with producers who quit entering in to this leases many, many years ago for economic reasons and they are not going to do it again because they are spending hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars on these wells now and they are not going to subject themselves to a situation where their right to produce any gas could to cut off in five years or could be even worse cut off at the will of the lessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.553" offset="17454142">But even if future producers should try to do that and should approach the Commission with an application to make such a sale of gas, if the Commission determines that that quantity of gas that limited to a quantity in someway jeopardizes the public interest, we submit that it has and can and will protect the public interest just as it is done by refusing to issue certificates limited to the term of a producer’s contract, to issue the certificate or condition it on the producer obtaining a longer and more stable supply of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.349" offset="17617355">On the other side of the coin, if this Court is going to hold against Southland, it is going to have to adopt in effect a new rule of law in our opinion, and that is that one who never owned or had any interest in or control over gas can dedicate that gas to interstate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.394" offset="17689558">As we previously discussed, the authority for such a holding will have to be found in the Natural Gas Act and we do not believe there is anything whatsoever in the Natural Gas Act to indicate that Congress in any way intended such a radical alteration of established ownership rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.572" offset="17770224">In conclusion, I would like to briefly summarize the two points that we think are controlling in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.746" offset="17794884">First, a producer cannot dedicate gas which he has never owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.392" offset="17817558">This is true under property law and as I have discussed, it is true under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.820" offset="17839187">Second, Gulf never owned or had any interest in or control over Southland’s gas and therefore could not dedicate such gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.618" offset="17878371">From these two simple but indisputable points, we believe it is clear that Southland’s gas is not now and never has been dedicated to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.123" offset="17920480">Consequently, Southland is under no obligation to obtain abandonment authorization under Section 7B of the Natural Gas Act -- well suppose Southland can sell its gas to the purchaser of his choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.518" offset="17973979">For these reasons we respectfully urge that this Court affirm the decision below on the ground that under the Natural Gas Act, Gulf could not and did not dedicate Southland’s gas to interstate service.</text>

            <text syncTime="4494.483" offset="18057884">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.819" offset="18071259">I am grateful for the 10 minutes that has been allotted to me to express some concerns which we have for these broader legal implications that we think are inherent in this FPC order which the petitioners are seeking to uphold and if I may address first what I conceive this order to be so that I can demonstrate why our concerns are real both as to the effect of this order on the stability of our domestic drilling program which affects this entire nation, its effect on our State lands which we own and of course its effect on our consumers whose own gas supply is in jeopardy in many instances by this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.480" offset="18269894">Let me try to say why I believe this order conjures up kind of the potentiality of many, many adverse effects on established legal rights, what we thought were established legal rights prior to this FPC order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.597" offset="18338335">The order states on its face, and I am quoting from 443 of the Appendix: “Thus, it makes no different whether a lease is transferred or terminated, the obligation of service imposed upon the dedicated gas continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.571" offset="18402178">The duty to continue to serve is like an ancient covenant running with the land.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.252" offset="18424957">So in this order the FPC has held that as a matter of law, Gulf here created a federal covenant running with the land forever by making an interstate sale of Gulf 50-year gas commitment under this lease and so the order holds that although the land owner was not a party to the granting of that certificate, although it is suggested by Justice Rehnquist,the land owner could have been brought in as a condition to the granting of that certificate, a condition to Gulf that was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.297" offset="18593081">And although the land owner clearly is not a natural gas company within the meaning of 7B, and although Southland here is clearly not the owner of any facilities being used in service within the meaning of 7B, and although the land owner here is clearly the owner of different gas, gas that was never subjective or never could have been subjected to the jurisdiction of the Commission -- they use the word “to the Act” - you cannot subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission by an application gas you do not own.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.916" offset="18755563">Whether you say in that application, Justice Marshall, that I am just applying for a 50-years supply or whether you just attached your lease, you simply do not have the power to commit in that application any gas beyond that which you own and in spite of all that…</text>

            <text syncTime="4718.995" offset="18955974">That is the way they construe the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.659" offset="18962557">so, if you have constitutional issues, if the Act expressly said, they are constitutionally sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="4737.282" offset="19029117">But it is enough to say here that the gas from the acreage, their holding that the gas from this acreage must be forever sold into the interstate markets, that is the nubbin of our complaint, that even though it is a 50-year supply and a 50-year lease, that by this so-called covenant running with the land theory of the FPC and the order, that even after that lease expires, that gas has still to be sold into interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.499" offset="19149907">Now that legal resolve of that order bothers Texas because if gas is discovered in the future in our State, and we think a great deal will be discovered in the future I hope for the good of this country that it will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.704" offset="19214795">If that gas is discovered from a lease that has previously been under an expired lease, and I assure this Court and we set it out in our brief by checking with our land holdings that we know on the instance of state owned lands that there are many unexpired leases, some as many as eight and nine expired leases and I mean expired for legitimate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.817" offset="19315210">If under any of those expired leases it could be discovered later, if this FPC order here holds up, that there was some interstate gas sold back up the road even though it petered out and is no longer in the game that that would create a covenant running with that land so as to commit any new gas produced from that acreage into interstate commerce forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.357" offset="19421372">It takes little imagination to see what effect that has on the stability of titled searches a stability of drilling programs to know where you stand when you go in to make these deep tests which we are increasingly having to make to find gas in this country and as Justice White observed, this order here is broad enough to cover a situation where A obtains a certificate from the FPC and then gets in litigation with B who claims that he really owns the lease, even though A in good faith thought he owned it and B wins.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.552" offset="19574136">B, in spite of the fact he had nothing to do with the certification process, who was not involved top, side or bottom, could be held under this ancient covenant running with the land theory in this order to be subject to the FPC jurisdiction to interstate Commerce sale and to abandonment procedures for actions that he totally were un-authorized for him and in which he had no participation and presumably no knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.426" offset="19677685">Now then, when a producer in Texas is leasing today for new exploratory purposes under this order in the breadth of this order, that producer would have no assurance at all that if there had not been a previously lease applicable to that acreage, that would automatically subject his acreage to the FPC jurisdiction to interstate market…</text>
