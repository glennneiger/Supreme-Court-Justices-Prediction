            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="7.513" offset="109970">This is a labor law case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.465" offset="121777">The petitioner is a corporate employer covered by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.461" offset="149780">A group of petitioner's employees sought permission to distribute a union newsletter in nonworking areas of petitioner's property during nonworking time.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.659" offset="198577">The part of the newsletter discussed union affairs and part of it discussed minimum wage and right to work legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.343" offset="233268">Petitioner refused permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.963" offset="243821">The employees then filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.614" offset="274437">They alleged that the refusal violated Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act by interfering with their right under Section 7 to engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.081" offset="336294">The Board held that petitioner had violated the Act and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.436" offset="369627">We now affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.644" offset="386554">The entire newsletter concerned matters that could improve the terms and conditions of employment or otherwise improve the employees lot as employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.218" offset="436814">We therefore, think that the distribution of the newsletter was within the protection of the mutual aid or protection clause of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.450" offset="477774">In this case, neither petitioner's right to maintain discipline and production in its plant nor its property rights would be imped materially by allowing the newsletter to be distributed in nonworking areas during nonworking time.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.410" offset="549558">We, therefore, hold that the employees were entitled to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.229" offset="568889">Mr. Justice White has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.248" offset="580905">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice joins.</text>
