            <text syncTime="14.596" offset="138293">We granted certiorari in these two cases to consider important questions of federal state relations in the field of water law, an area of the law which is of more than merely academic interest of the people of the arid and semi-arid Western part of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.206" offset="204749">In California against the United States, United States government sought to impound about two-and-a-half million acre feet of water from California's Stanislaus River as part of its central valley reclamation project.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.575" offset="262218">The California State Water Resources Control Board, an institution in the city of California ruled that under State Water Law, the water could not be allocated to United States unless it agreed to various conditions dealing with the water's use.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.296" offset="325121">The United States there upon brought suit in the Federal District court in Sacramento seeking a declaratory judgment that it need not comply with State Water Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.896" offset="367544">The District Court held that while the United States must have apply to the State for appropriation permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.637" offset="394502">California had the issue to permit without condition, if there was sufficient unappropriated water.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.151" offset="420520">In the State appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.603" offset="438388">In an opinion filed today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.422" offset="449673">Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 provides that nothing in the Act should be construed as affecting or intended to affect or to in any way interfere with the laws of any states relating to the controlled appropriation use or distribution of water and the Section instructs the Secretary of the Interior to proceed in conformity with such laws in constructing reclamation projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.064" offset="544236">The legislative history of the Reclamation Act of 1902, indeed the entire history of congressional legislation in the field of federal water law, clearly demonstrates that Congress intended to differ to State law and the appropriation and distribution of water impounded by federal reclamations projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.473" offset="617797">California can impose any condition on the appropriation permits granted to the United States, that is not inconsistent with congressional directives.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.586" offset="650293">We disallow any statements in our earlier cases that might be read to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.728" offset="674848">Mr. Justice White joined by Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in the California case.</text>
