            <text syncTime="86.009" offset="423958">These consolidated cases from the Supreme Court of Mississippi and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit present a common central issue, and that is whether lands purchased by the United States and held in trust for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, and declared a reservation by the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act, constitute Indian country within the definition found in 18 U.S.C. 1151.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.438" offset="541718">The state case also presents a dependent issue, whether if these lands are Indian country, the Federal Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over crimes involving Indians, as they traditionally do, or whether the history of the Mississippi Choctaws in some way compels a departure from the generally accepted rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.230" offset="628863">Now, I would like to emphasize briefly at the outset that what we are talking about in terms of federal jurisdiction here is not a plenary, sovereign jurisdiction, excluding all state jurisdiction, but simply the limited preemptive authority over matters involving Indians that is common in Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.136" offset="716425">For reasons that I shall discuss, we believe that the Choctaw lands are Indian country, and thus is subject, insofar as crimes involving Indians are concerned, solely to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.112" offset="1108367">That does perhaps have a relevance to another issue, which I will mention in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.793" offset="1127070">These cases arise out of a single incident that occurred on the Choctaw lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.843" offset="1147341">In October 1975, a federal grand jury indicted respondent, John, who is a full-blooded Mississippi Choctaw Indian, for assault with intent to kill one Artis Jenkins, under 18 U.S.C. 1153, which the Court is familiar with, is the Major Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.899" offset="1219544">The indictment stated that the offense occurred on and within the Choctaw Indian Reservation, and on land within the Indian country under the jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.533" offset="1266042">In the trial the government requested an instruction, not only on the offense charged, but on assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.382" offset="1297493">While the defendant relying on Keeble vs. United States, 412 U.S., asked for an instruction on the lesser included offense of simple assault, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 113(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="318.085" offset="1352246">The instructions were given, the respondent was acquitted of the major crimes, but convicted of simple assault, sentenced to 90 days imprisonment, with $300 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.695" offset="1394669">After post trial motions, respondent appealed his conviction to the Fifth Circuit, arguing that although Keeble required the giving of an instruction on the lesser included offense, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a judgment of conviction on that offense, and this is in response to Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.441" offset="1469692">We have suggested that if the Court accepts our position on these lands as Indian country, that it remand the case to the Fifth Circuit to consider that issue, because it is possible that the race of the victim maybe a factor in determining that jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.772" offset="1538969">But the record simply does not show whether the victim was an Indian or non-Indian, and respondent did not urge that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.039" offset="1568122">In any event, the Fifth Circuit did not reach the issue but asked the Department of Justice to file a brief discussing whether the crime occurred in Indian country at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.592" offset="1602290">The Department of Justice took the position in its brief, a position with which respondent agreed, that the crime did occur in Indian country, but the Fifth Circuit disagreed, for reasons that I will discuss shortly, and reversed the convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.270" offset="1661013">Meanwhile, after the federal prosecution was completed, state authorities also obtained an indictment against John for exactly the same offense, charging aggravated assault under the Mississippi statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.347" offset="1709287">He moved to dismiss the indictment on grounds that the Federal Courts had exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.096" offset="1728305">The motion was denied, and he was convicted, and sentenced to two years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.437" offset="1749725">The Mississippi Supreme Court, in a decision that was actually rendered before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decision, held that these lands were not Indian country, and thus that the state had exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.645" offset="1798522">It therefore affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.444" offset="1813673">Now, turning first to the provisions of Section 1151, the statute defining Indian country, which are found at Page 40a of the appendix to our petition for certiorari, we submit that contrary to the conclusions reached by the courts below, these lands held in trust with the Choctaws fit very comfortably within the definition of Indian country found there.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.457" offset="1913774">To begin with, 1151(a) includes within Indian country all lands within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.253" offset="1960899">This Court for over 60 years has recognized that such Reservation lands, even if they are not original Indian lands, are Indian country, so long as the Court said in Donnelly, they are lawfully set apart as an Indian Reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.452" offset="2197777">The point that I was raising here is that for a certain time, it was recognized that only original Indian lands comprised of an Indian Reservation, and then in Donnelly, the Court departed from that, and for the first time recognized something that now has been picked up by Congress in the definition of Indian country, that they do not have to be original Indian lands, as long as they are lawfully set apart for the Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.624" offset="4350371">It is true that the treaty apparently contemplated that the Choctaws that did not go to the Western territory, would stay behind, would receive land, and would presumably fend for themselves as citizens of the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.543" offset="4406065">The United States certainly did not in the treaty surrender explicitly any power to help them if that proved to be unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.492" offset="4437934">The State of Mississippi of course is not entitled to rely on any promises there anyway, because it was not a party to the treaty, it was not made for their benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.320" offset="4469176">Even if the treaty could somehow be read to include that sort of promise by the United States, it is clear from the decisions of this Court that Congress can amend treaties by later treaties, and by subsequent legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.531" offset="4522048">It would seem to me extremely curious, as well as unfortunate, if that principle, which has often been used to change treaties over the Indian subjection, was now somehow unavailable to change a treaty for their benefit and with their acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.349" offset="4585369">Now, the point that Justice White makes is that after that period of time, they were no longer a tribe, and therefore that Congress', as I understand it, constitutional power had somehow lapsed over the Choctaws, but I think that is too grudging a view of Congress power in Indian affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.118" offset="4668438">Tribal existence ,like tribal sovereignty, provides the necessary backdrop for viewing the relationship between the American Indians and the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.243" offset="4716922">This Court has already recognized that a continuing tribal existence is not a sine qua non, but congressional power to deal with Indian affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.652" offset="4754538">For example, in the case that we have discussed in our brief, in McGowan, the Court approved the exercise as congressional jurisdiction over lands purchased for Indians in Nevada; many of whom were not members of an established tribe at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.344" offset="4813261">Indeed logically, if Congress lost its power to provide for the Indians at the instant that an individual Indian severed his tribal relationship, or the tribe for some reason disbanded, it would completely prevent Congress from experimenting with independence for the tribes, because once the tribe gained some measure of independence, to that degree, Congress would lose its ability to correct the situation if the tribes were unable to cope with that independence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.424" offset="6505578">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.599" offset="6526371">Our position on the basic Indian country issue in the case is the same as the United States, and I shall endeavor not to repeat Mr. Farrâ€™s arguments because we essentially agree with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.745" offset="6574855">I would like to say a few words in opening about the people that we are referring to as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, as I think it is relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.838" offset="6615292">The contemplation of the treaty advancing Rabbit Creek as the state correctly points out was that the Choctaws would either move to Oklahoma or assimilate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.899" offset="6659491">I think it is important to point out that there are really three groups of descendants from those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.959" offset="6679762">Those that moved to Oklahoma that obviously have no relevance to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.081" offset="6696272">Those that stayed in Mississippi, who did assimilate and intermarry with other Mississippi citizens, and those who did not assimilate, who are not all of the descendants, only those who remained a separate and distinct Indian Community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.815" offset="6751234">An Indian Community, most of the members of which were entirely of Indian ancestry, continued to speak to Choctaw language, continued to practice traditional Choctaw social customs and relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.967" offset="6799821">In 1918, when the United States came in and recognized that assimilation as to this particular group had not worked, at that time, Your Honors, the state of Mississippi, and I think in a significant way recognized the distinct nature of this group of people, because the state of Mississippi was then providing public schools for white Mississippi children and black Mississippi children and even Chinese Mississippi children, but not for this group of Indian people; they were the only people in Mississippi not entitled to go to any public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.384" offset="6921447">One of the reasons for the restoration of the federal assistance to them was this rather unique status that they had recognized by the state in that manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.235" offset="7684850">There is some disjunctive nature of the lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.590" offset="7694254">However, it seems to us that the statutes contemplate that in part with the definition of Indian country in 18 U.S.C. 1151(b), which says dependent Indian Communities are Indian country, and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Martin case, which we cite in our brief, ruled that a community very much like these is Indian country under I think rather similar circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.558" offset="7802192">Also, we would point out that disjointed land ownership has been a feature of Indian country for many purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.161" offset="7840540">In the McGowan case, the Court sustained Indian country status for a piece of land purchased in Nevada for Nevada Indians, and that is my point about the relationship between the statutes and the Courtâ€™s decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.484" offset="7893829">The Court rendered four or five decisions defining Indian country between 1913 and 1938, and it is very clear from the legislative history of the 1948 statute that Congress was codifying those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.763" offset="7942940">It was recognizing those decisions as the law, and putting them into the statute books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.318" offset="7961225">So I think there is a very close relationship between the statutes and the decisions, which makes the decisions, even though they are prior to the statute, quite relevant to its meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.871" offset="8091420">Yes, except this statute was new at that time. I realized that most of that 48 codification was a codification of existing statutes, but there was no existing Indian country statute at that time except for an obscure portion of the liquor statutes which said the allotments were Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.029" offset="8164040">Other than that, the only definition of Indian country in federal law prior to 1948 was essentially the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.728" offset="8194865">It was treated as a common law issue, except for this one liquor statute which included allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.686" offset="8222659">But the definition of allotments in the Indian country statute, which again as I emphasized, codified prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.000" offset="8255887">That is 18 U.S.C. 1151(c), obviously contemplates some disjointed landownership, and I think Congress has made its decision that Indian country may so exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.167" offset="8300608">The Court has almost explicitly recognized that in the Decoto decision just a few years ago, and therefore we do not see that that is any disability with regard to the lands involved here being Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.043" offset="8356092">In fact, the tract of land recognized by the Court as Indian country in McGowan was I believe about 28 acres, and the tract of land on which the crime we are concerned with here occurred is over 300 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.125" offset="8404471">So as far as identifying an area as Indian land, there would be less difficulty in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.183" offset="8452641">The principle argument that the state raises is that the United States by entering into the 1830 scheme irretrievably lost its authority over the Choctaw Indians in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.417" offset="8517634">In response, we contend that the actions of the United States since 1918 very clearly evidenced an intent on the part of both Congress and the executive department to recognize again a portion of the descendants of the Choctaw people who are involved in 1830, as we have already said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.035" offset="8592030">We think that, that kind of authority has been continuously and unanimously recognized by the Court since the beginning of the Republic, until the two cases below; they are the first time I can find where the United States, the political departments of this government, have ever been disabled from dealing with people who are manifestly American Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.318" offset="9085222">I think a fair argument can be made that the power is justified by the Constitution and that the Court should not overturn it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.995" offset="9111867">What one might say is, that sort of exercise of the power would be unwise, but there are many exercises of legislative and executive authority that appear unwise, but the Courts have no authority to overturn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.273" offset="9157007">I rather think that would be my opinion in answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.076" offset="9172262">It would depend in part on how one defined Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.555" offset="9182189">If you meant anyone descended from an American Indian tribe, as my client is, then I would answer yes, the authority lies, and the Courts have no power to overturn it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.555" offset="9250107">One of the main reasons that we feel that there is no question about federal authority is that the Court has consistently left this question of recognizing who are Indians under federal authority to the political departments of the government, and it is absolutely unprecedented to have the Courts second guessing that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.015" offset="9335998">The government responsibility is based on initial political relation with an Indian tribe, but once there is an Indian tribe, as there clearly was with the Choctaws, the Court has not held and should not hold that fragmentation or even termination of a tribe cannot be undone if the government later determines that the policy was unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.881" offset="9415410">The federal policy with regard to Indians has obviously often split tribes, fragmented tribes, by war, conquest, treaty, or otherwise, and what we contend has consistently been recognized by the decisions of this and the other Federal Courts is that United States can deal with the results of those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.063" offset="9492210">Where the United States takes actions that results in the splitting or fragmenting of a tribe, the United States does not by those actions lose its power to deal with the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.676" offset="9538603">In fact, of course, the Indian people who are affected by actions like that are often those most in need, as well illustrated by the facts and the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.274" offset="9572980">This Court sustained the constitutionality of the Indian Major Crimes Act, the statute that is basically at issue here in 1886, in the decision of United States against Kagama, and in that very decision, the Court recognized I think the principles that control this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.889" offset="9631495">The decision referred expressly to the remnants of a race once powerful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.458" offset="9653751">The word remnants which one might use to describe the remnants of the Choctaw tribe of Mississippi that we are dealing with here was used by the Court in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.284" offset="9689069">Furthermore, the facts of that case are rather similar, was a Reservation established well after California had become a state on lands that were set aside after California had become a state, and if you will, I suppose there was an interim between 1850, when California became a state, and sometime after that when the Reservation was set aside when those Indians were technically under state jurisdiction, just as the people we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.136" offset="9788438">Furthermore in that case, the Court noted very explicitly that the government is empowered to deal with Indians in part as a result of the consequences of conquest of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.451" offset="9837758">The Court explicitly noted that conquest has rendered the Indians dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.370" offset="9857402">I believe the Court emphasized that in the recent decision in the Oliphant case, that conquest rendered the Indians dependent on the United States, and that dependence was relied on in the Kagama decision, interpreting this very statute as giving the United States authority to deal with Indians in the manner that we are talking about here, to provide a criminal code for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.780" offset="9959070">If the action of 1830 were deemed irreversible as Mississippi contends, it would severely hamper federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.708" offset="9986760">It would allow no corrective action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.164" offset="9996582">It would cause problems elsewhere, because that kind of reassertion of power has occurred elsewhere, and we contend that there is no precedent for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.209" offset="10040781">I would next like to point out that when the Major Crimes Act jurisdiction exists, when there is Federal Court jurisdiction as was exercised here by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi to prosecute my client, when that exists, this Court and all the other Federal Courts have always held that, that authority is exclusive of state authority over the same crime that it precludes or preempts state authority over the same crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.727" offset="10162825">This Court has twice held that as a holding; in the Seymour case and in Rice against Olson which we have cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.700" offset="10190724">The Lower Federal Courts have held it in numerous circumstances. The Court has noted it in dictum frequently, and most recently in the Antelope case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.495" offset="10217891">We can see no reason why Mississippi is any different in this regard from any other state in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.938" offset="10239730">The fact that the Indians involved were for a time under state jurisdiction does not serve to distinguish the situation in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.712" offset="10270763">As I have pointed out, there have been frequent examples in the history of the country where Indians were for a time under state authority, but federal jurisdiction to establish a Reservation was then asserted, and they came under federal jurisdiction, and that authority has been sustained by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.616" offset="10354355">In conclusion, we agree with the United States that this land was Indian country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.797" offset="10375149">If it is Indian country, the Major Crimes Act on its face applies, the Federal Court has jurisdiction, and we contend that the subsequent state prosecution for precisely the same offense was therefore preempted by valid federal authority, and that the conviction and/or judgment of conviction entered by the Mississippi Court should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.865" offset="12847377">If they are relying on the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, it addresses itself to tribal reorganization, and other matters, and states such things as a majority of the tribe may agree to come under this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.185" offset="12916654">There was no list that I can find of any particular Choctaw tribe in Mississippi at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.277" offset="12953016">These were individuals living (Inaudible) as we have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.125" offset="12976422">What is the majority of a number that today ranges between three and 5,000 people?</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.176" offset="13008605">It is an indefinite, impossible situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.627" offset="13022398">Then we find another peculiarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.393" offset="13033474">The Relief Act of 1918 which Congress -- first time as far as I know that Congress had recognized any Indians in Mississippi directly since 1830, provided for certain relief and the purchase of land to be sold to the Choctaws on a repayable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.945" offset="13119678">This is where the land purchase started, because the Choctaws took the land, but did not pay for it, and the government represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.581" offset="13158234">This in turn produced the 1939 Act to clarify the land title, as to who should have title to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.591" offset="13194283">So in the 1934, it is to me an impossible situation to suggest that a group of people across a state could satisfy the basic requirements of coming together in an organization function, getting majority out of them to approve at a proper election, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.776" offset="13270979">Now, what I was going to say was that the 1918 Act addressed itself to whole blood Choctaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.630" offset="13302430">The Indian Reorganization Act addressed itself to half-blood Choctaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.845" offset="13323328">The record is devoid of any anthropological study or otherwise to determine who was a whole blood and who was a half- blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.387" offset="13365438">Presumably, they had something to go on because some ten years before 1918, acting under the Dawes Commission Authority, agents had gone into Mississippi and attempted to round up and get together various people of Choctaw descent, so that they could join the tribe in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.545" offset="13478078">That is where the tribe and the tribal authority that Congress dealt with had been since 1830 removal from Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.696" offset="13530740">Congress has not created any tribal status for Mississippi Choctaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.906" offset="13555505">The Act that the Secretary of Interior relied on, did not address itself to Mississippi Choctaws.</text>
