            <text syncTime="109.617" offset="438439">The question presented by this appeal is whether the inspection provisions of the Act and their implementing regulations that authorize representatives of the Secretary of Labor during regular working hours and that other reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner to conduct warrantless inspections of the portions of commercial premises routinely occupied by an employer's workforce violate the Fourth Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.017" offset="615967">A three-judge court held that provision unconstitutional and we submit that it is an erroneous holding and respectfully request this Court to reverse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.898" offset="679497">The chronology of events that brings this matter before the Court is brief and as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.969" offset="719830">On September 11, 1975, an Occupational Safety and Health inspector called for a routine inspection of appellee's premises in Pocatello, Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.099" offset="784300">These premises were devoted to the heating and cooling business and he sought to make a so-called general schedule inspection, a term now superseded and called a regional programmed inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.792" offset="867161">That is to say the inspection was not in response to any complaint by an employee or was referenced to anything other than a determination by the area officer that this kind of business enterprise would be inspected within this community.</text>

            <label>Mr. McCree Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="249.921" offset="999654">It would be limited to the premises, the work premises, occupied by Barlow's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.478" offset="1033822">It did not include the right to inspect books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.957" offset="1055765">And it would be limited only to the areas routinely occupied and only during working hours or other reasonable times.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.156" offset="1096620">General McCree, did the super session that you just referred to have any substantive consequences or was it just a change in name?</text>

            <label>Mr. McCree Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="281.898" offset="1127549">To the best of my knowledge, it's just a change of name.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.769" offset="1139043">I found general schedules somewhat difficult to comprehend too and regional programmed inspection indicates that what has happened is certain geographical areas are inspected on a determination that as the labor department indicates, the worst first to go to the premises that contained the greatest hazards to employee safety initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.927" offset="1263700">And these are determined by reporting schedules from programs like Workmen's Compensation Programs that regularly advise about the incidents of industrial accidents and other disabling occurrences.</text>

            <label>Mr. McCree Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="341.990" offset="1367876">Yes, if the Court please, the regional officers received the reports to which I made reference and determine then which industries produce the greatest number of industrial injuries and occupational disablements.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.639" offset="1446452">And then within the industries where geographically they may be located and the schedules are determined on priorities based upon considerations such as that.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="375.253" offset="1500996">Those schedules of public information, what I'm interested in with five million businesses subject to the Act on 80,000 inspections made last year is what guidelines or objective criteria, if any exist, that control the exercise of discretion by the individuals who decide whether this business or that business is to be inspected?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mccree_jr" startTime="402.539" stopTime="551.921">
            <label>Mr. McCree Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="402.539" offset="1610083">If the Court please, there is a -- there is a publication to which I'd like to reference, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.633" offset="1666508">I -- I do not have it at fingertip.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.629" offset="1674449">I'll have it when I return to the lecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.293" offset="1689078">Publication that I suppose is discoverable, thank you, by any interested person.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.062" offset="1724186">It's a field performance evaluation system that is adopted for the guidance of regional programs by the office of field performance evaluations and it has captioned the worst first program scheduling guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.190" offset="1816660">And it indicates the industries which will first be inspected on the basis of data that is later appearing in this publication indicating the nature of the enterprise, its relative rank in producing disabling accidents and other occurrences, the number of employees, the number of establishments and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.662" offset="1934629">And so, it is not an arbitrary determination at all, but it has a rational basis and as far as I can determine, it's available for inspection by persons who are interested in knowing when their turn is coming about.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.110" offset="2016340">The inspector first called at Barlow's on September 11, 1975, properly identified himself by producing his credentials and made an offer of a toll-free call to the proprietor who was present on the premises to permit him to ascertain the authenticity of the inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.559" offset="2122188">The proprietor denied the inspector admission for the purpose of making the inspection, stating that he believe the Fourth Amendment immunized him from such an inspection in the absence of a search warrant, which the inspector admitted that he did not have.</text>

          <turn speaker="mccree_jr" startTime="562.418" stopTime="600.594">
            <label>Mr. McCree Jr.</label>

            <text syncTime="564.121" offset="2256457">We concede that there was no particular rise of reason for inspecting Barlow's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.152" offset="2288536">We suggest, however, that on the basis of inspections, administrative inspections being authorized where a reasonable scheme exists for inappropriate governmental -- to serve an appropriate governmental interest that a search would be permitted and that under the standards of Camara and See, an inspection warrant would have been issued had one been sought.</text>

            <label>Mr. McCree Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="621.294" offset="2485081">Well, the secretary has adopted a regulation that provides in summary that the area and Assistant Regional Director and the Regional Solicitor shall promptly take appropriate action including compulsory process if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.889" offset="2571494">Now, as a matter of practice, the regional inspectors have then gone to the courts to obtain an order requiring the proprietor to submit to the inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.567" offset="2622171">And indeed, that was done here on the 30th of December, the District Court to which the application was made after issuing an order to show cause to which Barlow's responded with counsel, issued an order requiring entry for the purpose of inspection.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.661" offset="2718616">And what does the United -- what does the United States -- what does the inspector submit to the Court to get such an order?</text>
            <text syncTime="685.343" offset="2741290">Just as he -- just make the presentation such as you did that there is a reasonable inspection scheme and the statute permits it and we want to get in?</text>
            <text syncTime="694.184" offset="2776712">Is that it?</text>

            <label>Mr. McCree Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="694.543" offset="2778070">That is essentially the representation he makes to the Court and the Court in this case issued an order to show cause which permitted the employer to appear and assert any objection he might have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1453.646" offset="5814544">Of course, Marsh, as I recall it, was a case where religious literature was being distributed on the premises and we're not even seeking an intrusion of that extent because we suggest that this is even more restrictive but 30 years ago, the Court recognized that when a person allows someone else to use his property, he gives up an expectation of privacy at least congruent with that person's rights or some of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.289" offset="5957068">And we suggest here that where the safety of the employees who are gathered on the premises for his advantage is a legitimate concern of the Congress as expressed in this legislation that these inspections do not therefore intrude upon any privacy interest of the business, and that no warrant should be required to permit an inspection to see that this public interest is carried out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1760.254" offset="7040940">I'd like to open by going directly to a question, asked my friend, the Solicitor, by Chief Justice Burger with regard to the degree of brevity found here in the relationship between the employer and the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.292" offset="7101127">It seems to me in essence here that the Secretary of Labor is attempting to state the department has the right to come into the premises involved here, so to speak on the back of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.594" offset="7166328">Now, the Commerce Clause in the Constitution does give Congress the power to regulate commerce and perhaps to the extent there are employees in a work premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.186" offset="7216692">There is then a commensurate right as Congress so found to inspect, but that is not the same thing as saying, “They have the right to inspect without a warrant.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.536" offset="7330064">But the -- I believe that the point here to be made initially for opening is this, that throughout the presentation and throughout the brief of the United States, there is a constant shifting back and forth between the question -- between the issue, I should say, of the power to inspect to the Commerce Clause and the right to enter without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.114" offset="7436434">Now, the -- I would like to go directly from that with regard to this -- to this question of a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3620.610" offset="14482390">We would conclude, if the Court please, by suggesting that there are two steps to our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.191" offset="14512692">First, whether the inspection is reasonable and we think in Camara, this Court has indicated that area searches and things like area searches under proper legislative pronouncements are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.271" offset="14577058">And then, of course, the question becomes whether a warrant, an inspection warrant is required and in Biswell, this Court told us something about the purpose of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.318" offset="14625228">It suggested that a major protection was little of any threat to the effectiveness of the inspection system there at issue could be forwarded by an inspection warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.172" offset="14680607">Now, whether this major protection overbalances the effectiveness of the inspection systems seems to be the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.877" offset="14727419">And here, the unannounced inspect -- inspection is a critical part of the statutory scheme as this Court pointed out in Biswell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.949" offset="14787709">Very little would be gained by not requiring for the effectiveness of the system by not -- let me rephrase that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.263" offset="14837029">That the inspection system in Biswell would not -- or in See -- in See would not be impaired by requiring an inspection warrant, because structural defects in the buildings would be relatively long standing and relatively difficult to change easily and then made it in Biswell that if notice went to the gun dealer that the person contemplated an inspection, he would remove the -- he might remove the contraband from his presence.</text>
