            <label>Mr. John B. Abercrombie</label>
            <text syncTime="25.872" offset="183422">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.721" offset="198782">This case arose out of refusal of Eastex to allow distribution of a union circular on its plant premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.038" offset="236085">The circular is found on pages 2 and 3 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.134" offset="256460">The refusal was because Sections 2 and 3 of the circular were considered to have no relevance to any matter concerning petitioner's employees as employees and was political in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.644" offset="314452">Petitioner had no objection to Sections 1 and 4 of the circular.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.474" offset="337858">Section 2 of the circular consisted of a polemic against inclusion by a Texas constitutional convention of a right to work provision in a proposed revised constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.983" offset="391879">Section 3 contained criticisms of then President Nixon’s veto of a minimum wage bill, comments about oil industry profits and requested employees to register to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.099" offset="448304">Over one half of Section 3 was concerned with oil industry profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.367" offset="469410">Sections 2 and 3 of the circular made up the bulk.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.007" offset="491980">There was no evidence in this case that petitioner had taken a stand either pro or con with relation to any matter discussed in Sections 2 or 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.889" offset="539523">The record is clear that the union had previously publicized its political messages by mail and with lists furnished by Eastex and that its only reason for requesting in-plant distribution of this circular was increased mailing cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.624" offset="610472">There is no evidence that distribution off the plant premises was impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.420" offset="637639">The administrative law judge decided the case solely on Section 7 grounds, no consideration of Eastex’s property rights was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.809" offset="679121">The Board pro forma affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.003" offset="691974">The Fifth Circuit originally granted enforcement under Section 7 and the First Amendment and adopted the holding that the union could distribute whatever is reasonably related to the employees' jobs or status or condition as employees to the full range permitted by Section 7’s language, valid local laws and the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.411" offset="801584">On motion for rehearing, the Court excised its First Amendment references, but denied rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.369" offset="849440">The basic issue before the Court today is whether the mutual aid or protection language of Section 7 of the Act protects a distribution on an employer’s premises which is political in nature and is not significantly related to the employees' immediate employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.627" offset="938465">That issue divides into two parts; whether the mutual aid or protection language of Section 7 protects political expression and if it found that it does, does the nature and strength of such a right mandate or warrant the interference with the employer’s property rights which is inherent in an in-plant distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.953" offset="1135742">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we believe that that is part of the basic question of whether the mutual aid or protection language of Section 7 protects political expression, but to the extent that Republic Aviation states that there is a right to in-plant distribution, that case is of course limited by its terms to in-plant distribution by employees relating to organizational effort.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.562" offset="1306165">And my question to you is even though one were to conclude that the sort of literature that were to be -- that was sought to be distributed here was covered under Section 7 and even though the Board were permitted to conclude under the Act that some distribution were permissible on the employer’s property, would it necessarily be entitled to simply use the Republic Aviation formula without any reweighing of factors?</text>

            <text syncTime="334.508" offset="1417969">No sir and that is exactly what the Board and the Fifth Circuit did in this case was to use the presumptive invalidity of the refusal to distribution, the presumptive rule of right to distribute on an employee’s property, growing out of Republic Aviation was of course based on the organizational efforts of employees under the fundamental provisions or the fundamental rights of Section 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.770" offset="2723046">The Board admits as much on page 34 of its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.316" offset="2741228">We believe that this Court should draw the same sharp distinction between political activity and traditional and fundamental union representation activity that it drew in International Association of Machinists vs. Street and more recently, in Abood vs. Detroit Board of Education, certainly in a different context.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.552" offset="2838090">This Court recognized in Street and Abood, the separation between a union’s pursuit of its traditional role as a collective bargaining representative and its ancillary role as a political, social and fraternal organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.985" offset="2911859">We would also state to the Court that thus it is clear that Section 7 is not coextensive with the First Amendment as the Board and the Court below impliedly assert, nor is the employer’s plant a public park or a marketplace of ideas.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.652" offset="3058563">This is a Section 7 case, but we would submit that the Board and the Court below have impliedly made it a First Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.544" offset="3110077">By the assertion that the Board makes in its brief that the employer has not right to prevent distribution of union literature so long as it does now disrupt production or discipline and contains material relating to any union objectives, is a First Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.733" offset="3198893">No prior restraint except in case of clear or present danger or disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.461" offset="3229717">Another fault of the Board and the Court below in this case is the assertion and the finding that the term employee used in Section 7 of the Act encompasses the generic employee as a worker of the world and that petitioner's employees are protected under Section 7 in rendering “mutual aid or protection to such workers as a broad class.”</text>
            <text syncTime="819.870" offset="3359389">This is also inherent in the Court’s rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.820" offset="3375167">Certainly the language of Section 2 and 3 of the Act defining employee, encompasses more than employees of a particular employer, but we submit that it is no broader than the definition of labor dispute found in Section 29 of the Act and that a union’s rights to distribute on our premises or to deal in relationship with employees as workers is no broader than the definition of labor organization found in the provisions of Section 25 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.811" offset="3551128">We might add to this Court that the Board itself has found that political literature is not protected wherein the Ford Motor Company case, it stated wholly political propaganda, not related to employee’s problems and concerns while employees can be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.768" offset="3635033">The Board and the Court below would distinguish the particular political expression used on the grounds that it was reasonably related to the employee’s jobs or their status or condition as employees in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.333" offset="3705250">Apart from such rationale, the Court below would apparently agree that it was unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.127" offset="3736388">As our brief points out, the logical extension of such a rule would result in the politicalization of the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.896" offset="3775468">But we have also pointed out, the Court’s finding results from the Court’s consideration of the term employee as used in Section 7 of the Act in the generic sense which is overly broad and we submit is in error and does not take into consideration the purposes and policies of the Act to regulate the relations between an employer and his employees or the limited intrusion on an employer’s property rights allowed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.970" offset="3911827">Place is of equal concern in defining Section 7 rights as is substance or actions taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.415" offset="3945577">It is only by limiting the protections of the other mutual aid or protection language of Section 7 to in-plant distributions which concern a matter significantly connected to the employee’s relationship to their employer that the policies of the Acts, the conflicts between opposing rights and the practical operation of employer/employee relations can be reconciled and harmonized.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.545" offset="4078070">This Court has never said and should not say here that any yielding of an employer’s property rights is necessary, except where an employer – except where they are in conflict with the fundamental right of self organization, representation and collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.828" offset="4159259">As this Court said in Central Hardware and I quote, “This principle requires a yielding of property rights only in the context of an organization campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.348" offset="4209309">Absent such a yielding, there is no Section 7 right on an employer’s property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.596" offset="4234282">Republic Aviation referred to by Mr. Justice Rehnquist required a yielding only in the posture that prohibition of in-plant solicitation was an unreasonable impediment to the exercise of the right to self organization and then only on non-work time and in non-work areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.496" offset="4321949">Babcock &amp; Wilcox did not require such a yielding in the absence of a showing of a special need, but again in an organizing context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.397" offset="4361551">Magnavox cited by the Board in its brief was a waiver case, but to the extent that it dealt with the problem, it was concerned with fundamental Section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.969" offset="4411810">A key footnote omitted in the Magnavox quotation in the Board’s brief makes it clear that this Court has not extended Republic Aviation as the Board asserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.417" offset="4461548">That footnote states to indicate consideration of alternative means of communication is at least a part of the range of any inquiry into the need for in-plant solicitation if Section 7 rights are to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.330" offset="4533228">Republic, Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Magnavox can be delineated as who and where cases in connection with self organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.816" offset="4587144">This case – this Eastex case seeks to define what can be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.016" offset="4619954">Section 7 does not exist in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.406" offset="4633538">Section 7 rights coexist with other competing interests and as this Court has stated, the exercise of such rights must be balanced against such competing interest to determine where they fall on this spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.972" offset="4699784">Organizational activity is obviously an overriding consideration under the Act, but even there, it has been circumscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.723" offset="4742834">Political expression is at the other end of the spectrum, if it protected at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.538" offset="8446057">The principle issue in this case is the first issue whether the activity comes within the scope of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.784" offset="8479076">That is an issue that goes beyond the particular facts of this case because if as petitioner quite clearly contends, Section 7 does not cover or bear on the distribution of the news bulletin because of its content, then nothing in the National Labor Relations Act would prohibit an employer from restraining employees by any means including discharge for distributing the bulletin either on or off the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.150" offset="8596522">Mr. Abercrombie has made that quite explicit today and in connection with Mr. Chief Justice’s remarks, it is clear Mr. Chief Justice that Section 7 does apply to activity – to distribution of material off the premises on the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.646" offset="8670501">If for instance this material was being distributed on the sidewalk and the employer discharged the employee for doing that, then we would contend that the employer has violated Section 8 (a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act because he has interfered with the exercise of Section 7 rights of his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.221" offset="8756810">Now, the petitioner contends that the distribution of the news bulletin is not covered by Section 7 at all because in its view, Section 7 only applies to at least as it is stated in its brief and I quote from page 13 of its brief, “Activities which are related to a specific dispute with the employer over an issue which the employer has the right or power to control.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.871" offset="8851373">Today, in oral argument, Mr. Abercrombie advanced additional reasons for its contention that the distribution of the news bulletin was not covered by Section 7 and namely that it involved what he termed to be political matters and also because it allegedly did not involve organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="3681.459" offset="14805724">The Board's focus in this argument is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.457" offset="14825786">We are not talking about Section 7 as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.895" offset="14843549">We are only talking about non fundamental rights under the other mutual aid or protection language of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.031" offset="14884091">The suggested rule which we have advanced in our brief has application only in this context and I would respond to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question, there was no discussion in the administrative law judge's opinion of the basis for his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.915" offset="14971549">He simply cited the presumption of invalidity by the -- because of the limited distribution or the limitation on distribution of this material on the employer’s premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.712" offset="15046782">The Board and the court below have placed the cart before the horse on the matter of accommodation of Section 7 rights to property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.609" offset="15098400">I note Mr. Allen’s reference to our naked property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.368" offset="15117417">We are quite proud of that naked property right and believe that we have a right to enforce it under the constitution and the laws of this country except in those instances where they would amount to an unreasonable impediment to the organization of employees on the employer’s premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.905" offset="15203517">The Board would adopt a presumption of right of any Section 7 rights, presumably, including the right to picket on the employer’s premises in the absence of showing by the employer of special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.046" offset="15272062">Certainly no balancing was undertaken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.257" offset="15292960">The presumption alluded to by the Board only relates to distributions affecting fundamental section rights, particularly the right to organize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.678" offset="15354609">This Court has never said that the presumption is applicable to any union distribution regardless of its content.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.274" offset="15393061">The distinction between what is distributable and appliant is one of substance in the same sense as that issue was addressed in Babcock and Wilcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.371" offset="15437365">There the Board made the same assertion that it did hear that Republic Aviation established a presumption of the right of a non-employee organizer to enter the employer's premises for the purposes of organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.307" offset="15493162">The Court held that here was no such presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.508" offset="15505910">That only by showing of special need to do so could a non-employee enter the employee's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.126" offset="15536421">We suggest that there has been no accommodation made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.732" offset="15554811">but that because of the nature of the literature that is being distributed, political in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.565" offset="15586158">That the accommodation must necessarily fall on the right of the employer to prohibit such distribution in the exercise of his property rights and that as a matter of law, the distribution of political material on the employers premises is and cannot be allowed under the provisions of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
