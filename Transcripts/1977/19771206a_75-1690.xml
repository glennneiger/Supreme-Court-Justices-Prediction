            <text syncTime="84.213" offset="416748">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.263" offset="428973">This case comes to this Court from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.862" offset="451334">At issue is the constitutionality of the Georgia Statute, which recognizes the right of parents and guardians to make application for admission of their minor children to State Mental Health facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.865" offset="495428">This law suit is predicated upon two grounds, the first ground is that these children have a constitutionally protected right to challenge their parent's medic decisions as to what medically indicated treatment will be provided to children and that the challenge statute here which provides for neither notice nor hearing before hospitalization deprives them of that right with that due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.453" offset="585708">The second ground is that mentally ill children have a constitutional right when they receive state treatment from the State, to receive that treatment only in the treatment setting which is most appropriate to their condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.607" offset="638370">This law suit was brought by two boys age 12 and 13 at the time of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.726" offset="658850">Each had been in state mental health facility for over five years, each had been admitted under the Challenge Code Section one by his parents, the other by his guardian and State Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.183" offset="696676">At the time of the trial of the litigation we admitted that these two boys as well as 44 other children who were then in the mental health facility could be treated for their condition in other facilities which we considered more appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.464" offset="749757">Two facts which do not appear in the record, but which I want to bring to Court's attention is that one of the plaintiffs is now deceased J.L. the other is that, some of these children are still in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.953" offset="799703">The District Court in essence agreed with appellees on both grounds, finding that in fact the children have a liberty interest and that they were deprived of it by the operation of this statute and finding that the children had a substantive due process right which was violated by the operation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.439" offset="869711">There are in essence two issues before the Court then, the first is whether these children are entitled to procedural due process rights and whether they receive it under statue and the second is whether the children have a right if they are to receive treatment from the State to receive that treatment only in the best facility, turning to the first issue --</text>

            <text syncTime="215.633" offset="942436">I thought earlier you had said something to the effect that the request, the demand was for treatments suitable to their needs or something that effect, now you mean that to be the same as the best treatment available?</text>

            <text syncTime="292.895" offset="1251517">They are in essence with respect to the procedure due process issue, three sub issues, one of which the Court itself advanced that being the question of State Action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.577" offset="1290282">The other two are the question of whether a child in fact has a liberty interest in this situation and if a child does have liberty interest there is State Action what processes do.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.134" offset="1332496">Turning first to the liberty interest we look to the District Court's analysis of the case the District Court said in essence that children have a liberty interest for the Supreme Court of United States said so in its decision in the case of Henry Goll (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="326.915" offset="1387562">Hospitalization is a massive curtailment of that liberty for again the Supreme Court said so in Humphrey versus Cady.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.670" offset="1414625">The District Court then put the two together and concluded that these children were deprived of liberty interest or that due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.386" offset="1441479">Our position is, is that the District Court's analysis is flawed because the District Court focused on the wrong interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.758" offset="1466975">It is a fundamental or a threshold issue that in any litigation where what is challenged or what is alleged is a deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest that you must look to the interest itself to see whether in fact it can be fairly said as in this case to fall within the diameter of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.170" offset="1532594">Well we suggested the Court that the interest is here is the interest in the child to challenge his parent's medically indicated decision, for that is exactly what the District Court is allowing the child to do by asserting that the child is deprived of the liberty interest by being hospitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.113" offset="1596333">It is our position that this analysis is inconsistent with the inferences that can be drawn from this Court's opinions, State Court decisions as well as the history of western civilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.581" offset="1642204">In our civilization in our society we have determined that children cannot make certain decision for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.758" offset="1670939">One of these decisions that we -- one of these area in which we have made this determination is in the area of selecting medically indicated treatment both at common law and in case law of this country, we have said that parents select medically indicated treatment for there children, their children do not select that treatment themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.832" offset="3039233">Let me get back to your question or your point Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.548" offset="3054070">What our point is, is if we say that there is a liberty interest here, then similarly there is a liberty interest in that child who is going to have his tonsils taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.699" offset="3082700">I think we perhaps used a really gruesome example in our reply brief, but I think it is appropriate and that is a situation where a parent takes a child to a physician and a physician says your child is exhibiting signs of cancer the treatment for which is the removal of his leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.770" offset="3142991">Under the very liberal definition of liberty that the District Court applied, clearly the consequence is that parental decision is going to be to deprive the child of his liberty again as the District Court has defined it and as the United States noted in its amicus brief it would be unprecedented to argue that the child has a liberty right.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.435" offset="3221672">A right to due process in that situation and in fact no one argues that, there are simply arguing that in this particular case mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.888" offset="3251451">This child has a right to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.144" offset="3260542">No one argues that he would have that right in any other area and we suggest that, that is simply inconsistent with the way constitutional rights have been defined.</text>

            <text syncTime="809.565" offset="3318220">If they are going to be denied a liberty of property interest, you never reach a conclusion that the due process clause is not applicable or something, you can say that what was done did not deprive them of any liberty or property.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.715" offset="3378824">That is correct Sir, but at the point we are and the argument right now, it is our position that a child does not have a liberty right at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.348" offset="3405365">At this point vis-a-vis his parents not vis-a-vis the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.908" offset="3419575">Constitutional rights, I believe you can say do not exist in the abstract they exist because of relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.734" offset="3450818">You might say that there is a constitutional rights when you got the parents or the Child versus State as in the case of Henry Goll, we are talking about the parent and the child and the parent making the decision for the child, we say that there is no liberty interest and that is where the Court should have focused first and did the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.435" offset="3625629">However even if the Court decides that in fact there is a liberty interest here that could be protected, the second question is the one that was advanced by the Court itself and that is why there is, whether or not some State Action involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.194" offset="3672650">Now the best way to address the State Action question from our perceptive is to consider what this Court said Burton versus Wilmington Parking Authority and that is that you have to look at the case and set the facts and circumstances to determine will there be a State Action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.848" offset="3735344">What we can say is that the challenge statute here does not authorize parents to provide medically indicated treatment for their children.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.626" offset="5906433">The point I was making is that they – it is a team approach when they come to the hospital, you have got as I said psychiatrist, psychologists social workers, mental health therapist who the record discloses contacts Schools or community, the courts, the Police to try to get a picture, they talk to the child, they talk to his parents and then they decide to admit it and that is probably our biggest difficulty here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.690" offset="5990651">It just seems that is clearly a rational decision making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.135" offset="6008415">That State has no stage in admitting the child, there is no proof that the child or that the State gets anything if the child is admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.976" offset="6043837">The records clear that we do not operate capacity in our hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.126" offset="6060450">The records is replete with evidence on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.025" offset="6072049">But even if the child is mistakenly hospitalized, even if the child's parents have the wrong motives to bring that child to the hospital, even if the doctors just completely do the wrong thing and admit the child, the child still has access to the Courts and I think that, that ought to be considered, it has not been considered yet.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.417" offset="6685613">They could mandamus him to perhaps examine the child but they could not mandamus him to admit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.832" offset="6703272">There is one issue that I do not want to get away from, I do not want to sit down without addressing it and that is the substantive due process issue because that -- I know I have spent a lot of time when the procedural question -- but that is the nut of this case; that is why this case was brought in the first instance and we think that the District Court's decision there was incorrect and has to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.505" offset="6781953">What the District Court has said us in this substantive due process question, is that if a parent brings a child to a State Mental Hospital and our physician examines that child and he says, “this child is mentally ill, I can treat him in my hospital, I can give him some benefit, but if I had my choice I would give him or I would send him to group home or specialized foster home, then we cannot provide treatment for that child if we do not have that specialized foster home or that group home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.166" offset="6888637">What the District Court has said is that if we are going to provide treatment for these children, we have to provide the treatment in the most appropriate treatment setting and if we do not have it we can not provide the treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.493" offset="6929910">Now the absurdity of this is that if a parent, if an adult rather comes to our hospital, he has got Schizophrenia, paranoid type, even if he is not appropriate for hospitalization in this case they have adult foster homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.521" offset="6998037">Even if he is not appropriate for hospitalization, he can go into that hospital because he has presumed to be able to assume the risk of going into the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.572" offset="7030220">But under the Districts Court's decision, if a child comes to that hospital with that exact same condition, we cannot put that child in the hospital, his parents cannot waive his constitutional rights under the Districts Court's opinion and that child will go without a treatment until that child either degenerates the point where hospitalization is appropriate or until the parent is able to find some private care for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.325" offset="7117260">And it just does not seem to be a logical result to us and it is certainly one that should not be allowed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.556" offset="7146099">It just is a result that should be avoided and I know when our reply brief I accused the I think it is perhaps the wrong word, but I mentioned a parade of horribles and I do not want the Court to think that, that is what I am doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.905" offset="7203569">Any fair reading of that District Court's decision, particularly when coupled with the order denying the stay, makes it absolutely clear that the District Court said I find that every moment of inappropriate hospitalization of a child denies that child a substantive due process interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.833" offset="7271278">Every moment of inappropriate hospitalization and he has found that it was inappropriate when we could think of some other treatment setting that was more appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2040.681" offset="8242615">Dr. Filley testifies that the development of community screening resources are lagging far behind those of adult and finally you have the fact involving J.L. and J.R. both of them were screened by a community screening process and yet and the recommendation of their therapist was, was that they should not be hospitalized and yet that recommendation was not even considered by the admitting physician and I think that those facts go to show how inadequate that community screening process is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.302" offset="8393185">Next we are relying on the fact of the uncertainty of the diagnosis that this Court has noted before in terms of psychiatrist the tentativeness of professional judgment we have expert witnesses who testify to the institutional biases, that are reflected through the decision of institutional psychiatrist and finally the District Court went to these facilities looked at the admissions process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3691.854" offset="14847311">And Mr. Comartie I might just ask one question about what is going to happen next after the case leaves this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.322" offset="14873224">One of the briefs filed by one of the associations suggest Tthat there should be an exemption for intact families pre-adolescent children and for commitments for short periods of time, at least when all those conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.252" offset="14920976">Could that be done consistently with the manner which the case was disposed or belowered does that require.</text>

            <text syncTime="3721.354" offset="14965384">There is a good bit of flexibility in what the Court did because it really did not say this is what is required, X, Y and Z, because the EPA brief agreed that the Georgia procedures were invalid, what they said was, with an intact family for a short period of time for accredited institution for a pre-adolescent child, the balancing maybe different there.</text>
