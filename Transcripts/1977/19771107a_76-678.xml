            <label>Ms. Mary T. Matthies</label>
            <text syncTime="9.886" offset="119476">Thank you Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.237" offset="124910">Mr. Chief Justice and if it pleases the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.374" offset="137448">This case involves the interpretation and application of Section 626 (d) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.397" offset="173497">Section 626 (d)provides that with prior to the institution of a civil action by a private individual under the act, the individual must give 180 days notice to the Secretary of Labor of their intent to sue and then must then afford the Secretary of Labor 60 days in which to conciliate or mediate the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.352" offset="285301">The issues presented here are basically two fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.991" offset="303901">The first issue and we submit that the case could in fact be decided on a narrower ground is whether the Court of Appeals improperly intruded upon the equitable discretion of the district court in overturning the decision by the district court that the relative equities in this case did not warrant a tolling of the 180 day time period set forth in Section 626 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="86.647" offset="426467">The broader grounds is whether Section 626 (d) is a substantive jurisdictional prerequisite to suit or is more analogous to a statute of limitations and if it is more analogous to a statute of limitations and thereby subject to similar toning principles, whether the actions by Mrs. Dart brought this case within one of the recognized tolling principles.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="111.636" offset="526464">And which do you say it is?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mary_t_matthies" startTime="113.889" stopTime="446.163">
            <label>Ms. Mary T. Matthies</label>
            <text syncTime="113.889" offset="535450">Obviously, Your Honor our first contention is that it is a substantive jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.202" offset="560737">We believe that both the clear language of the statute as well as the legislative history indicate a Congressional intent to circumscribe the private right of action and to have the 180 day period not modified, except perhaps in very egregious circumstances certainly not present in the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.043" offset="652061">We believe that the legislative history for instance indicates that the 180 day period was not initially contained in the House Pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.632" offset="706500">The senate included the 180 day requirement and then the house receded to the senate's request for the 180 day requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.867" offset="755401">The 180 day requirement was lobbied extensively for by management in order to circumscribe the right of action of individuals and in order to give we believe the Department of Labor close to exclusive jurisdiction of age discrimination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.628" offset="838470">Employers did not want, we believe the Congressional and legislative history says, employers did not want any private right of action to be maintained, because they could see the possibility of frivolous lawsuits being brought and frivolous lawsuits are of course expensive and it is clear that the employers clearly preferred that there would be a limited right for private action only in the first 180 day period, only if notice to the intent of sue was given in the 180 day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.937" offset="991652">We believe also that clear statutory language which is of course the best evidence of what Congress intended sets forth that such a notice shall be filed within 180 day.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.270" offset="1045047">Mrs. Dartt contends, I believe alternatively, that either her oral complaint to the Department of Labor within the 180-day period satisfied or it tolled the time for her to meet the notice of intent to sue requirement within clearly her oral complaint which she stipulated and included no evidence of suing or of an intent to sue Shell.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.972" offset="1151835">We believe her oral complaint clearly did not satisfy the 180 day notice requirement and that Court of Appeals so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.509" offset="1189974">The Court of Appeals found, however, that the 180 day period was analogous to a statute of limitations, and therefore, could be tolled on certain equitable grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.277" offset="1245040">We believe that even assuming that the Court of Appeals was correct in it is holding that the 180 day time period is analogous to a statute of limitations, it certainly was incorrect in finding that based upon substantial precedents by this Court that this case is or that the situation here warranted a tolling of that time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.371" offset="1341380">To recognize equitable grounds for tolling of 180 day requirement or a statute of limitations requirement, that the defendant has acted in some way to mislead or prevent the plaintiff from acting, that the plaintiff was acting under some kind of recognized legal disability or that the plaintiff was prevented by operation of law from acting to preserve their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.158" offset="1452557">We believe the fact situation here establishes and the record so shows that all Mrs. Dartt did was she called an attorney, preliminarily after she felt that she had been discharged because of her age, the attorney did not tell her of the notice requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.107" offset="1516400">The attorney told her to go to the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.667" offset="1526640">She went to the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.640" offset="1534477">The Department of Labor treated her complaint as being a complaint which could activate the administrative investigative mechanisms, did not, the Department of Labor stated that it did not consider her oral complaint to be notice of intent to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.565" offset="1594141">In fact, it advised Shell that no notice of intent to sue had been filed and then proceeded to process a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.068" offset="1632175">We do not believe that these circumstances indicate Mrs. Dartt and I am stepping back just a moment, Mrs. Dartt also stated that when she went to the Department of Labor, she sat down.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.685" offset="1686719">I believe, I thought well, as theDepartment of Labor would handle it then why bother with an attorney, why bother with the expensive attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.387" offset="1721514">She was asked in the district court whether she made any inquiry as what was necessary to preserve her rights, if she had inquired it any time from the Department of Labor as to what she needed to do and her answer was no that she did not, that she went to them and she thought they would take care of everything, and therefore, she had properly relied upon them to advise her of 180 day notice of intent to sue requirement which the Department of Labor did not do, but which the Court of Appeals found they had statutory obligation to do.</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary T. Matthies</label>
            <text syncTime="491.800" offset="2047104">We knew that she had filed in or registered an oral complaint with the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.458" offset="2069778">The Department of Labor had told Shell that she had not filed any notice of intent to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.160" offset="2096528">So we knew that theDepartment of Labor had her complaint before it, that they were in the process of investigating her complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.090" offset="2124322">It was in Shell's position that a complaint had absolutely no matter whatsoever and we fully believed that the Department of Labor upon a complete investigation would so find and we would be without any suit whatsoever, because we were in the posture where we had no notice of intent to sue, we were not given the opportunity within the time which Congress established to take a close look at the possibility that she was going to sue us, and therefore, look at settlement in light of nuisance lawsuit value, which may still have been to her benefit in light of possibly increased litigation expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.739" offset="2294849">I think that anybody who has been in practice knows that when they are dealing with a client, the client is pinched when a claim is initiated, say for instance a contract claim someone writes and says you owe me such and such and so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.489" offset="2365902">That they are not as inclined to settle that case as they are when they get a clearcut notice through the attorney calling the, the attorney for the opposing side calling the attorney for the client or through some other means where they get clear cut notice that they are going to be sued if they do not accept.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.751" offset="2526921">I concede Your Honor that in certain rather egregious situations, for instance, I think if Mrs. Dartt had been able to show that Shell had immediately upon discharging her, hurried her off and locked her up in a Mexican jail for six months and thereby she had been enable to fulfill her notice of intent to to sue requirement and we did this knowing full though that we were prohibiting her from doing that, that fundamental principles of justice would certainly, I think hold that no one can profit from and they are wrong, and therefore, the time limits could be modified in that situation, although I am not really sure in that sort of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.677" offset="2694627">It would even be a tolling so much as it would be an adjustment of the equities.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.757" offset="2718973">Well, do not you really have three alternatives here rather than to the first being the type of limitation applies from your filing a notice of appeal from the district court to the Court of Appeals, that there just virtually are no exceptions for?</text>
            <text syncTime="675.560" offset="2782190">Then the second being the statute of limitations type of thing that as my brother Blackmun suggests, there might well be tolling situations that are fairly well established by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.522" offset="2837987">And the third being a sort of principle of latches which would be a good deal losing and where if the defendant could not show any prejudice you might permit them to proceed without any great showing of equitable tolling principles on their side?</text>

          <turn speaker="mary_t_matthies" startTime="705.677" stopTime="1225.202">
            <label>Ms. Mary T. Matthies</label>
            <text syncTime="705.677" offset="2902666">I think that yes Your Honor there would certainly be those three possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.290" offset="2921057">I believe that the plaintiff in fact argued in the district court, although did not continue to press that in the Court of Appeals to my recollection, that the 180 day requirement was in fact what I believe they termed as directory rather than the mandatory and that would fall into I suppose what you call the third classification of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.135" offset="3004439">I do not really think that we can -- that this time limitation, the 180 day time limitation would fall into the third category of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.437" offset="3045713">I think the close analogy perhaps of the 180 day requirement here to the 180 day requirement under Title VII indicates that it is in fact a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.708" offset="3106735">The wording of the statute itself indicates that the filing of the notice for intent to sue within the 180 day period is in fact a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.389" offset="3149471">I note in the senate report on the new possible amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that the senate when they deleted the 180 day requirement from the notice of intent to sue provision stated that they were deleting the requirement of a notice of intent to sue, which I think kind of tends to indicate that the senate -- that the 180 day requirement was a substantial requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.822" offset="3263261">And the legislative history itself indicates that the senate considered it to be a substantial requirement when the house deleted the 180 day requirement when the senate passed bill and the senate put it right back in saying we want there to be a 180 day limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.072" offset="3332224">So if we were to take the position here that we were going to allow any kind of tolling, for instance is the 180 day requirement, I think what we get into Your Honor is adapting on approach that the house and the senate ended up specifically rejecting, because the house bill had provided for the allowance of a filling of a notice for intent to sue any time within the statute of limitations period, the two year statue to limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.437" offset="3465657">And the senate said no, we want a notice of intent to suit filed within a 180 days and I think that that indicates very clearly that the Congress considered it to be a substantial requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.436" offset="3517693">So turning back to the decisions by or the decision by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.299" offset="3553115">Although the Court of Appeals did not specifically saying so, the Court of Appeals I believe followed what could be characterized as an extension of the tolling principles annunciated by this Court in Burnett v. the New York Central Railroad Company and the rationale behind the tolling allowed by the Tenth Circuit was that in this particular situation they felt that the de facto purposes, the filling of the or the registering of the oral complaint and a subsequent isolated settlement inquiry by the Department of Labor fulfilled the notice and conciliation functions of Section 626 (d), and therefore, there was no particular reason in this situation to not toll the 180 day time limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.329" offset="3797203">We do not believe that Burnett is controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.129" offset="3808488">We believe that the rationale of Burnett applies to a very, very limited situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.571" offset="3838163">In the first place, Burnett dealt with an ordinary statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.586" offset="3862301">The Burnett facts were significantly different from the facts present in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.648" offset="3890513">In Burnett, the defendant received all of the notice contemplated by the statute and otherwise valid complaint was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.059" offset="3928129">There was no defect in process or in service of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.792" offset="3943071">The only defect was in venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.732" offset="3962820">The fact that there was only a defect in venue was deemed important because Congress had number one, expressed a desire for uniform time limitations by enacting the statute of limitations provisions in Philiff (ph) and to not allow tolling would have caused a substantial non uniformity in time limitations because many states as well as the federal government had savings or venue transfer provisions and that had, if the plaintiff resided in any other part of the country then where he did, in Burnett, there was a good possibility that his cause of action would have been safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.439" offset="4149648">And this Court looking at the fact that there was only a defect in venue and the fact that the Congress had indicated its desire for uniform time limitations in Philiff (ph) and also noting that the Congress had indicated a desire for saving improperly venued actions by allowing transfer, having enacted a statute to that precise effect, this court decided that there should be a tolling in Burnett.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.855" offset="4263332">It is also significant in Burnett that the plaintiff would have lost all means of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.621" offset="4290395">It is also significant in Burnett that the defendant could have waived according to this Court the defect in venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.672" offset="4322578">If in fact that the Section in 626 (d) requirement is jurisdictional as we can contend then it is clear and I think the decisions of this Courts have so held that a party cannot waive a jurisdictional defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.307" offset="4385168">It cannot be waived even with consent of the parties, whereas the defect of venue in Burnett could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.738" offset="4410872">There was also and I think this is probably one of the most important differences, there was a fixed time period in Burnett to which the tolling would apply so that you had clearcut periods from the time of the institution of the action to the time when the action was dismissed where you could say yes a tolling in fact occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.959" offset="4507734">I do not believe and I think this would be an interesting question to ask a person, I do not believe that there is any triggering period where you can say that the statute was tolled here and then starts again here, if you allow tolling for oral complaints.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.191" offset="5480743">On the other hand, the Department of Labor is required to investigate and to weed out frivolous suits and then to bring suit itself within, also within that two-year limitation period and the fact that there is two-year limitation period in addition to the 180 day requirement, I think indicates that the 180 day requirement is there for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.577" offset="5590248">And we submit that the reason that the 180 day requirement is there is precisely to have the effect we just had here which is to weed out the complaints of individuals who do not act within a timely manner to assert their right to file a suit by filing a notice of an intent to sue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1440.799" offset="5843114">No, I do submit that it is a mandatory requirement and I think we ought to analogize that requirement in fact to Title VII standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.340" offset="5893269">Under Title VII if a charging body does not file a charge with the ESE within a 180 days, their right to sue is lost entirely and this Court has held that that particular period which is over and above the two-year limitation on back hand to Title VII is in fact a jurisdictional prerequisite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.611" offset="5986369">And I point out that the effects on a Title VII plaintiff of applying the 180 day charging requirement as a jurisdictional prerequisite are much more severe than they are here, because here Mrs. Dartt still had a remedy expressly approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.678" offset="6078634">She had instituted a complaint with the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.672" offset="6090650">The Department of Labor could in fact act on her complaint and could in fact sue on her behalf if it were so inclined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.610" offset="6118340">So the strict application of the time limitation in this particular situation is much less harsh in operation than it is to strictly apply it in the case of Title VII plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.190" offset="6300675">Obviously statute of limitations are arbitrary and they are established to cut off rights justifiably or not, but I think that that real purpose of the 180 day requirement is in fact to let the employer know that it is going to be sued, because we all know that if you know that you are going to be sued, you are more inclined to go about settling the case in a speedy fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.964" offset="6395760">It also acts as a trigger to the Department of Labor, to let the Department of Labor know which cases it has in its office, it needs to devote concerted conciliation activities to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.684" offset="6454692">For instance in this case, when Mrs. Dartt registered her oral complaint, the department of labor just kind of put the case in its normal processing and to look at it and never asked Shell, even made its preliminarily cursory inquiry as to whether Shell was interested in settling until some 80 or better days after the complaint had been registered with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.472" offset="6541837">So the Department of Labor is I would as equally prejudiced as both the plaintiff and the employer are when the notice for intent to sue is not given.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.639" offset="6670464">All of the same I do believe that the Department of Labor in its administration of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act certainly needs to know when it is supposed to exert exhaustive conciliation efforts and when it is not supposed to exert exhaustive conciliation efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.158" offset="6748518">Normally, the Department of Labor will not exert exhaustive conciliation efforts until after they have decided there is merit to the charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.006" offset="6879966">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.711" offset="6902745">When Congress passed the Age Discrimination Act in 1967, they had at that time, a benefit of observing the machinery of Title VII for some three years that was passed in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.147" offset="6972544">They found that there had been a great deal of delay in Title VII procedures in that a person would file a charge which was required to be in writing and under oath incidentally and then the EEOC would began investigating that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.296" offset="7061151">It would be months and months and sometimes years before they ever got their notice or their right to sue letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.502" offset="7097932">When Congress was considering that and rather than amending the 1964 Act, which they could have done very easily to cover age discrimination, they chose instead to fit it into the machinery of the Fair Labor Standards Act, put it under the jurisdiction of the Labor Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.552" offset="7190092">Now, the 60 day limitation that is a 60 day notice of intent to sue was of course put in there to trigger conciliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.526" offset="7242023">That the Congress was very heavy on conciliation because there are a great many of these cases filed, the Labor Department certainly cannot bring lawsuits on all of them and it was the intent of the Congress as shown by the records of the hearings that they certainly wanted conciliation, but further than that the 60 day notice gives a claimant a right to give that 60 day notice and then get on with his law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.820" offset="7363231">He does not have to sit there and wait for months to wait and get this Right to Sue letter from the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.696" offset="7406699">Now, the 180 day limitation I think was placed in there for the same reason, to speed up the procedure, simply to speed up the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.305" offset="7445151">The Congress I think showed that they wanted conciliation procedures to begin and begin speedily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.608" offset="7490395">So the 180 days limitation was placed in there for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.726" offset="7514846">There is nothing in the legislative history that indicates that the Congress intended the 180 day limitation to be jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.812" offset="7567195">In fact, the latest pronouncement by Senator Williams who is the Floor Manager for the Senate Passed Bill, which is now in the House Conference Committee, stated very clearly that it has never been our intent that the 180 day notice period be considered a jurisdictional requisite.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.270" offset="10437008">It is interesting to note that the Labor Department charged with the administration of this Act had since its passage in 1967, taken the position that this was non jurisdictional and Mr. Spear testified that only hearing in District Court and as this Court has previously said in the Griggs and Duke Power Co. case, the administration's interpretation of an Act is entitled to great difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.698" offset="10662706">She filed her complaint nine days after they told her that she did not have any potential because of her age and she made repeated calls to the Labor Department and asked them what is going on my law suit and to get some sort of assurance from Mr. Spear and she did what the Labor Department poster said and incidentally it did not have one word on it about any notice of intent to sue, it says if you think that you have separate discrimination go to the local Wage and Hour office of the Labor Department which is exactly what she did.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.838" offset="12035283">I may proceed with the discussion of the Electrical Workers case, there you had two separate and distinct remedies and the claimant had attempted to proceed under the agreement procedure, whereas the Court said that that would not afford the notice to the defendant that as the proceedings under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.233" offset="12136848">Likewise in Johnson v. Railway Express, you had two separate distinct statutory remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.734" offset="12166836">One under Title VII, one under Section 1981, but in this case the plaintiff is proceeding under one statute, there is one remedy, one cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.565" offset="12218141">It is whether the Labor Department brings the action or whether the plaintiff brings the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.441" offset="12241651">So and since the defendant had notice, the purposes of the Act was served in all respects, we believe and we think that as the Tenth Circuit held that there was de facto fulfillment and that plaintiff should prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.793" offset="12399117">There were several questions which were presented to Mr. Greer that I believe warrant some further discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.621" offset="12438405">I believe Mr. Justice Stevens asked that if there was any evidence of fraudulent concealment in this particular case and Mr. Greer responded that I guess the fraudulent concealment with the supposed of dragging of the feet by Shell with respect to furnishing information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.664" offset="12522624">First place I do not think that mere dragging of one's feet would amount to fraudulent concealment under any cases that I know dealing with fraudulent concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.776" offset="12567032">In the second place it is simply not in the evidence in the record that Shell was dragging its feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.369" offset="12585422">There were no statements made by Mr. Spear the Wage and Hour investigator stating that he thought that the delay was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.804" offset="12627114">As a matter of fact if I believe this, the statements to that effect by the Court of Appeals were no more than sheer speculation as to the reasons for the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.186" offset="12676642">Shell on the hand presented evidence showing that the reasons for the delay was they put large amount of data which the Department of Labor wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.482" offset="12709870">Of course if the Department of Labor had thought that the delay was unreasonable, the Department of Labor could have subpoenaed the data, which it did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.513" offset="12741948">As a matter of fact there is no indication in the record that the Department of Labor even contacted Shell but tweaks the time that it requested the data and Shell called the Department some two-and-a-half months later to say we are working on it and we are almost through and we just wanted to let you know where we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.506" offset="12809971">I am not sure that there is any evidence in record that would establish fraudulent concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.164" offset="12844557">Mr. Justice Stevens, also I believe asked, whether there is any precedent for tolling where the government fails to advice a plaintiff of its rights and I believe Mr Greer responded that he thought that Love v. Pullman applied to this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.226" offset="12916864">I question Love v. Pullman's applicability. In first place in Love v. Pullman, there was at issue whether or not the actions of the government fulfilled the purposes of Title VII and it appeared that there was wrongful advice in fact given with respect to what needed to be done as opposed to here which was simply an omission, which Mrs. Dartt we believe could surely have corrected herself, had she made just a minimal increase, do I have to wait, look guys handling this thing any longer, or is there something else I can do, do I have any other rights, what should I do, where should I go, how do I proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.992" offset="13103901">Mrs. Dartt did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.007" offset="13115917">I believe that the Mr Greer also stated that Mrs. Dartt followed everything that that ADEA poster required her to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.404" offset="13181537">In other words, she went to the Department of Labor and that is what the ADEA posters state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.464" offset="13201808">I do not know how the ADEA posters difference, had it in fact included some kind of provision with respect to that would it help Mrs. Dartt because she testified before the lower court that she in fact did not see the poster and she never thought it was in fact up and so we do not believe that there is any evidence based on sheerly upon the alleged inadequacy as a poster for I told in here.</text>
