            <text syncTime="11.387" offset="125449">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.507" offset="137988">When we closed yesterday Justice Rehnquist had questioned whether fee awards against sometimes indigent, Title VII plaintiffs would really deter enforcement, and some Title VII plaintiffs are undoubtedly indigent and perhaps judgment proof, many more are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.554" offset="194203">Title VII claims are brought not only by incumbents and unsuccessful applicants and not only by blue collar workers, but by executives.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.337" offset="241328">We think that the thread of fee awards against their personal property, however, modest would be a substantial deterrent, and more importantly Congress throught that it had this deterrent effect because Congress authorized fee awards was to deter frivolous, or abusive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.478" offset="313844">This is also the same basis that this Court has used to uphold the American Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.927" offset="335683">This Court set in Fleishman that if plaintiffs were forced to paying not only their own fees, but the fees of their opponents when the lost, the poor might be unjustly discouraged from bringing actions to vindicate their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.844" offset="391271">We think this is not in abstract concern, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, the NAACP based upon their experience and their briefs, they conclude that in ordinary award of attorney's fees against unsuccessful defendants would have the substantial adverse effect upon Title VII enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.504" offset="481968">This is surely inconsistent with Newman and we do not think it is impossible -- we think it is impossible but Congress could have intended that.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.392" offset="521465">Especially since Congress was concerned that these plaintiffs would be unable to pay their own fees and that is why they passed the statute, Senator Humphrey said, "The purpose of the statute is to help poor plaintiffs bring meritorious litigation."</text>

            <text syncTime="126.062" offset="584159">Could a District Court, in exercise of its discretion, consider the fact that the prevailing defendant was said charitable corporation, nonprofit corporation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_s_martin" startTime="139.696" stopTime="188.903">
            <label>Mr. Thomas S. Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="139.696" offset="638703">I think the District Court could consider that.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.529" offset="654063">The District Court has a grant of discretion, it is a wide grant, and the courts have considered those kinds of factors in the cases where the good faith standard has been implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.627" offset="698471">I do not think it is a straightjacket for a District Court consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.763" offset="711010">They would also have to consider it though Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.037" offset="724071">The status of the plaintiff and the facts of the plaintiff for example might be the EEOC which has an obligation to advance Title VII law might be a poor plaintiff, and it has to consider the fact that awarding an attorney's fee might deter future Title VII litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.580" offset="790213">So it has discretion and it can consider that factor, but it has to consider within the whole scope of the purpose of Title VII to eliminate discriminations, country and employment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="188.903" stopTime="201.705">
            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="188.903" offset="835562">In your view, could the District Court also consider the size and financial condition of many of these defendants are quite small almost nonemployed businesses?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_s_martin" startTime="201.705" stopTime="284.328">
            <label>Mr. Thomas S. Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="201.705" offset="886762">I think that District Court could consider that Mr. Justice Powell, but it should also consider these factors that before Congress was an amendment to eliminate fee awards against small businesses that was in 1972 and it is set forth in our brief and Congress rejected that amendment before Congress would many amendments to eliminate the coverage of Title VII from small businesses, and nevertheless, Congress refused to withdraw Title VII coverage from small businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.231" offset="1004835">If we had a course of dealing, in which District Courts consistently refused to award fees in cases brought against small businesses, it might effectively insulate those small businesses from Title VII coverage and therefore reverse the two decisions made by the Congress - one to cover them; and two, not to allow mandatory fees in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.303" offset="1113191">And let me also mention that in this case, Christiansburg was a company in 1970 which had 230 employees, and that was almost ten times that minimal amount that was needed for a Title VII coverage, so it would not be dispositive in this case regardless.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.616" offset="1190409">In answer to your questions I think the District Court has discretion to consider these factors, but it has to measure all this against Title VII's purposes.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="284.328" offset="1217263">Mr. Martin, your answer somewhat confuses me.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.346" offset="1229279">I thought it was your position that a District Court should exercise its discretion to impose attorney's fees upon plaintiffs only upon a finding that the action had been brought in bad faith or vexatiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.273" offset="1289047">And I should think the identity of the defendant would have nothing whatsoever to do with that criteria.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Thomas S. Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="305.831" offset="1303258">Well, the indicia associated with the fee award or bad faith, vexatiousness etc.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.858" offset="1331366">So I think in normal case, as a normal rule, fee should not be awarded in absent those indicia.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.949" offset="1367728">What the Congress meant to preclude the Court from even considering the fact that in exercise of its discretionary grant that the employer was a small employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.484" offset="1421854">It does not appear from the legislative history except to the extent that Congress decided to cover those employers and rejected amendments that would have given the mandatory awards.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.147" offset="1572528">All I am suggesting is that the rule seems to be in the nature of a guideline at least as articulated by the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.115" offset="1608368">The Courts of Appeals have not articulated whether in fact the consideration in which Mr. Justice Powell suggests, should be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.227" offset="1640865">They have not said it should be excluded and therefore I do not think to affirm this case which just says that the indicia associated with the award of bad faith and vexatiousness, we need it necessarily to deal with that problem whether that is a --</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.055" offset="4972208">We have the same use of similar language in other statutes by Congress, all those indicate as we think point in the same direction and that is that the Court and that the Congress intended when it used this language to set up one rule for prevailing plaintiffs and the good faith rule for prevailing defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.294" offset="5037096">That is our best estimate of what Congress intended based upon all these legislative indicators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.369" offset="5061443">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. William W. Sturges</label>
            <text syncTime="1251.194" offset="5084744">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.556" offset="5094148">I do, a few remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.799" offset="5107105">First of all, in respect to considering the financial ability of the loser to pay, we think that is a matter that a District Court can properly consider, and if the plaintiff is judgment proof or if the defendant is judgment proof, certainly in that kind of a case the Court should exercise its discretion not to award attorney's fees to the winning party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.060" offset="5244195">In respect to the question asked by Mr. Justice Powell in respect to a nonprofit corporation, that is a matter again we would submit in the District Court's jurisdiction and discretion and undoubtedly a variety of facts would have to be taken into consideration as to whether an award should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.431" offset="5369687">Secondly, the law as it existed, before Title VII or the 1964 Act was passed, provided attorney's fees to a party if that party was subjected to a vexatious or bad faith suit or defense.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1347.676" offset="5470625">That was in the absence of any legislation qualify.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_w_sturges" startTime="1351.420" stopTime="1521.083">
            <label>Mr. William W. Sturges</label>
            <text syncTime="1351.420" offset="5485671">That was in the absence of any legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.609" offset="5494344">Yes, Your Honor that was the inherent equitable power of the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.646" offset="5522556">Now, there are some 40 or 50 statutes that the Congress has passed in respect to attorney's fees and they provide attorney's fees in a variety of cases - sometimes to the prevailing party, sometimes to the injured party, sometimes to the prevailing plaintiff, sometimes in exceptional cases, sometimes otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.555" offset="5638122">We submit that there is no holding by this Court or by any court that when Congress passes a statute allowing attorney's fees to the prevailing party, that if the either party had acted in bad faith they would have been precluded from receiving attorney's fees absent a provision in the statute which would allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.062" offset="5780228">Indeed this Court in Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises in its Footnote 4 stated, "If Congress' objective had been to authorize the assessment of attorney's fees against defendants who made completely groundless contention for purposes of delay, no new statutory provision would have been necessary."</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.477" offset="5877821">For it has long been held that a Federal Court may award counsel fees to a successful plaintiff where a defense has been maintained "in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.090" offset="5948352">And the Court again adopted this same language in its Alyeska Pipeline Service Company case, in which it said the Court, in referring to the same footnote in Newman where it stated, the Court reasoned that if Congress had intended to authorize fees only on the basis of bad faith, no new legislation would have been required in view of the history of the bad faith exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.838" offset="6063291">So we say to the Court and argued that it was not necessary for the Congress to pass all the statute allowing, including prevailing parties in the statute in order to award attorney's fees for bad faith either to the plaintiff, or the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1521.083" offset="6164228">Mr. Sturges can I interrupt, for just a moment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.641" offset="6174468">I was reflecting on your argument last time and you said that your position now is that the same rule should apply to both sides whether the plaintiff or the defendant prevails, is that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. William W. Sturges</label>
            <text syncTime="1532.561" offset="6210203">That is correct Mr. Justice.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="1533.371" offset="6213443">Now, does that mean that which of two positions do you therefore take that the rule of Piggie Park has been changed for successful plaintiffs or that whenever a defendant wins, the defendant should routinely give fees from the plaintiff?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_w_sturges" startTime="1546.824" stopTime="1553.663">
            <label>Mr. William W. Sturges</label>
            <text syncTime="1546.824" offset="6267255">Are you saying that the rule annunciated in Piggie Park should apply to defendants as well as the plaintiffs?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="1553.663" stopTime="1559.837">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="1553.663" offset="6294631">So that in the normal case if the defendant wins, he automatically gets fees unless there is some exceptional reason for denying a fee.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_w_sturges" startTime="1559.837" stopTime="1648.160">
            <label>Mr. William W. Sturges</label>
            <text syncTime="1559.837" offset="6319291">That is our position Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.889" offset="6331516">Now, in respect to public policy in the Newman case this Court analogized the successful plaintiff, as carrying the burden of a private Attorney General -- and that was based in part on the statutory history, what little areas to in encourage such litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.608" offset="6450425">As we have pointed out that statutory history also discourages unmeritorious litigation and we would submit to the Court, the analogy that the successful plaintiff, if you will, is similar to the private defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.814" offset="6539242">Lastly we would suggest to the Court that the legislative history of the 1976 Attorney's Fees Act is, in no way, irrelevant to what the Congress in 1964 intended in respect to the provision under consideration here and we submit I believe it is Footnote 36 in the Teamster v. Time (ph) case as a further support for that position.</text>
