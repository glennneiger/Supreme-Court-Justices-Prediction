            <text syncTime="58.081" offset="312260">The question presented by this case is whether is a complaint alleging that State prison officials negligently lost 13 items of a prisoner's outgoing mail in 1971 and 1972, states a cause of action under 42 U.S.C., Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.422" offset="409644">On January 4th, 1974, respondent Navarette, with his present counsel, filed a second amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, solely for damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.127" offset="520403">In his first and second causes of action, he alleged that the defendant deliberately refused to send this letters, either one, in knowing disregard or two in bad faith disregard of prisoner's First Amendment Right of free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.732" offset="590830">These causes of actions are not before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.218" offset="680795">There is a suggestion in respondent's brief in this Court that the claim of mail loss involved or resulted in a denial of access to the Courts as well as the denial of free expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.893" offset="7763532">In dealing first with deterrence, that this Court carefully explored the question of the extent to which compensation should be provided and the extent to which immunity should be allowed to state officials in relation to conducts involving the exercise of discretion and in the cases of Scheuer v. Rhodes and Wood v. Strickland that I am sure Your Honors are extremely familiar with, that balance was struck with a certain degree of deference given to the importance of state officials engaging in decisive action and in acknowledgment that the public interest called for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.252" offset="7976900">Now, what we may well have here on the part of those officials who were exercising discretion in relation to the regulation of prisoner mail, is a failure to act, an abdication from the exercise of any discretion of whatsoever, a failure to look at the options.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.755" offset="8066970">And if petitioners' request is honored by this Court and if the opportunity to obtain money liability against such state officials as those is the effect of result of a determination by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.810" offset="12415208">There are few other points that I would like briefly advert to that arose in the questions of the petitioning attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.365" offset="12457422">First of all briefly in relation to the right of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.944" offset="12475708">I would say at length on footnote 2, page 3 of my brief, why I -- I now press it even though indeed I did not, now in much respect and advisably concede the right of access in written argument, both before the District Court and Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.206" offset="12544776">I, in terms of the coverage, the constitutional coverage of the conduct here involved, the sending and receiving of -- well, the sending of mail, the First Amendment free expression as I see it is completely coterminous with the right of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.675" offset="12626591">The distinction then, the materiality of the right of access has to do only with the history of the development of these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.424" offset="12657625">The right of exercise is an older right and has a longer history to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.013" offset="12679986">The distinction in my view became more material, when Wood v. Strickland was decided because I talked about settled constitutional rights and I think there is a -- well there is -- if this Court were to take petitioner's view that only in a -- only a decision by this Court itself were to establish a right to be settled within the meaning Wood v. Strickland then obviously I am out in cold as far as free expression goes because although as I have argued in my brief there were some District Court decisions, that in my view reasonably and very clearly let defendant Procunier know he being party in a couple of those suits and as well as some of the other defendants know, that there was prisoner free expression already, reasonably and advance in 1971-72.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.117" offset="12916446">There is no decision by this Court until Martinez V. Procunier where there was the beginning of that acknowledgment of that right and then Payne V. Procunier was shortly thereafter where it was made express.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.986" offset="12959914">Indeed prisoners have a certain measure of First Amendment for the expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.349" offset="12989275">In terms of right of access, Johnson v. Avery was decided much earlier and that would have -- could have been a foundation for at least that rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.895" offset="13031489">So indeed candidly I made the our concession before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.978" offset="13067852">If the Court wants to deal with the question of -- that I think really is not properly before this Court, there is a matter of the question on which cert was granted, but if the Court should wish to deal what with it, I would suggest that it might in the interest of making a decision that gives good guidance to the Circuit Courts and the Lower Federal Courts will be reading this decision to look at all the rights -- the facts fairly raised and I think that the facts, do fairly raise right of access as well as free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.684" offset="13238692">There is another question that maybe in the minds of this Court, in relation to the allowing of negligence that I would like to address myself to briefly and that is whether the relief that might be available in State Court, is it really sufficient for the kind of harm that we are speaking of here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.694" offset="13330748">And I would suggest to Your Honors that is really not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.822" offset="13343182">That we need a Federal Forum, the Forum of 1983 and a federal perspective in order to properly grant a compensatory relief because we are talking about different interest, not just common law interest, injury to person, injury to property, we are talking about constitutional interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.413" offset="13405563">And as Justice Harlin said very eloquently in his concurring opinion in Roe v. Pape, those interests are fundamentally different in character and often would call for different measure of damages in order to provide compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.984" offset="13475884">For example in the Troy v. Dallas case, 356 U.S. involving a decision by this Court that Eighth Amendment was violated by the denationalization of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.188" offset="13532727">There is no physical mistreatment, but yet that the total destruction of the individual's status in an organized society violated that constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.779" offset="13571075">There would have been no damages in Common Law and what about the right of an individual to vote or to attend an integrated school, what is?</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.878" offset="13599391">the Common Law on money damages there, and what about Mr. Navarette right here, Common Law perspective handful of mail what is at work?</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.299" offset="13633141">But when we look at it from a constitutional perspective, we are talking about this man's effort to communicate with the world outside and that has a certain value in terms of rehabilitation of this man.</text>

            <text syncTime="3542.530" offset="14250049">I am reading from the appendix to the petition for certiorari at page 7, and then on page 8 it goes on to say the allegations that state officers negligently deprived him of those rights referring to the First Amendment Rights, states a 1083 cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.352" offset="14309295">We filed our writ from that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.487" offset="14325909">Now, the Ninth Circuit construed the third cause of action to state a clause of action in negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.256" offset="14352972">If this Court or majority of this Court reads it as stating some other cause of action as habitual misreading of statute and regulations reads to us deliberate in difference and he does not need a negligence cause of action and the Ninth Circuit in so far as it has held that negligence states the cause of action was misreading what this complaint was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.341" offset="14449311">But the Court, I think should go further and unequivocally hold that if it does indeed allege negligence because he must mean negligence here, he said deliberate in difference in his first two causes of action, then we decide that under no circumstances does negligence state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.988" offset="14527888">And I think that this Court's decisions, particularly in Estelle v. Gamble, Paul v. Davis, Rizzo v. Goode, support the proposition that negligence does not state a cause of action under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.312" offset="14593194">The pattern of error by subordinate officials has to be something more than negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3650.154" offset="14680547">Now, I want to clear up the point that whether there are 13 items or 25 items that Justice Powell raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.278" offset="14725060">The complaint lists 13 items have mailed Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.773" offset="14743032">It is true that some of those were apparently have a multiple addressees and I think one of the items was reproduced eight times and put in eight different envelops and sent and when it was turned in there were a package of eight alleged, but that is one item of eight, so if you add up the multiples it comes up to 25 letters in respondent's departments, but we accept his listing of 13 items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.726" offset="14854836">There were 13 letters as we see it, some of them had multiple copies, to clear that up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.078" offset="14884198">Now, I have a fairness question that I have difficulty in dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.356" offset="14909380">The counsel seems say that Mr. Procunier, the Director of the California Department of Corrections should have known about the inmates' First Amendment Right of free expression back in 1971 and 72 because he was in Court, the Lower Courts, District Court and Circuit Court litigating the question but Mr. Procunier was here on 1974 and this Court did not tell him anything about the inmates' right of free expression and I have a -- there is a basic unfairness and telling him now you should have known it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.013" offset="15036021">In 1972, when he was not told about it in 1974, and I had submitted on that.</text>
