            <text syncTime="11.018" offset="123982">Mr. Chief Justice and May I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.456" offset="141745">The question presented in this appeal is whether the remission of the Japanese commodity tax which is imposed on certain consumer electronics products only if they are sold on Japan is a bounty or grant with in the meaning of the Tariff Act of 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.750" offset="226905">When the Congress required the imposition of a countervailing duty in addition to any duties otherwise imposed whenever a bounty or grant was payed or bestowed upon the manufacture or production or export of an article imported into Unite States, it did not define the words bounty or a grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.749" offset="318960">And it then became the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury not only to compute the net amount of a countervailing duty that might be due, but also and initially to determine whether the triggering event, the bounty had occurred. Since a variety of government activities could properly be regarded as bestowing the a bounty or grant, for example a favorable property tax rate or perhaps the exemption from a property tax all together, the Secretary required some guidance in defining this words.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.745" offset="494921">As we have set forth on pages 19 to 24 of our brief, the secretary was not without direction from the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.116" offset="532433">In the evolution of statutory language and in the explanation of the Congressional debates, it became evidence the Congress did not regard the non excessive remission of an excise tax as bounty or grant and we define non excessive to mean a forgiveness of the tax not in excess of what was actually paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.893" offset="643505">In that portion of our brief we point out that as early as 1890 in the sugar tariff, we find the earliest use of the word bounty in the context of the encouragement of an export.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.795" offset="703169">The record on debate indicates what Congress understood then by its use bounty and this was the remission or drawback of indirect taxes exceeding the taxes the exporters had paid on the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.577" offset="770252">By leave of Court, I would like to read one sentence from the remarks of the Senator Gibson in the Congressional debate on that Act and this is found at page 21 of the government's brief and Senator Gibson after giving an example said, “But upon the export of a ton of sugar he receive back as a drawback $117.60 making a clear bounty of $20.54 per gross ton of sugar imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.898" offset="919568">This follows the statement that only $97.06 per gross ton was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.034" offset="944123">So it’s clear from that example that it was the $20.54 excess over the tax paid by the exporter that was regarded as a bounty.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.491" offset="997935">General McCree do you not think that the words directly or indirectly in the statue that we are presently dealing might expend that view of the word bounty?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.393" offset="1045478">They might be so regarded except in 1890, in the first Sugar Act, the language was used directly or indirectly was also employed at the time Senator Gibson gave us this as example which would indicate that it was understood then just to indicate the excessive remission.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.294" offset="1133145">It was not added subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.726" offset="1142862">On page 20 of our brief we set forth about half way the-down the page, the language of the 1890 statue and in the 2nd or 3rd line from the bottom of the coded language, we show that directly or indirectly it was found initially when bounty was first employed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="287.823" offset="1231261">Mr. Solicitor General does the word drawback have, is that term of archive sounds it is familiar to me?</text>

            <label>Mr. Wade H. Mccree</label>
            <text syncTime="294.200" offset="1256756">It was my first acquaintance with it too if the Court please and it is used as I understand it, synonymously with, it means a pay back, a remission, maybe an exemption from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.825" offset="1311195">A drawback is a return of the amount paid and it has been used consistently to mean a non excessive drawback unless it indicates otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.958" offset="1359783">After that first Sugar Tariff Act in 1890, in 1894 as we point out on pages 21 and 22 of our brief, a proviso was added to the Sugar Tariff that makes clear that a non excessive remission does not require a countervailing duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.708" offset="1438777">That proviso was found at the bottom of page 21 and it provides that the importer of sugar produced in the foreign country, the government of which grants such direct or indirect bounty maybe relieved from this additional duty which was a countervailing duty, in case said importer produces a certificate of said government that no indirect bounty has been received upon such sugar in excessive of the tax collected upon the beet or cane from which it was produced and there again we have the guidance that the Secretary found in the early statuary history of countervailing duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.485" offset="1617873">Finally, in this brief excursion into the statutory history, in 1897 we find that the statute was revised and made applicable to all imported products and not just sugar and there the proviso was deleted, but we find the addition of language which we believe for the reasons I will state to be a substitute for the proviso and that language is that there should be levied that paid an additional duty equal to the net amount of such bounty or grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.080" offset="1772309">And we believe that the use of net amount means the amount in excess of the tax otherwise paid and this would appear to be the intention from the floor debate that we set forth on page 22 and 23 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.107" offset="1860394">And if this legislative of history then is proper guidance, the Secretary has indeed followed it consistently in his application and interpretation of the statue for 80 years, during which time as my brother pointed out, the Congress has re-enacted this statue in almost the identical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.461" offset="1961749">We point out in footnote 15 on page 24 that the Congress had explicit notification in 1949 of the Secretary's construction and application of the statute and nonetheless re-enacted the statute, knowing that he did not apply it to the non excessive remission of a excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.833" offset="2075225">Also and perhaps even more pertinently, in 1973 when the Zenith petition was pending before the Secretary, a witness requested an amendment to require the countervailing non excessive remission and that amendment was rejected and the Congress of course was aware not only of the practice that is attacked here, but also of its application indeed to the litigant before us.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.262" offset="2852942">Well, certainly in this case the Secretary did not say that much, he said that for years and and he must (Voice Overlap) about for the democracy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wade H. Mccree</label>
            <text syncTime="704.091" offset="2896305">If the Court please, that is correct and we would agree that a detailed reason would have to be given if the Secretary was considering something that had not been considered by him before, but here ever since as our brief on page 10, I think note 5 points out, since 1898 in the first Synopsis of decision 696 has made the same construction and after having done that since 1898 if my memory serves is the year that Spanish war began and and varyingly he has so interpreted and applied the statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.097" offset="3076341">So we suggest that under those circumstances, perhaps he need not give the kind of detailed reasoning that would be necessary otherwise for appropriate judicial review of his acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.791" offset="3159097">If the Court please I share the Court's concern for responsible administrative action and I think that is that something an administrator should do, but I suggest that when this is a consistent application perhaps here we need not be as concerned as we might be otherwise if it were a new application.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.413" offset="3269543">I’d like to suggest that not only has the Secretary consistently made this interpretation, but also the international trading community understands this to be the construction of our statute and indeed in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an acronym pronounced GATT, the agreement which we have entered into through the executive to the branch of the government because the Congress has not specifically set forth that the non excessive remission of a consumption tax or an excise tax that this Japanese community tax as my brother would agree is, is not the grant of a bounty or subsidy that would trigger the imposition of countervailing duties which all of the subscribers to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade employ in one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.425" offset="3565667">So we suggest that here we have 80 years of uninterrupted, unvarying construction of the statute, of the original statute with Congressional re-enactment 5 times with awareness not only of the practice, but also of the specific application to Zenith, the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.037" offset="3680083">We suggest that the classification that the administrator has adopted is reasonable under all the circumstances and so that even if this case fell outside of it, it would still be appropriate as this Court has recognized if a classification is reasonable, although we do not have to argue that because we believe that this case is well inside of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.126" offset="3848416">We would also like to observe that as my brother has argued and as the dissent in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals urges, this is not inconsistent with any of the decisions of this Court as Mr. Justice Stevens' inquiry yesterday afternoon brought out, in the Downs case which my brother urges is a governing precedent and would require this Court to the rule to the contrary, we did not have an excessive remission of an excise tax simplicitor, we have there instead the remission of the tax and the bestowing of a certificate which was the matter of great economic value and as the colloquy between the Court and my brother developed and demonstrated, the amount of the duty that was countervailed was either the value of that certificate or a profit derived from the exercise of that certificate and was not in the amount of a excise tax that was remitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.270" offset="4149034">Also my brother made reference to other authority which he believe was controlling of this, contrary to the position of the government, we suggest that in examination of that authority would reveal that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.932" offset="4215698">The Nicolas case involve a clear export premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.811" offset="4239208">This was a case involving the export of spirits from the British Isles to the United States and therein an express premium of (Inaudible) and 5 pence on different quality or strength of spirits was bestowed and indeed the question there was whether there was some warehouse tax that would justify England giving this advantage found to be a grant or bounty and the Court held that regardless of the British Government's purpose, it was indeed a grant or bounty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1183.221" offset="4812857">There was a double tax on the surplus sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.195" offset="4828740">The sugar in the middle apparently was subject to manipulation by bureaucracy that over saw this entire scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.630" offset="4874506">To sell the surplus sugar to double tax was prohibitive so nobody would want to do that, but apparently some of these person would like to export that and if they exported that sugar then the tax would be remitted and it could go abroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.020" offset="9176038">I would like very much to turn back to Downs and the issue as put to the court, Downs argued after the Board of General Appraisers decided against them and after the Fourth Circuit decided against them, they argued before this Court that the lower courts were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.690" offset="9246673">They argued that the lower courts found that the Russian Scheme conferred two bounties, a bounty by the reason of the tax remission, a bounty by reason of the conferring of the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.349" offset="9301321">Downs maybe clear to the Court that this was his understanding of what the lower court had said and then Downs argued in this brief that courts below are wrong on both issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.246" offset="9344893">Downs argued that the certificate did not constituted a bounty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.470" offset="9361821">Downs also argued that the remission of tax did not constitute a bounty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.404" offset="9393585">This was squarely put before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.697" offset="9402676">It was briefed by Downs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.508" offset="9409990">Downs headed a section of this brief with the following language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.508" offset="9429948">The remission of excise taxes on the exportation of sugar is not a bounty or grant on exportation as the terms are used in Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.189" offset="9464743">The government joined issue with Downs on both points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.692" offset="9478745">The government said that both the remission of the tax could be a bounty and both the certificate could be a bounty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.320" offset="9505181">The Court then decided the issues presented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.469" offset="9529840">I would like to turn to some other remarks made by my distinguished advisory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.508" offset="9550007">He indicated that in 1949, Congress received explicit notice of Treasury's practice and did not amended it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.767" offset="9586996">However, that is not the entire story because in that period of time, 1949 and 1950, when the executive branch brought Treasury's practice to the attention Congress, it asked Congress to amend the law because there was a potential conflict between Treasury's practice and judicial interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.345" offset="9669334">Congress refused to amend the law.</text>
