            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79984">We hear arguments first this morning in Crist against Cline.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.132" offset="112480">Mr. Keller, you may proceed, whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Keller</label>
            <text syncTime="11.866" offset="127422">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.347" offset="141320">You will recall this matter was remanded to be re-briefed and re-argued on two expanded issues and the first issue was whether or not the federal rule that jeopardy attaches in jury trials, when the jury is sworn is constitutionally mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.880" offset="203491">I think after reading the briefs in this thing that we can fairly agree without arguing that at the time of the constitution it was not constitutionally mandated and it was not a part of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.740" offset="246854">There were two common law rules at that time, Lord Coke's Rule and -- and the Double Jeopardy Rule and when we get to as far as Perez.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.675" offset="282590">Perez in the Touch Tone case of manifest necessity says, “This is not a Fifth Amendment consideration, this is not Double Jeopardy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="59.487" offset="317907">Perez was going into the question of whether or not it is permissible to take away that defendant’s right to a jury, once the jury is empaneled to sworn, Lord Coke’s Rule made it mandatory that you go to court for the verdict, but it clearly at that time was not a part nor considered a part of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.518" offset="402022">It does not become that until -- and various jurisdictions in construing the rule of practice or the Lord Coke's Rule, there were dismissals.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.360" offset="437339">There were improper dismissals and they held the improper dismissal to be tantamount to a jury verdict and as a consequence of that, then it was Jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.175" offset="488644">In the original concept of the common law, there could be no such thing as a failure of a jury to reach a verdict, is not that correct?</text>
            <text syncTime="110.360" offset="521349">They lock them up on bread and water and they would come back with a verdict on whenever they ready?</text>

You do not see any changes in that, until Blackstone does bring out the words -- maybe there would be evident necessity, but it took a real necessity, a juror had to die, a hung jury are the things that gave them all their (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="132.583" offset="610270">There was no such thing as a hung jury in the concept of jury common law?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_keller" startTime="134.736" stopTime="206.707">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Keller</label>
            <text syncTime="134.736" offset="618838">No, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.291" offset="625107">Ironically in the common law states, common law to get clue, in Pennsylvania and I am talking about cases that were all decided back between 1800 and 1820, they upheld Lord Coke’s Rule and that jury had gone 36 hours, 24 without food or drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.032" offset="696056">Two jurors, 75 years of age or older, who had just got out of the hospital were in trouble and the doctor looked at them and said if they have some food or drink, something they can go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.062" offset="736180">So, the judge permitted the jury to vote on it and the jury said, “No, do not give it to them” and obviously they had them hanging on the ropes and the judge finally let them off the hook and dismissed the jury and that Pennsylvania Supreme Court held, “No, this was improper and free the defendants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="181.252" offset="804934">They ought not to be and they took a strict reading of -- of Lord Coke’s Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.033" offset="828026">This gets commented on, not only later by me, but when I start talking about the Arizona against the Washington case and wonder weather or not we even ought to be here today in the face of that case, that opinion, but that case recites the reason why you do not keep a jury under that pressure and certainly as you mean, it is ironic.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="206.707" offset="906812">Was there an earlier time when even after an acquittal, prosecutions were brought again and again until --?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_keller" startTime="216.268" stopTime="620.925">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Keller</label>
            <text syncTime="216.268" offset="945055">This is a recited fact during the reign of the Stewarts, Mr. Chief Justice and Lord Coke's Rule would have come down early in the 1600s and between that time, in 1688 you would had reign of two kings, the Stewarts at that time, yes there were re-prosecutions until the prosecution could get a sufficient case together, and it was horribly abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.115" offset="1036379">The history as I read it that as of the revolution in 1688, they went back to Lord Coke's Rule and we did not have that occurring anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.665" offset="1070547">The second part of your question is if there were an acquittal, would there be a re-prosecution?</text>
            <text syncTime="253.882" offset="1095416">Short of the reign of the Stewart and I do not know the answer to that because that comes out on a case so we know of no time, one there was ever an acquit of a re-prosecution and as a consequence of that whether it was by a rule of Court or whatever the rule, as a consequence of the acquittal, than the double jeopardy application of the common law came into the effect and I cannot answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.052" offset="1192173">I know of no case, whether has been an acquittal and a re-prosecution, but I was not researching from that standpoint either.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.188" offset="1224670">When we researched this and found that the time of jeopardy at the common law is at the time of the verdict of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.837" offset="1255285">There was not any question in our minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.279" offset="1261032">One; nobody today is going to go back that far in time and say that jeopardy does not attach until the time of the verdict, as it was at the common law and we felt that for simple reasons that we had too much law since then, particularly combining manifest necessity with double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.539" offset="1334071">Two; fundamentally it was just unconstitutional you can put a defendant to the blade, you can commit his defenses and still not say that jeopardy attaches, but we had real problems in briefing this, in getting the vehicle to come -- to come forward from the time of -- of the judgment up to where we want to be today.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.258" offset="1421006">We did not know what the vehicle was and then came Arizona against Washington and the vehicle is the “valued right” concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.562" offset="1454129">Downum in 1963, Justice Tuttle in the Ninth circuit in this case said that Downum necessarily has to stand for the proposition that jeopardy attaches at the time that the jury is sworn and the reason that Downum stands for that is because that case involved a case where after the jury was sworn and before the first witness was sworn, the case ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.903" offset="1543573">They did not have their witnesses for count 6 and 7 and the trial was terminated and from that, Justice Tuttle says, “Downum necessarily stands for this position” and I submit that when you read Arizona against Washington today, you have to come out with the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.784" offset="1611073">Arizona against Washington said, “This was an improper opening statement by a counsel, in this case defense counsel, but made at that time between the swearing of the jury and before the first witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.166" offset="1660601">The fact that two witnesses testified in that case are really incidental to the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.171" offset="1680663">The rationale is the “valued right” concept goes back to the time of opening statements and that of necessity is before the time that the first witness is sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.671" offset="1722668">So reading this case as you read Downum, you have to say Arizona against Washington stands for this proposition and that means that the only thing that we can really argue today to this Court is that we do not feel that the “valued right” concept means all of that and we are not sure that what this Court meant, when it said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.413" offset="1797587">And the reason that I say that is that this Court was particularly careful in the opinion, not to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.873" offset="1827471">Arizona against Washington was argued the before the day we argued the last time, so it was pending during the time that our case was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.628" offset="1854430">Much of what was said in Arizona against Washington comes out of the briefs that we submitted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.253" offset="1876895">So, that we know that the Court was conscious of this case when the opinion was written and yet the Court assiduously did not say jeopardy attaches at the time that the jury is sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.902" offset="1915556">So, we do not know what we are talking about in terms of “valued right” as the vehicle for bringing jeopardy from the time of verdict, up to some starting point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.567" offset="1966234">If you read the reasons for the valued right in the Arizona case, then you find that it is to avoid emotional and financial burden a retrial would cause as you find this to prolong the -- avoid the prolongation of the period of stigma and it may even enhance risk that an innocent defendant maybe convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.960" offset="2043765">That means if you read it literally, you could even be going back to the time that you first select the panel from which you are going to voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.057" offset="2072186">We do not know where the starting point is on the valued right concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.788" offset="2091099">We do know, what has been argued under the valued right that this valued right is a right to a particular tribunal and that is expressed as early as 1840 in United States against Shoemaker, it is Lord Coke’s rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.136" offset="2148464">You are entitled to this panel, this particular jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.188" offset="2164660">And is also has been argued that the valued right means that anything that goes to that jury, whether it is in the voir dire questioning, whether it is in the opening statement, anything that does something to that tribunal makes that tribunal valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.543" offset="2218054">Serfass, United States against Serfass held that the constitutional policy is underpinning the Fifth Amendment are not implicated until jeopardy attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.890" offset="2259537">Serfass also held that this Court has consistently adhered to the view that jeopardy does not attach until the defendant is put to trial before the trier of the facts, jury or non-jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.932" offset="2303631">And then Serfass held, in two different places, without risk of determination of guilt, jeopardy does not attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.692" offset="2338740">Now, if we read the Serfass case in conjunction with Arizona against Washington, then we are saying that clearly jeopardy does not attach before the time the jury is sworn and no later than the time that the first witness is sworn and we have at least narrowed it down to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.599" offset="2410315">If we go back to those points then, then when we talk about the financial and emotional burden that was expressed in the Arizona case, that is not applicable to that narrow period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.034" offset="2456082">What difference are we talking about in finances or emotions between the time the jury is sworn and the time the first witness is sworn?</text>
            <text syncTime="601.767" offset="2487011">The second reason given is the prolonging of the stigma and that distinction has gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.941" offset="2507700">Surely, we are not talking about a prolonging of a stigma between the time the jury is sworn and the first witness is sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.624" offset="2534449">And, the last is enhancing the risk of conviction of an innocent man and that cannot happen until the first witness is sworn.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.765" offset="2671017">I have never heard a defense counsel say anything in the beginning that the prosecution did not already know.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.915" offset="2699543">The only thing that they say is something that they want that jury to hear, which the prosecution already knows and they want the jury to keep a fair mind on something.</text>

            <text syncTime="673.125" offset="2772477">That is right, but at least we have reached the point that we are not going to hold constitutionally that somebody is entitled to anything less than a fair jury, so what you have done to the jury in the voir dire, is not something that is entitled to protection and this gets to the point that I was reaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.869" offset="2835380">The real concept of a “valued right” to me is any trial lawyer knows that that when that defendant goes through a retrial, let us say a hung jury, so we do not have any problem there, he really has the odds against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.891" offset="2887520">This was brought out in the Arizona case, by Judge Leventhal in the Carsey case and Judge Leventhal pegged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.194" offset="2912702">The second time through, those -- those witnesses whose weaknesses were developed by cross examination by defense in the first case, they start to shore up their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.635" offset="2954498">It is not a -- it is not a significant alteration, but it is there and I have yet to see the defendant go through a retrial that everything did not change.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.812" offset="2991174">All of the surprise is gone. The prosecution knows where he has gone after the first dry run.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.401" offset="3013535">The prosecution does not know that in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.795" offset="3023148">They have to be prepared against anything his defense counsel will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.266" offset="3037045">In the second run, there is no spontaneity, there is nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.226" offset="3048853">That defendant has an impossible burden that second time, he really does and this is the reason why -- I thought about this after the argument last time.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.742" offset="3082916">You know I argued to you then as matter of law and as a matter of fact that defendant is not in jeopardy until something comes up that makes out a prima-facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.816" offset="3123145">And I was arguing from Serfass that without risk of determination of guilt, but I thought about this afterwards and I thought, you know really, from the time that the defense counsel makes his first objection or does not make his objection as a matter of strategy, that defense is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.247" offset="3188869">That is when they really going in and expose their hand to the prosecution and from that point on, that defendant does have a valued right to get this matter heard by this jury, by this judge, by whatever because now, for the first time, when he did not have to, he has tipped his hand and now his concern is interest is there, is important or as was said in Jorn in defining the same valued right, if the right is valued it is because the defendant has a significant interest in the decision of whether or not to take it from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.129" offset="3320422">And I submit, until the time that the defense counsel has done something in this case, it tips his hand to the prosecution, up until that point it is not the time of interest that is so significant, but deserves constitutional protection, but from that point on it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.624" offset="3386459">Rather than try and find out in any given case when that is, then it is the time evidence is given.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.994" offset="7107863">With the Court’s permission, there are two issues in this case that I do not intend to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.284" offset="7129075">First is the question of manifest necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.137" offset="7140464">As we noted in our opening brief, the record in this case, does not permit a determination of a number of factors essential to a resolution on manifest necessity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.690" offset="7178707">Since it does not indicate whether appellees resisted the amendment of count two of the initial information or whether they objected to the dismissal of that count or to the dismissal of the remaining counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.537" offset="7230116">In any event, the state appears to have abandoned that issue in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.276" offset="7249029">The second question that I do not plan to address at any length, is whether the State should be free to adopt a rule for the attachment of jeopardy that differs from the rule applicable in federal courts, is not a matter in which the Federal Government has a substantial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.273" offset="7309006">It is our view, however, that there is little to justify disparity in the rule as applied to state and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.342" offset="7337323">The Double Jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment is of course fully enforceable against the states to the Fourteenth Amendment and the time when jeopardy attaches would appear to be an essential ingredient of the Double Jeopardy guarantee rather than a mere incidental or procedural feature that may be varied without doing damage to the basic constitutional right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="1841.340" offset="7445261">Well, the issue that is of concern to the United States is when this jeopardy attaches as a matter of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.711" offset="7466786">If the Court were then to hold that the States may be free to vary, that portion of the Court’s opinion would be of no substantial interest to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.671" offset="7502626">I would like to limit my discussion then to the essential question posed by the Court in its order of December 5th, that is when as the matter of constitutional mandate, does jeopardy attach?</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.736" offset="7546825">Now, at -- at common law, as Mr. Keller has indicated, indeed even today in England jeopardy did not attach until verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.602" offset="7578381">The historical record leaves little doubt that this was the understanding of the framers to the Fifth Amendment and that the Double Jeopardy Clause was not originally intended to bar the re-prosecution of the defendant whose first trial was aborted for whatever reasons, prior to verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.797" offset="7639089">Despite this background, it is settled today that the Double Jeopardy Clause is more than a mere constitutionalization of res judicata principles, plus the prohibition of government appeals from acquittals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.431" offset="7685692">The Clause also protects the “defendant’s valued right” as this Court has said in a number of occasions, to have this trial completed once it has begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.252" offset="7720905">In other words, a right to go to verdict and perhaps to end the dispute then and there with an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.025" offset="7743997">Obviously, in order to protect the defendant’s interest in receiving the verdict of the first fact-finder and hence avoiding repetitive trials, jeopardy must attach at some point prior to the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.251" offset="7788928">Question then is that what point in a criminal proceeding does the defendant’s interest in going forward with a trial to its completion and not being required to begin a new, becomes sufficiently substantial to support the conclusion that jeopardy has attached and accordingly, that subsequent trial terminations must be judged under the unyielding requirements of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.811" offset="7879207">In fixing this point, we believe that the Court should be guided by three considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.183" offset="7900627">First consideration, which was alluded to earlier by Mr. Justice Stevens, is that the time of the attachment of jeopardy should represent the bright line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.931" offset="7939706">This is an area in which the need for certainty and predictability is especially important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.916" offset="7959560">Unless the point at which the defendant has been placed in jeopardy can be identified with precision in every trial, judges would be forced to guess as to the propriety of terminating the proceedings prematurely, in a situation perhaps not amounting to manifest necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.969" offset="8023821">An incorrect assessment may leave to -- lead to immunity for a defendant whose guilt is capable of establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.341" offset="8049316">For these reasons, we doubt that the tests offered by the state in this case, which appears to depend, first upon the sufficiency of the evidence that had been introduced, and now when the defendant’s lawyer may have committed himself in some way, or in Professor Schulhofer’s recent article, which is relied on by appellee Cline, which depends in part upon a necessarily subjective view of the difficulties encountered in voir dire, I doubt whether either of those tests would be workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.098" offset="8164360">The second, we believe that jeopardy should attach at the same point in jury and non-jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.067" offset="8184213">As this Court observed in Jenkins, the Double Jeopardy Clause nowhere distinguishes between jury and bench trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.427" offset="8213679">The defendant’s risk of conviction is precisely the same in either type of trial and whether the fact-finder is the judge or the jury, defendant has the identical Fifth Amendment interest in completing the trial, hopefully with an acquittal once it has begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.877" offset="8275432">Finally, the point that selected for the attachment of jeopardy must be responsive to the evils of re-prosecution that the Double Jeopardy Clause was historically designed to prevent, that is the anxieties, the strain and expense suffered by the defendant who is forced to undergo repetitive trials, the possibility of manipulation or harassment by a prosecutor, particularly the chance of a second opportunity to convict the defendant if the first trial is viewed as proceeding unfavorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.984" offset="8391834">Now, with those three underlying principles in mind, the United States believes that the Constitution does not require jeopardy to attach in any case, state or federal, jury or non-jury, until the fact-finder first begins to receive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.717" offset="8454841">Only when the government begins to meet its burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime charged, can it truly be said that the defendant faces the risk of conviction and it is the risk of conviction that this Court stated in Reid against Jones that the constitutional concept of jeopardy connotes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.304" offset="8533104">The point at which evidence going to the general issue of guilt or innocence is produced, marks a convenient and we believe logical boundary in every criminal case, separating pre-trial preliminaries which concededly do not deserve the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause from the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.332" offset="8609277">The rule of jeopardy attaches when the fact-finder begins to hear evidence, which is the -- of course the rule that has traditionally been applied in bench trials, fully accommodates the defendant’s Fifth Amendment interest. Prior to the introduction of evidence, the defendant’s interest in avoiding re-prosecution ordinarily is very weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.804" offset="8683151">He has not yet suffered any of the strains or emotional distress associated with being forced to undergo a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.338" offset="8709274">Moreover, the defendant has little, if any, stake at that pre-evidentiary stage in proceeding to a verdict in order to preserve any fact-findings that the finder of the fact may have made in his favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2683.971" offset="10815788">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.942" offset="10827700">The appellants in this case have taken the possession that the so called valued right to a particular tribunal is not of constitutional stature, rather it is a procedural practice, which has developed out of English common law, and the appellant has concluded that this valued right to a particular tribunal does not come into play or does not attach until after the tribunal has actually heard the defendant’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.689" offset="10930727">As to the Double Jeopardy Clause, the appellant takes the position in his brief that jeopardy does not attach until after the state has presented some evidence from which the jury could actually convict the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.020" offset="10984017">The solicitor on the other hand has assumed a more moderate position and has urged this Court that jeopardy should attach no later than the swearing of the first witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.397" offset="11029470">I submit to the Court that the -- this -- the Court’s recent opinion in Arizona versus Washington contradicts both the position of the appellant and of the solicitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.211" offset="11072728">In the Arizona case, the defense counsel engaged in some references during his opening statement to inadmissible evidence and as a consequence of that reference, the trial Court had to declare a mistrial at the request of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.346" offset="11141274">On a Federal Habeas Corpus appeal, this Court subjected the trial court’s actions to a Double Jeopardy analysis and manifest necessity analysis and concluded that there was manifest necessity for the -- the declaration of the mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.490" offset="11209924">The import of that case lies in the fact that the -- the incident arose during the opening statements and that this Court decided that case on the grounds of double jeopardy even though the first witness had not been sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.025" offset="11268020">And I submit to the Court that implicit in the Arizona decision, is a conclusion that Federal Double Jeopardy had attached, at least as early as the opening statement and of course the opening statement is prior in time to the point which has been suggested by the solicitor and is prior in time to the point which has been suggested by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.070" offset="11356209">If, as the solicitor has argued, Double Jeopardy interest could not come into play --</text>

            <text syncTime="3635.909" offset="14623605">I think that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution is one of the important issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.649" offset="14658505">I think the question that is raised here, where it says that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, that the history of that Amendment in 1866, while through the Adamson case of Justice Black, which started the incorporation theory is a relevant issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.202" offset="14764771">Should the Court adopt a position under the Fourteenth Amendment that the states should follow case by case, jot by jot, under the incorporation theory --</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles F. Moses</label>
            <text syncTime="3687.287" offset="14829032">Yes, he wrote a dissenting opinion and what he did in the dissenting opinion Mr. Justice Rehnquist was to set forth all of the congressional proceedings where Bingham, the congressman in 1866 said, “I sponsored or I wrote this Fourteenth Amendment because of the case of Barron versus Baltimore which said simply that the first 8 Amendments applied only to the Federal Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.396" offset="14929551">So that the construction of the Fourteenth Amendment, I think has a measure of importance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.336" offset="14957241">The reason that I say that because if it is in origin, a privilege or immunity that is not rare or abstract, but is something that is recognized by the courts, then that is something that should be enforced under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.105" offset="15028399">I raise that issue because I think that then, the federal and the state would have the same privileges and immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.116" offset="15056402">It would be consistent with the Supremacy Clause as we understand it, the Law of the Land, the bench and the bar would know exactly what the rule was and I think that that is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.707" offset="15102795">The reason that I mention that is because of the second issue, under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that is not the privileges and immunities, but is the Due Process section and it seems to me as I read the cases, that we will apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment those constitutional rights the Court deems fundamental, and thus apply federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.301" offset="15197150">It is a selective incorporation as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.011" offset="15211987">It seems to me that Benton versus Maryland, which is an important case on the issue of jeopardy, raises that issue of selective incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.220" offset="15244797">In other words, what we are saying is that under the Due Process of the Fourteenth Amendment is that Double Jeopardy is a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.923" offset="15275622">We can agree upon that, but that is not the end of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.243" offset="15292862">Is the time it attaches simply non-constitutional baggage?</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.274" offset="15313029">If we are going to be selective in our incorporation of the first 8 amendments, and of course, that raises the question of whether it is implicit in the right given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.185" offset="15368722">I would like to use the word parsing or pick a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.684" offset="15382619">Jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.654" offset="15398502">If you just say, jeopardy attaches and leave out when the jury is empaneled and sworn, then I think the language is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.585" offset="15434237">It does not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.756" offset="15442910">You are going to have to say that jeopardy attaches either when the jury is empaneled and sworn to make it complete or when the state says it does or when the first witness, so that I think it is implicit even under the selective incorporation rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.154" offset="15500588">There has been a lot of opposition to this incorporation doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.598" offset="15518351">Justice Stewart has written upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.797" offset="15531099">One of the things that I think has to be decided is whether we are going to reject the incorporation theory entirely under the Fourteenth Amendment, and I think that is relevant to this particular decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.296" offset="15573104">The first 8 amendments are only applicable to federal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.831" offset="15599226">Any school boy knows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.741" offset="15610929">States may adopt a rule and states may adopt any standard they wish, subject only to the strictures of their own state law or Constitutions in the fundamental fairness test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.538" offset="15666100">You may want to adopt that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.827" offset="15671220">Now, if that -- if that is done, it seems to me that we have a chancellor's foot standard and we are going back to Palko and Twining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.289" offset="15717091">I think those are the issues in my judgment in this case is the application of the Due Process Clause, whether we are going to have complete incorporation, selective incorporation, or rejection of the incorporation doctrine. One of the difficulties, if I may add this to my argument very briefly, is that there is great uncertainty in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.376" offset="15805385">Lawyers do not know how to advise their clients?</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.202" offset="15816774">Lawyers do not know how to argue before the courts because they simply do not know what the law is?</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.231" offset="15844882">That is why I -- I think there should be some certainty in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.022" offset="15860033">We have in Montana, for instance, take Winship on reasonable doubt, it is a requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3973.591" offset="15974345">We have had difficulty and I have had difficulty in another state with Brady versus Maryland. The Court has simply said, “We do not accept Brady.</text>
