            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="46.284" offset="265497">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.379" offset="285873">The case of Sandra Lockett v. Ohio, raises many of the same issues relating to the constitutionality of the Ohio death penalty statutes that were involved in the Bell case just argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.981" offset="344283">However, in the Lockett case there are also serious federal constitutional questions in regard to the procedures through which Ms Lockett’s conviction of the crime of aggravated murder was obtained, and because the Court will not and need not reach the question of penalty, unless it affirms her conviction on the merits, I would like to devote some portion of my argument time to the issue of whether or not a federal constitutional was violated in this Lockett’s conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.151" offset="476985">By improper prosecutory or comment on our failure to take the witness stand in her defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.238" offset="509377">In addressing this issue, let me if I May it please the court, just describe very briefly the background of this trial and the respective theories of the parties at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.646" offset="554934">Ms Lockett stands convicted and condemned of the crime of aggravated murder for a killing of Sidney Cohen, a pawnshop proprietor in the course of a pawnshop robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.951" offset="628182">At the time that Mr. Cohen was killed, the gun was in the hands of Al Parker, the chief say prosecution witness in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.129" offset="668933">The prosecutions theory is that, Parker, petitioner’s brother James Lockett, one at Nathan Dew and the petitioner, had conspired and planned together to rob Sid's Market Loan Company that they had all gone there for that purpose, the petitioner had remained outside in the car, that the three man had gone in, committed the robbery in the course of which according to Parker’s own testimony, Mr. Cohen snatched at the gun and it went off accidentally and although the killing was totally outside the plan of the robbery, he was killed.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.931" offset="824100">You are saying totally outside of the plan, and I am not sure what do you mean by that -- stands of death and they had bullets in the gun, did they not?</text>

            <text syncTime="200.301" offset="881569">If Your Honor will look at page 62, the question was asked now, Al, the purpose to go to the pawnshop was to do what? What was the plan when you went to the pawnshop to do what?</text>
            <text syncTime="209.666" offset="919081">Answer to rob.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.831" offset="959728">And of course, I suppose on that theory the perpetrators would not need any bullets in the gun, if they had no intention or whatever making using of, would they?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

          <turn speaker="anthony_g_amsterdam" startTime="245.362" stopTime="515.791">
            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="245.362" offset="1061814">There was a plan to, they did not enter the pawnshop with gun even if with bullets and they certainly did arm a gun which was in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.819" offset="1091698">There is no doubt to the plan included using a loaded weapon, but the plan did not include killing and it is not one of these execution style, kill a witness type of things according to the prosecutor’s own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.798" offset="1143630">For purposes of the self-incrimination issue however, what is important is this, that the prosecution theory as against petitioner, is entirely if she was a party to this conspiracy to go in and rob.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.968" offset="1212279">The defense theory was not that the petitioner did not know her brother and Dew and Parker whether she was somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.699" offset="1247179">The defense admitted that she went with him to the pawnshop and sat outside, but the defendant’s contention was that there was no plan to rob at all and that she thought they were going into pawn a ring.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.384" offset="1289915">No, all of the evidence which connects the petitioner with a specific plan to rob the pawnshop is Parker’s testimony, if this Court will examine the opinion of the Ohio Supreme Court, it will find that it is whole recitation of the facts of the case consists of recitation of Parker’s testimony, with a statement that it was corroborated by the testimony of several other minor witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.148" offset="1404959">What is significant however is that the testimony of those witnesses while corroborating parts of Parker’s and well consistent with a theory of petitioner’s guilt, was also a perfectly consistent with a theory of petitioner’s innocence including the very theory of petitioner’s innocence as spoused by the petitioner at trial, namely that she was just along for the rob.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.030" offset="1496492">Now, against this background, the following things happened in the trial - petitioner did not testify, that was not a happy incident which a lawyer indicated she would take the stand, but she declined and did not, she called the only two members of the conspiracy, Dew and her brother, whom the prosecution did not present because Parker was the chief prosecution witness and they both took the faith in front of the juror, leaving all of the, conspirator's out of a count as possible witnesses and then in the course of closing argument in the case, the prosecutor made the argument of which we complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.413" offset="1646017">In a theme that recurs constantly throughout the argument and staccato repetition underlining for emphasis about theme, the prosecutor repeated again and again, seven times in all, that the prosecution’s evidence was uncontradicted and unrefuted and the prosecutor closed uncontradicted and unrefuted evidence, nothing from the defense, no evidence from the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.587" offset="1758761">Now, our submission is simply that in the context of this case, that would be taken by the jury to direct their attention to the defendants’ failure to take a stand in her own behalf and is therefore a forbidden comment under privilege against self-incrimination and vitiates her conviction under Griffin v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.099" offset="1852802">To argue this point, I think I need only make a factual analysis, if I may of Parker’s testimony because I think that if one understands what Parker’s testimony was about and how this case appeared to the jury, the Fifth Amendment issue can only be resolved one way. If you look at Parker’s testimony, you will find that there are a total of 15 episodes which in anyway could conceivably connect petitioner to the plot to rob the store, and by 15 episodes I do not want if it gives the mis-impression, there is a lot of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.591" offset="1998774">First of all, all this is Parker’s testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.671" offset="2007029">Secondly, many of these episodes are very minor details quite consistent with innocence or guilt, they are just part of the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.702" offset="2039212">But when I say episodes, I mean scenes, if you conceive of it as though we were projecting a movie or making a movie of these events.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.536" offset="2066588">There would be 16 scenes and that is important because the question is who is available to testify each of these scenes.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.756" offset="2091457">Our submission is that the only relevant scenes, the only witnesses are Parke, the defendant, the other co-defendants and therefore when the prosecutor says our evidence is uncontradicted, the jury says who could contradict it?</text>
            <text syncTime="514.256" offset="2137432">Answer is only the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="801.489" offset="3286402">I simply want to speak to two of the several constitutional attacks on Ohio’s death penalty because I think it is important to point out their relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.838" offset="3323705">One is the one of which the Court heard argument this morning that the Ohio death penalty statute is too narrow, too much circumscribes, consideration of mitigating circumstances to meet the command of the Woodson and Roberts cases that individualized consideration be given to circumstances of defense and offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.789" offset="3427568">The second argument which is raised in both Bell and Lockett, is the argument that the application of the death penalty to a person who was neither a participant in the killing nor an intentional perpetrator of any act that was directed to a killing, for instance, proportionality principle in Coker and earlier cases because Justice Marshall has alleged, Sandra Lockett may be a felon, but not murdered, not a deliberate taker of human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.990" offset="3564345">Now, I want to point out though that there is a relationship between those two arguments because in combination they produce still a third constitutional intention which is the narrowest conceivable ground on which these cases could be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.994" offset="3636338">In as mush as the very circumstance which we contend precludes the death penalty totally.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.994" offset="3660371">That is the fact that Sandra Lockett has been condemned for a crime which she did not do, did not attempt, did not intend and it is to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.220" offset="3709272">In as much as that factor of the case, it is one of the very factors its consideration of the Ohio statute precludes.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.707" offset="3739261">This Court could decide these cases simply on the ground that whether or not it would be constitutional for a state to impose the death penalty in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.404" offset="3774056">It is unconstitutional for the state to do so while forbidding the sentence or even to consider the mitigating circumstance, that the defendant was not the perpetrator of the crime and neither intended nor did anything in furtherance of the killing itself as distinguished in the underlying robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.271" offset="3849497">Now, that argument and the arguments about the narrowness of the Ohio statute in preclusion of consideration of mitigating circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="960.641" offset="3922954">There is no attack here at all on felony murder concept, as far as conviction goes that is perfectly appropriate, but if Coker has any meaning, one of its meanings must be that if the defendant’s conviction rests only on the felony that the death sentence which is being imposed not for the murder, but only for the felony is disproportionate.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.158" offset="4016995">Our argument goes only to the death penalty nothing to do with the constitutionality of felony murder as a basic conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.192" offset="4041132">That is perfectly acceptable, but I think it is important to recognize on the facts of this case however is the fact that that is exactly what petitioner is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.591" offset="4082719">She is at most an armed robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.113" offset="4100795">She has the mental state, the culpability of any participant in any armed robbery and no more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.246" offset="4125350">The prosecution in its brief suggests that the jury must have found that the defendant intended to kill Sidney Cohen because part of the element of aggravated murder is purposely killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.796" offset="4179581">I want to dispel that theory right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.843" offset="4187731">It is true that the Court charged to the jury that, but it also charge to the jury and this was a key to this whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.546" offset="4210614">At pages 118 and 119 of the appendix, a person engaged in a common design with others to rsob by force and violence on individual or individuals of their property is presumed to acquiesce and whatever may reasonably be necessary to accomplish the object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.796" offset="4275607">If under the circumstances it may reasonably be expected that the victim’s life would be in danger by the manner and means of performing a criminal act, each one engaged in a common design is bound by the consequences naturally or probably arising in its furtherance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.206" offset="4333181">If the conspired robbery in a manner of its accomplishment would be reasonably likely to produce that, each plotter is equally guilty with the principle offender as an aider and abettor in a homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.262" offset="4373409">An intent to kill by an aider and abettor may be found on to exist beyond the reasonable doubt under such circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.371" offset="4393889">Now, later on that same page the Court defines, intent as the same thing as purpose and elsewhere in this charge, it talks about inferences as a very different thing for presumption, so what the jury was charged in this case, was that it should find the defendant guilty of purposely killing Sydney Cohen if she participated in an armed robbery attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.167" offset="4485109">The Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court affirmed her convictions on exactly that theory, indeed the very issue which divided the Ohio Supreme Court here four to three would never reason on the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.518" offset="4526487">So what we are dealing with is we are dealing with a case in which the defendant has been sentenced to die for nothing more than participation in an armed robbery which at someone else’s hands resulted in death, no.</text>

            <text syncTime="1249.074" offset="5076730">That is to say even if the death penalty can be imposed on Parker, for Ohio to say as it has that whether he shot and deliberately and intentionally killed Sydney Cohen or whether they gone or went off by accident is not relevant, may not even be considered in sentencing that violates the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.493" offset="5138379">Now, whether Ohio could say that an unintended killing by someone who is their taking steps toward killing with a knowledge that is not like, that poses a difficult question and this case does not pose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.862" offset="6803842">Turning to the mitigation phase I would like to point out to the Court that the Ohio Supreme Court in a number of cases has substantially broadened the initial conception or definitions of mental deficiency and psychosis and I point them out in my brief, they are specifically State v. Black and State v. Bell where they broaden the interpretation and while it is true that you take all these factors in consideration in reaching the one of the three specific statutory grounds for mitigation, the Court does consider them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.442" offset="6982206">They do consider each one of the factors that the petitioner complains about the age, the mental state, the degree of participation all work together in reaching one of the statutory grounds and I asked this Court to compare this framework, Ohio’s framework with that of Texas wherein any evidence of mitigation was not in and of itself a basis for mitigation, but had to be utilized in answering a specific question and in Jurek it was whether or not the defendant would be a continuing threat to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.361" offset="7149808">Each one of those factors was not in and of themselves significant, that a degree of participation or the age or use or the mental state, but they were all taken in consideration through the judicial interpretation of the statute and I would ask this Court to do the same thing with regard to Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.690" offset="7231205">Ohio does consider these factors in reaching their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.326" offset="7261716">Petitioner claims that this mitigating factor never works and it is not true Nathan Earl Dew was mitigated on this theory ground, a co-conspirator of the petitioner, but Nathan Earl Dew was the pawn that was directed by the petitioner who planned this, who directed them to go to Sidney Cohen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.221" offset="13157239">Justice Powell, may I now direct your honors attention to page 141 of the appendix, in which the trial judge here explicitly defined mental deficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.377" offset="13229860">This has no juror, judge is making a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.874" offset="13239891">The judge says, mental retardation and mental deficiency under the law are synonymous and many goes onto read out of the DSM 2 that is Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association II Edition, the number categorizing, is saying that not only his mental deficiency identical to mental retardation, you do not have the score -- but you have to score about 70 you are not retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.621" offset="13342918">That is why we say that always business about how broadly the Ohio Supreme Court has construed the statute as non sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.269" offset="13373429">The only case in which the Ohio Supreme Court has given a broad construction, the mental deficiency of the black patient, it did not apply the statute to any state of facts in the black patient, simply answering a constitutional challenge that the statute is weighed for vagueness, wherever it has had to apply the term mental deficiency to state of facts, it has said that educational deprivation is not mental deficiency, cultural deprivation is not mental deficiency, emotional deprivation is not mental deficiency, it means mental retardation and if it meant more than that this case would have to be reversed because the trial judge found the facts, found them on the theory that the defendant could be found to have a mitigating circumstance and to escape the death penalty, only if you are mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.792" offset="13571542">Now, that brings me back to the question of degree of culpability being considered and if I may speak again to the felony murder question, because I think I were being very unclear on Ohio law as to this, and this is a key question, everyone has asked about it, I think it needs to be be cleared off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.825" offset="13631728">The answer is that Ohio does not have the traditional felony murder rule, that Justice Stewart and justice Rehnquist were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.304" offset="13657641">If you look at page 205 of the appendix, the Ohio Supreme Court says that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.318" offset="13681674">Under Ohio and this is not for aggravated murder, this is for first degree murder at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.006" offset="13700377">There has got to be a purposeful killing in the course of a felony, but what they then say is that any felony which is done with a deadly weapon creates a risk of death as its natural and probable consequence and that one who engages in such a felony is presumed to have intended to kill.</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.163" offset="13825034">Most states said if you have a killing in the course of a felony, you do not have to intent, you get felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.005" offset="13848439">Ohio says you have to have an intentional killing in the course of a felony, but a killing in the course of a felony with a deadly weapon is presumed to be intentional killing, so you get to exactly the same result and Justice Rehnquist in terms of the answer of your question presumed does not mean to infer, if Your Honor looks at page 117 of the appendix, you will see that the trial judge in charging the jury defines an inference for the jury, and that is very different from what it says about presumption on pages 118 and 119, this is not simply an inference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3493.699" offset="14055225">I would totally agree, but the point is that every judge who has considered this case below has taken the position the Sandra Lockett was convicted not because in fact she intended Sydney Cohen’s death, not because the jury could have inferred that but because Ohio law says that if you engage in an armed felony, you are presumed; language in the Court of Appeals’ opinion, that liability is attached to the defendant, ascribe to the defendant, this is not language of inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.669" offset="14179045">This is the language that says the defendant is treated as though she intended killing Sydney Cohen even though she did not and Mr. Chief Justice the answer to the question of what would the jury have done if it had found that she did not intend to kill, the answer to that question is that this jury following these instructions could not have found that she did not intend to kill because if they followed the instructions they were given, they had to find that if she engaged in a plan to participate in armed robbery that she was presumed to intend to kill so this jury could not have acquitted.</text>
