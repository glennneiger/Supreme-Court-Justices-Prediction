            <text syncTime="21.704" offset="166727">First of these cases, Owen Equipment and Erection Company against Geraldine Kroger whose is the administratrix of the estate of her late husband, is here by a way of the grant of a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.676" offset="242691">The question in this case is whether in an action in which federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, the plaintiff may assert a claim against a third party defendant when there is no independent basis for federal jurisdiction over that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.694" offset="314684">The Court of Appeals held in this case that such a claim is within the ancillary jurisdiction of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.105" offset="344359">We granted certiorari because this decision conflicts with several recent decisions of other courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.253" offset="380931">This is not a case very obviously that lends itself to interesting or even intelligible oral announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.110" offset="428369">I will confine myself to saying therefore that for the reasons set out and considerable detail in the court's written opinion filed with the clerk this morning, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.244" offset="476957">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Brennan has joined.</text>
