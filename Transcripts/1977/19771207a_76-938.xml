            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79986">We will hear arguments first this morning in number 76-938 Federal Maritime Commission and others against the Pacific Maritime Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.552" offset="122095">Mr. Friedman you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="13.119" offset="132440">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.767" offset="146964">Section Fifteen of Shipping Act requires persons covered by the Act to file with the Federal Maritime Commission, a category, seven different categories of agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.912" offset="195552">One of which is every agreement controlling regulating preventing or destroying competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.056" offset="220107">Now the commission is instructed by the statute to disapprove agreements that fail to meet certain statutory criteria and to approve all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.289" offset="261067">It is illegal either to carry out either an agreement of that the commission has not approved subject to the Act or one that has been disapproved, and any agreement approved by the commission, thereby obtains antitrust immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.292" offset="329090">There are two questions in this case which is here on a writ of Certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.964" offset="355839">The first one is whether Section Fifteen covers any provision of collective-bargaining agreements, and the second is if that question is answered affirmatively whether the Federal Maritime Commission in this case, properly denied to the particular provisions here involved a labor exemption and exemption that the commission has recognized as appropriate under section 15 for collective-bargaining in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.967" offset="467852">The respondent, the Pacific Maritime Association is an employers association comprised of most of the employees in the west coast Maritime Industry, steam ship companies terminal operators and stevedores.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.449" offset="525739">The respondent International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union is the collective-bargaining represented of the employees in that industry and bargaining on the Pacific West Coast generally take place on an areawide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.151" offset="588538">There are however a small number of employers operating on the west coast who are not members of Pacific Maritime Industry including a number of ports on the pacific west coast, that operate their own terminal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.345" offset="649351">Since 1935, PMA and its predecessors in the Union have operated under a collective-bargaining agreement that provided detail arrangements governing the operation of the waterfront on the west cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.858" offset="711418">The most important aspects of this is that together they have organized in control a joint registered workforce, a force which is registered and which is dispatched under Union hiring halls that are jointly administrated to particular employers on a job basis, the men are rotated, you do not have a particular crew working full time for a particular employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.485" offset="813922">The men are rotated from job to job as the jobs come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.305" offset="837119">The PMA has a very elaborate system of central record keeping and payroll records, everyone is paid centrally even though they work for one employer for two days and another employer for three days of the week, and in addition there is a very extensive jointly operated fringe-benefit program under which they have a guaranteed annual wage, pension plans, welfare plans, vacations plans and so on and all members of PMA are required to contribute to the fund that sustains these fringe-benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.272" offset="977031">Now prior to 1972 which was when the agreement involved in this case was negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.099" offset="1008378">Employers who are not members of PMA could obtain men from registered workforce, Union members by negotiating directly with the local Unions involved in their particular areas and this happened frequently separate contracts were negotiated between many of the ports involved in this case and the local Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.365" offset="1089357">And in addition the individual ports were able to negotiate for the fringe-benefits provided under the master contract by a participation agreement that they negotiated with PMA and the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.271" offset="1149021">And under this arrangement, the Union permitted some of the nonmembers employers to use what they called steady gangs or steady men that is men who worked full time for one employer rather being rotated from individual to individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.434" offset="1217671">PMA was of the view of that the nonmembers use of the registered work force has it functioned put its members the PMA members under what they described as an obvious competitive disadvantage as against the nonmembers.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.865" offset="1283395">And a major reason, PMA's President indicated, page 90 of the record was that under this arrangement if PMA members will close down as result of a labor dispute, the members of the ports who are not members could continue to operate because they were not bound by the arrangements, they were not members of PMA and as result of this cargo and business was diverted from the members of PMA during these periods of labor disturbance to the nonmembers, which they thought was gave the nonmembers, an unfair competitive advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.053" offset="1428113">They also believed that the use of the steady men gave them an advantage and finally they thought that it gave the nonmembers an advantage that they were not required to pay their full share of the fringe-benefits, in the same way the PMA members were, and after extensive bargaining in 1972, PMA and the union agreed upon something called the Nonmember Participation Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.961" offset="1531767">An arrangement that was made a part of the collective-bargaining agreement, and the provisions provides that nonmembers must agree to be bound by the terms of the nonmembers participation agreement as a condition to using the registered work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.654" offset="1598536">Now, we set forth in our brief, a number of provisions at pages 10 and 11 of a brief a number provisions of this nonmember participation agreement, that had an impact upon the nonmembers but there are two of them that I would like to stress at this argument because those are the ones we think that probably have the greatest impact in terms of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.679" offset="1686621">The first thing was that the nonmembers must use the registered workforce upon the same terms as the members which included drawing them off course from the hiring halls which they had been doing in the past and a limited use of them in the case there were Union works stoppages against PMA to the same extent that members of PMA were limited and the non-member participation agreement stated the essence of the this requirement was the acceptance by nonmembers participants of the principle that a work stoppage ILWU against PMA members is a work stoppage against nonmember participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.284" offset="1861119">In other words, if there was a work stoppage against PMA the nonmembers of PMA nevertheless would be bound not to use the work force at the time PMA members were barred from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.832" offset="1919215">The second thing is that the nonmembers who wished to use the registered workforce had to participate in the fringe-benefit plan on the same terms and conditions as PMA members, that is they had to same payments to the fringe-benefit program that PMA members would make.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.231" offset="2004897">After the union and PMA agreed upon this nonmember participation agreement, they endeavored to get the nonmember ports to sign the agreement and they pointed out to the nonmember ports that unless they sign this agreement they would not be able to use the registered workforce and that is set forth at pages 65 and 77 of the appendix.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="506.365" offset="2105416">Mr. Friedman, you referred to nonmember ports and that my understanding is that the PMA consist of steam ship companies, terminal operators, stevedores and so forth, when you say nonmember ports are there entire ports which have none of those – who are members of the PMA?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="530.259" stopTime="558.680">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="530.259" offset="2200920">There are some ports as I understand it where no one is a member, there there are other ports where the port operated facilities are not but there are other facilities in the port that are operated by PMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.315" offset="2249194">PMA, by the way will accept anyone to membership who agrees to its terms but I use this as kind shorthand it is really all nonmembers of PMA who engage in any of these activities but this particular case basically involves the ports.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="562.285" offset="2329024">Primarily yes.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="566.821" offset="2347206">Yes there all public bodies and the public bodies are required under the state Statute to do certain things and do not do certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.066" offset="2380224">The response of the ports to the adoption of this nonmembers participation agreement and the endeavors by the Union and PMA to get them to join it and sign up, was two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.588" offset="2426304">First, they filed a complaint with the Federal Maritime Commission and secondly they file three antitrust cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.083" offset="2452218">Two of those are still pending, the third has been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.793" offset="2467055">The complain with the commission alleged that this nonmembers participation agreements --.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="601.922" stopTime="603.443">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="601.922" offset="2487640">Was the dismissal on merits?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="603.443" stopTime="735.079">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="603.443" offset="2493700">No this was dismissed by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.094" offset="2504358">The records indicates they decided to dismiss its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.849" offset="2515330">And I might add that the antitrust complaint that was dismissed challenge only one narrow aspect of this particular nonmember participation agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.079" offset="2552215">Something dealing with what they call stuffing and unstuffing of the containers at the waterfront and that has dropped out of the case because the National Labor Relations Board has held of that was illegal "hot cargo" clause so that is no longer in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.846" offset="2603310">They alleged that the nonmember participation agreement was an agreement that had to be filed under Section Fifteen and that was an illegal agreement under both Section Fifteen and also several other sections of the act and they urged the board to take jurisdictions of the case and to disapprove the agreements, I am sorry the commission on the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.660" offset="2682618">The commission severed for preliminary determination, two question in the case one whether Section Fifteen covered this agreement and second if it did whether it was entitled to a labor exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.588" offset="2734236">Lengthy affidavits were filed in the case and the basic point the ports made was that the registered work force contains the skilled people necessary to operate these facilities and without the skilled people they could not effectively operate their facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.820" offset="2807170">On the other hand the ports pointed out that if they intended to use nonunion labor if they could get it to do this work the union undoubtedly would throw picket lines around and close down the ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.181" offset="2852623">If on the other hand they singed up under this agreement, it would do two things according to the ports, one it would increase their expenses for variety of reasons and secondly it would turn over control of their labor relations which under their statute they are obliged to handle to third persons because they were bound by doing this -- they would bind themselves to all of the requirements of PMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.685" offset="2942693">The commission held that it has jurisdiction under Section Fifteen over this agreement and that the agreement was not entitled to a labor exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.020" offset="2979996">Now, the commission applied the standards it had developed in the case called Boston shipping to determine the existence of a labor exemption.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="735.079" stopTime="739.580">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="739.580" offset="3038301">No, there is not Mr. Justice but the commission's theory is that since an antitrust exemption results when they approve an agreement under Section 15 and since competitive considerations are a important factor in the commission's administration of Section 15, it is appropriate to imply under statute a labor exemption (Inaudible) for that this Court has developed under the antitrust laws and that is the basic theory upon which the commission operates.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.449" offset="3161704">Mr. Friedman, am I right the commission has not yet either approved or disapproved the agreement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="774.512" offset="3178004">That is incorrect, the all the commission has done is make the threshold determinations that the agreement has to be filed and that is entitled to labor exemption-- and indeed after it makes those determinations, it issued another order setting the issues on the merits for hearing a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.118" offset="3252401">The commission said that this was an agreement which controlled or affected competition between members and the nonmembers and therefore was covered by Section Fifteen and accordingly was applied to the filed unless a labor exemption existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.150" offset="3332544">It found there was no labor exemption for two reasons under two of the criteria it had developed under Boston shipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.667" offset="3358562">First it said, this provision did not relate to a mandatory condition of mandatory subject of bargaining, because it was directed not of the labor conditions of the members of PMA but to the labor conditions of third persons, that is the nonmembers of the ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.742" offset="3434944">In addition the second related issue is since it attempted to impose terms and conditions on people outside of the membership of PMA was in attempting to impose those conditions beyond the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.555" offset="3498161">It concluded that this nonmember participation agreement had a potentially severe and adverse effect upon competition but only a minimal effect on the collective-bargaining process, that is cited on page 70 A of the appendix to the petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.232" offset="5944894">There is no question that some provisions in collective bargaining agreements would have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.560" offset="5966210">In this case the parties agreed to required things to be done by the nonmember ports that would have that impact upon the ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.927" offset="6011663">We think that there is nothing in the language or the Legislative history of the whole scheme of the Shipping Act to indicate that Congress intended a blanket exemption of all collective bargaining agreements from the Shipping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.167" offset="6072580">And what we think is that congress intend the commission in the first instance to take a look at anti- competitive agreements even though they may have been the result of competitive bargaining and that national labor policy is to be implicated not by saying that the Commission has no Jurisdiction over any of these agreements but through the application of the “labor exemption” that the Commission has determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.558" offset="6186161">The “labor exemption” itself in this case that was properly projected by the Commission because as the Commission stated and this is the page 63A of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.060" offset="6244153">The agreement was specifically designed to compel nonmember entities to join PMA under the threat of exclusion from the ILWU workforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.110" offset="6292322">As such it clearly imposes terms and conditions upon persons outside of the bargaining group and this court Pennington recognized so that there is nothing in National labor policy indicating that the union and the employers in one bargaining are the free to bargain about the wages, hours and working conditions of other bargaining units or to attempt to settle these matters for the entire industry and that we think is precisely what this agreement was designed to do, PMA was putting in to Collective Bargaining Agreement with the agreement or the concurrence of the union, provisions designed to eliminate what PMA viewed as unfair competition by its competitive factors in the industry by the nonmember ports and we do not think that the “labor exemption” can be invoked to justify that kind of an agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.456" offset="6585730">I would first like to address myself through the couple of the questions asked by members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.495" offset="6609867">I would like clarify a couple of matters if I do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.861" offset="6623346">Mr Justice Rehnquist asked whether PMA had any members who were ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.729" offset="6658873">Mr Justice Rehnquist request to Mr. Friedman, I am responding to PMA has no members who are public ports at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.459" offset="6693772">There is an application pending by one court to join but public port authorities generally do not employ stevedores, the non-member ports here are an exception, they do not perform stevedoring themselves and therefore they do no employ Longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.272" offset="6756988">So in the normal course a public port is a land lord as in the case of the port of San Fransisco or the port of Los Angles and you do not find them having need to have labor relations with the ILWU and you therefore do not find them becoming members of PMA or otherwise dealing with the ILWU.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.949" offset="6835774">Mr. Justice White asked the question whether it might be the equivalent of approving the agreement, if in the event that the Commission determined that “labor exemption” applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.435" offset="6885720">I would say that is clearly not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.799" offset="6895124">The “labor exemptions” goes to the commission's jurisdiction over the agreements to act one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.770" offset="6919052">A determination -- in fact one of the problems with having the commission in this particular Act is that the determination that an agreement is “labor exempt does not bind any body for the future, certainly anyone who is not a party to this proceeding is free to turn around and file antitrust complaint after the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.696" offset="6990732">So a determination by the Maritime commission that you have a “labor exemption” does not really get you any where in terms of security if you will wish to use that term for the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.289" offset="7161050">As a practical matter that is the last thing in the world you would want to do if you felt that the commission had no business medaling with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.721" offset="7190830">In this case the nonmember ports brought the agreement to the attention of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.707" offset="7206713">We ultimately filed the document because it had to be looked at under the circumstances in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.017" offset="7228028">And normally you would sit it out and wait for someone to complain about it, and you would not go in and file the thing asking for a determination unless you felt that was such a marginal case that you had to do that to protect yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.536" offset="7278079">But normally you would feel that if your agreement was a collective bargaining agreement and not subject to the commission's power to modify, the substance of, to approve, disapprove, regulate after the fact, second guess you, you would vigorously resist that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.260" offset="7537005">I think it would depend on the nature of the question, I mean, for example the Solicitor General referred to the dispute over the container freight stuffing agreement, as the court may be aware this is a monumental subject of labor strife on both coasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.493" offset="7597922">The issue whether Teamsters or Longshoremen stuff of dock containers it has been a subject of very critical recent concerns involved in a tangential where it was involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.179" offset="7648600">That could very well have been a matter under the commissions criteria that could have gotten the Maritime Commission into the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.683" offset="7674618">In that case the non member ports and more particularly cordage companies or other off docks stuffers chose to deal with the matter through a combination of the antitrust Courts by filing a complaint and through NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.818" offset="7719235">It happened that that particular dispute Mr. Chief Justice was resolved by the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.042" offset="7740133">They said it was Hot Cargo clause and knocked it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.834" offset="7755284">One of the problems we have here is potentially, if we have the Maritime Commission in this Act, we have the NLRB which proved itself capable of handling the container freight station stuffing disputes, we have the antitrust courts who have to resolve Pennington Jewel Tea type challenges and now we would also have the maritime commission apparently under some kind of Shipping Act standards and that is very very messy and undesirable way, I submit to you to go about handling this dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.439" offset="7873671">But basically in any one of those forms the way something starts out is by plaintiff having standing coming in and challenging and the decision that forum has to make and if its appealed, the courts on appeal have to make is whether the Federal Maritime Commission or the NLRB or the courts had jurisdiction and I suppose just the fact that more than one of them might have had jurisdiction to adjudicate a particular complaint, it is not inconsistent with the statutory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.346" offset="8009299">Well, I would submit to you that it is inconsistent with the statutory scheme and one of the reasons as a practical matter where I think it is inconsistent is that, in the case of Section 15 unlike the other statutes, you referred to Mr. Justice Rehnquist you have a pre implementation approval requirement and I said to the Chief Justice that in the normal course, if you wish to resist Maritime Commission jurisdiction you would want to take the position, it was not subject and you are not handing it over for filing and some kind of an approval but as a practical matter what if you have one that is fairly close to all fours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.307" offset="8145135">Let us say with one where the maritime commission asserted jurisdiction, as it did for example in the Boston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.819" offset="8167183">Now, there as a collective bargaining group labor and management you are in the position of having negotiated agreement at the eleventh hour perhaps with the strike pending and you are subject to a statute there where if the commission has at least asserting jurisdiction, you are facing possible penalties of a $1000 a day per member for failing to fail the thing even apart from whether it is approvable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.810" offset="8259134">This is not quite what you have asked but in my opinion that is very seriously inconsistent with the policies, labor policies I think it is inconsistent with the way that antitrust courts get in to this particular act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.776" offset="11327059">I should like focus on the questions which have been raised in the preceding arguments from the point of the Labor Organization involved representing the as I do ILWU.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.526" offset="11382020">It was my principal concern in coming here from the West Coast to assure the Court of the legitimacy of the Union's interest in this non member participation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.801" offset="11439176">Perhaps if have read the the reply brief, the solicitor filed before I left for San Francisco, I might have saved myself a trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.735" offset="11466866">Because on page six of this brief and addressing the question of whether the union has that interest in the integrity in work of attorneys and registered work force and in the fringe-benefits of the agreement covers, the solicitor says there is no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.711" offset="11546801">I am quoting him now that the Union has such an interest, indeed he goes on to say that the Union unilaterally could demand from non members of PMA whose employee represents the same terms as that undertook to require under this very agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.134" offset="11612420">It seems to me point number one, with that concession by the solicitor, it is clear that what we have here is a labor contract with the legitimate trade Union interest which bears on the question of whether or not there should be a labor exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.115" offset="11676368">The solicitor however goes on to argue that because as he asserts and he has asserted in his own argument to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.790" offset="11711059">The agreement allegedly imposes conditions on employees of members outside the bargaining units, it therefore falls within the decisions of this Court in Connell and Pennington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.045" offset="11784097">The problem however is, that this case on its facts is different from Kernel and Pennington, what we are talking about here, is a work force of employees who are all in one bargaining unit and who sometimes work for PMA and who very rarely and occasionally work for the non members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.766" offset="11871033">The union represents all of the -- it is not as though, the United Automobile Workers in the Ford Motor Company negotiated a contract to impose conditions on priceless workers, for example, we have a single solitary work force on the West Coast who sometimes work for PMA--</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.663" offset="13010598">In view of the existing institutions on the west coast and they are unique and special institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.621" offset="13030451">It has been indicated in the brief established for the employment of longshoremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.560" offset="13050200">Some agreement, solicitor can some agreement on the access of non members to the joint PMA programs, the joint PMA, ILWU programs and facilities is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.355" offset="13093354">In order this is a jointly controlled work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.179" offset="13112685">The union can not say to the non members you can have the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.257" offset="13136926">It has got to have PMA's consent because it is a joint work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.481" offset="13157824">It is not a union controlled work force, and the solicitor recognizes it therefore some agreement is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.039" offset="13180081">Again, he argues that this agreement is entitled to labor exemption because it is outside the bargaining unit for the reasons I have indicated, we have the very unique situation with respect to what is a bargaining unit here and that is a question that the labor board meets rather than the Federal Maritime Commission need to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.662" offset="13266598">So it is our submission that where the employees involved are common to both sets of employers, you do not have Pennington situation, you do not have a Connell situation where the union represents all of the employees and in Pennington, they did not and in Connell was pointed out in Mr. Justice Powell's opinion, the union not only did not represent the employees, in that case it was not even seeking to represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.223" offset="13380806">Here it represents the employees of both sets of employers where you have got a situation like this, you have got to special kind of a unique labor situation and the Commission was just, the Federal Maritime Commission was, with respect not even unsophisticated to say what the Labor Board might have done or would have done under these circumstances and in attempting to apply this Court and the Labor Board's criteria and its so called distillation of this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.070" offset="13508179">For them, the union was faced as the solicitor concedes in these very negotiations with the proposition that PMA had the right to insist on equality of treatment, on the Most Favored Nation's Clause and if the union had given the non-members anything better than it gave PMA, PMA would have said give to us too and the union would have been whipsawed between two sets of employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.983" offset="13875878">First just a preliminary matter in response to Mr. Justice Stewart's question as to what actually happens if the board grants a labor exemption, I understand if that takes place the Commission would enter a declaratory order to affect that the agreement need not be filed and then dismiss the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.562" offset="13958216">Let me get to what seems to me is as the argument has developed kind of the really the guts of this case, which is whether this is the sort of an agreement that is not properly before the Maritime Commission at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.317" offset="14009207">The suggestion that Mr. Leonard has made is somehow this is a matter to be decided by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.335" offset="14041286">Well Mr. Justice White in your concurring opinion, your opinion in Jewel Tea, you pointed out that the Labor Board is not really equipped to handle these things, there is no way you can get a decision out of the Labor Board, all you can do is file a charge and if the General Counsel decides not to issue a complaint on the charge, that is the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.670" offset="14126654">But more significantly than that, this Court has recognized on not a few occasions more, most recently in the Burlington case, that situations may arise where and cases present issues involving different agencies, in the Burlington case there were problems under the Labor Act and there were problems under the Interstate Commerce Act and this Court said the Interstate Commerce Commission properly considered the problems under its Statute and if something were filed with the Labor Board, the Labor Board would construe it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3557.422" offset="14309615">If somebody thinks that this bargaining unit should now be broadened to include the non-members, they can file something before the Labor Board but it seems to us that the Commission was properly and fully justified in accepting the case as it existed that is, as of now what you have is a bargaining unit consisting of these employees, some of them work for PMA members, most of them do, some of -- case you do not and the PMA members and when you attempt to impose when the union and the employers get together and attempt to impose conditions on people who are not members, those are people outside the bargaining unit and we just do not think --.</text>
