            <text syncTime="13.259" offset="132980">In this the petitioner, the University of Missouri dismissed respondent, Charlotte Horowitz from its Medical School because of academic deficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.773" offset="179060">The decision to dismissal was made by the medical school's council of evaluation after examining for academic performance over a two year period including one year of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.223" offset="228797">She sued petitioners alleging that the university had deprived her of procedural and substantive due process by dismissing her.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.674" offset="262652">The District Court for the Western District of Missouri after a full trial concluded that she had been afforded all rights guaranteed her by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.636" offset="298492">The Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit to what she appealed disagreed holding that she had been denied procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.637" offset="334541">In an opinion filed today with the clerk of the court, we reverse the Court of Appeals, assuming that the respondent had a liberty of property interest and receded the medical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.179" offset="376651">We concluded that the university gave her adequate procedural due process, before the dismissing.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.179" offset="400683">Academic dismissals do not necessitate the same sort of procedures as due disciplinary dismissals.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.493" offset="429940">We also conclude that she was not been deprived of substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.439" offset="449689">Even assuming that Federal Courts can review under narrow standards of the validity of an academic decision by a public educational institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.367" offset="485424">The District Court expressly found that respondent's dismissal was not arbitrary or capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.858" offset="511338">Mr. Justice Powell while joining the opinion of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.878" offset="523459">He has also filed the concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.378" offset="533490">Mr. Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.628" offset="554492">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.656" offset="574554">Mr. Justice Blackmun joined by Mr. Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
