            <text syncTime="66.140" offset="264464">The issue that's presented in the Franks case is one that's troubled the Court for a good length of time, and that is very simply, what is to be done if a search is conducted pursuant to the warrant, pursuant to a search warrant and the affidavit supporting that search warrant just isn't true?</text>

            <text syncTime="105.346" offset="421303">Yes, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.809" offset="427154">It would seem that a warrant should be able to stand on those facts that are in at even the event -- even in the event that there are misstatements within the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.286" offset="473130">And we would all like to believe that the police in the United States simply don't use false affidavits to obtain a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.091" offset="516284">In the present case, however, the petitioner wanted the opportunity to show at trial that certain misstatements were made in the application for a search warrant and the affidavits supporting that application.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.529" offset="586083">We submit that the remedy when the issue comes up, it is to first allow the defendant the opportunity to make such a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.023" offset="628088">And if he does show that in fact the misstatements were made in the search warrant application, then the resulting evidence ought to be excluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.944" offset="795690">The contested allegations in the search warrant affidavit were very simply whether certain conversations took place at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.833" offset="839262">Now, in the absence of those conversations taking the -- taking place, the defendant was prepared to show further that the representations that were behind what allegations were made were erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.824" offset="899239">But the basic issue was the existence or none existence of certain arguments, of certain conversations between the affiant officer and two witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.577" offset="982204">The respondent has argued that if misstatements are shown and that this are material, that the remedy of exclusion is very simply too harsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.197" offset="1028702">They said that Delaware has suggested the benefit of the exclusionary rule of the turned effect is far outweighed by the societal interest in preserving the integrity of orderly criminal law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.215" offset="1084813">We disagree that the remedy of exclusion is too harsh.Certainly, in the case of a substantial misstatement on the part of an affiant, civil prosecution for damages, if they could be assessed, certainly wouldn't be a remedy that be would be too harsh for the affiant involved.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald W. Huntley</label>
            <text syncTime="380.375" offset="1521476">In some circumstances, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.710" offset="1530776">The considerations that should go into the determination of the exclusion of evidence, it seems to me are dictated by two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.796" offset="1571109">First, the fundamental reason for exclusion itself is one of deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.773" offset="1595037">As Mr. Justice White observed in the Stone v. Powell case, when law enforcement officers have acted mistakenly, but in good faith, unreasonable grounds, and yet the evidence they have seized is later excluded, the exclusion can have no deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.353" offset="1669329">We should, in all circumstances, keep in mind what the effect is likely to be in the exclusion of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.308" offset="1701198">Now, turning to the particular situation that Mr. Justice White was addressing, the primary consideration should be whether there will be a substantial deterrent effect in the exclusion of every -- any particular piece of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.994" offset="1775909">Now, to carry this step further, we need to concentrate on the reasonableness of the assumption of the affiant.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.277" offset="1805061">If in fact the evidence that he relies on was false but he had a reasonable basis for believing it to be true, certainly, we aren't going to have any significant benefit from the exclusion of that particular evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.870" offset="3911471">I argue in this case, though, that that wasn't the situation that the only allegations in the search warrant affidavit are related specifically to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.537" offset="3946057">So, that was found in the likelihood of the evidence being in the defendant's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.649" offset="3974583">I've pointed out to the Court what we feel are the basic considerations in excluding evidence obtained to -- pursuant to a search warrant where the affidavit was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.583" offset="4030276">And that is that the evidence should be excluded only when first, there are some reasonable chances that such exclusion could deter the misstatements in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.002" offset="4083984">And secondly, that the misstatements were unreasonable within the specific wording of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.132" offset="4112509">If for example, the basis for the affiant's statements was inaccurate, but at the same time he reasonably believed them to be accurate and there were no courses of inquiry that he should have pursued, as a reasonable man should have pursued, then clearly, his conduct was reasonable and at the same time no deterrent effect can be made by excluding evidence based on reasonable conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.125" offset="4228493">We'd also like to explore the specific circumstances under which the defendant should be allowed to make a showing of inaccurate statements in the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.117" offset="4276454">Both the amicus United States as well as the respondent has suggested that a preliminary showing of some kind be required possibly to the extent of requiring affidavit evidence before this is submitted for a suppression hearing and the defendant given the opportunity to show these inaccuracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.988" offset="4347925">The most frequently advanced argument for this is that it would prevent time-consuming and frivolous exercises at court in search of misstatements when there's no reasonable belief that misstatements actually exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.402" offset="4417515">We suggest that this is not a reasonable apprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.170" offset="4444578">I personally don't have extensive experience in criminal practice, but I rely on the judgment of those of our colleagues that have made a detailed study of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.472" offset="4497868">For example, Professor Grano, in his treatment of this subject, points out that 60% to 90% of all defendants plead guilty, usually without a prior motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.003" offset="4539977">Second, most searches are conducted without warrants, and the defendants in this cases now have full opportunity to file a suppression motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.046" offset="4572160">Third, even in those few cases involving warrants, defendants can obtain a suppression hearing of limited scope, simply by asserting that the warrant's execution was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.064" offset="4612180">Hence, permitting defendants to controvert warrants would increase the present number of supression hearings only insignificantly and merely add the length of some hearings already granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.630" offset="7306449">I would like to discuss Mapp versus Ohio which was the case which made the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule applicable to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.324" offset="7353260">It is to be noted that Mapp was a search without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.881" offset="7371442">The articles seized were contraband, the very subject of the charge, and I think this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.371" offset="7401430">They were testimonial in nature and there appeared to be no alternative remedy for the invasion except a deterrent supression of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.817" offset="7455242">In Stone versus Powell, this Court had occasion to analyze Mapp's application to the exclusionary rule to be founded on, one, the prevention of the introduction of evidence where introduction is tantamount to a coerced confession, two, a deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations, and three, judicial integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.577" offset="7562240">This case is markedly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.176" offset="7580630">The items seized were not testimonial or communicative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.580" offset="7598289">Let's look at what was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.983" offset="7607902">Items of clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.228" offset="7620859">Now, the charges were burglary, rape, kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.449" offset="7641757">These items of clothing had nothing to do with any of the elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.329" offset="7661296">So, I submit, there is no Fifth Amendment overtones, in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.042" offset="7696091">In every other case that I have researched, I find that Fifth Amendment overtones, or Sixth Amendment, are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.179" offset="7736633">Therefore, as this Court has stated in Calandra and -- I believe, in Janis, the exclusionary rule is a judicially created remedy designed to case, safeguard Fourth Amendment rights, generally, through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.808" offset="7847184">Accepting this, then, for this Court to intervene in this case, I submit would be contrary to federalism in allowing the state courts without a constitutional -- A US constitutional point to come before this Court, it would be unjust for this Court to interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.284" offset="7953136">As Justice Clark stated in Kerr versus California and Mapp versus Ohio, we followed Boyd versus US which held the Fourth Amendment, implemented by the self incrimination clause of the Fifth, forbids the Federal Government to convict a man of a crime by using testimony or papers obtained from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.984" offset="8051879">Now, let me point out here that the respondent, in 1950, adopted the exclusionary rule of Weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.583" offset="8102243">And that is so noted in Elkins versus US as one of the States that had adopted the exclusionary rule by means of case law, Rickards versus State , 77 A. 2d 199 (1950).</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.955" offset="8171729">This is prior to Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.236" offset="8180924">Now, our supreme court, the Delaware Supreme Court, in passing on this matter, felt there was no constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.473" offset="8217809">I submit that the Supreme Court of Delaware should be confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.335" offset="8241319">The next point, the application of the defendant for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.842" offset="8291265">The court has discussed it rather thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.559" offset="8302132">They know what it amounts to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.664" offset="8310596">I submit it was merely highly speculative and not a grounds for conducting a hearing.</text>
