          <heading>Opinion Announcement of Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</heading>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="0.000" stopTime="280.159">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79977">Well, I have the opinion, judgment and opinion for the Court to announce in Tennessee valley authority against Hill and I will discuss it only briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.412" offset="133580">This case has been identified as one involving a three-inch fish which on the occasion of the argument, the Attorney General brought to the vector encased in a small flask.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.106" offset="200349">It is a species of the Perch family, which will, according to all the evidence in the case and the findings of the Secretary of the Interior be exterminated if the Tellico dam which is project of the TVA complex is allowed to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.400" offset="285508">The case also involves $120 million dam which was authorized by the Congress and that dam is virtually completed and ready to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.640" offset="342455">In reality, in the view of the majority of the Court, the case involves something more important than either a three-inch fish which is endangered as a species or even then $120 million dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.853" offset="411314">As the majority of the Court sees it, some very important and fundamental principles of the separation of powers are at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.115" offset="448408">Congress has categorically provided that no project may be carried out, may be carried out if it endangers the existence of any species which the Secretary of the Interior declares is endangered and he has done so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.349" offset="529283">We hold then under the established precedence of this Court and under very express and explicit rules of the Congress, an appropriation or continued appropriations do not repeal an express statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.354" offset="601381">In our view, the Congress has, wisely or not, decreed that the endangered species have priority over even a multi-million dollar dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.467" offset="661776">In 1966, in the Endangered Species Act, of that date and again in the 1969 Act, Congress declared that the endangered species were to be protected in effect so far as practicable but in the 1973 Act, which is the statute before us, it very pointedly removed those qualifying provisions, created as we see it, an absolute duty to preserve all endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.626" offset="818406">We emphasize that under the constitution, judges have limited functions and we do not review the solemness or the wisdom of what Congress does and I will read the essence of the opinion, I think, briefly from the opinion itself which is filed this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.842" offset="915268">Our individual appraisal of the wisdom or unwisdom of a particular course, consciously selected by the Congress is to be put aside in the process of interpreting a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.352" offset="969290">Once the meaning of an enactment is discerned and its constitutionality determined, the judicial process comes to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.153" offset="1008578">We do not sit as a committee of review, nor are we vested with the power of Veto and accordingly, we agree with the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit that in our constitutional system, the commitment to the separation of powers is too fundamental and too important for us to preempt congressional action by judicially decreeing what would seem to accord to us as the common sense in the public wheel.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.041" offset="1152042">Our constitution invests all such responsibilities in the political branches and the matter is now is in the hands of Congress.</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="280.159" offset="1200526">I dissent orally because the court's decision is aviate, is quite erroneous and will create serious and far reaching consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.690" offset="1250681">As the Chief Justice has stated, this is the famous snail darter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.399" offset="1269489">The darter is of three-inch pitch, practically indistinguishable from many similar small pitch.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.858" offset="1307314">This has been called a case of a three-inch fish against a $120 million Tellico dam project, a project located on the little Tennessee river.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.132" offset="1356424">Today, the fish wins 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.889" offset="1371471">Although, the dam has been completed and all that remains is to close the gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.487" offset="1397907">This Court will now issue a permanent injunction, a great reservoir project designed to save an impoverished area of Tennessee is ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.721" offset="1446808">This remarkable result comes about in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.496" offset="1465930">The Endangered Species Act adopted in 1973 has a commendable objective of preserving species of animal and plant life and their habitats where they are endangered.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.987" offset="1527892">In the same year, the snail darter was discovered and two years later, in 1975, the Secretary of the Interior found that the Tellico project would result in destruction of the snail darter's habitat.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.767" offset="1598945">In February 1976, when the project was 80% completed, respondents filed this suit to enjoin completion and operation of the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.995" offset="1639905">The district court held that Congress could not have intended to produce such an absurd result.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.165" offset="1668535">The words I use are those of the district court but the Court of Appeals held and this Court now agrees that the Language of the Act requires the result, however absurd it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.425" offset="1725587">It is a language, we are indeed perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.096" offset="1740320">It would be, as the Chief Justice states, the duty of this Court to enforce it regardless of the consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.947" offset="1771667">It is not the province of the judicial branch to rectify policy of political judgments of the legislative branch, however egregiously we may think they discern the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.684" offset="1826628">The issue thus presented to us was one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.973" offset="1851810">Did Congress intend to end federal projects whenever some form of life is endangered by their continued operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.509" offset="1901966">The court thinks that both the language and history of the Act requires this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.213" offset="1924744">It is here that I disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.700" offset="1946687">The statutory language said there is no credit to whoever drafted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.343" offset="1965286">It may be read as the Court reads it but it need not be so read, it may not be read as applying to completed or nearly completed projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.711" offset="2006769">This Court has said on more than one occasion and here I quote that literal application of a statute that would lead to upset consequences is to be avoided whenever a reasonable application is to be -- whenever a reasonable application can be given consistent with the legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.502" offset="2105930">Thus a central inquiry is ascertainment of congressional purpose and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.063" offset="2132157">I think it is plain from the total legislative history that Congress intended no such result as that reached by the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.605" offset="2174370">I review briefly the highlights, the Tellico project was authorized in 1966, 7 years before the Endangered Species Act was adopted and 10 years before the suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.051" offset="2228078">In every year since 1966, Congress has appropriated funds for the construction and completion of this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.875" offset="2267471">Since 1975, the appropriations committees of both houses have been fully advised of the project's effect on the snail darter.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.847" offset="2311357">With all other facts before them, these committees have continued to fund the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.070" offset="2332255">Moreover, in their reports to the Congress, they stated unequivocally that the Act was not intended to halt this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.091" offset="2372274">The committee's recommendations were approved by both houses of Congress and signed in three consecutive years by the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.104" offset="2412294">The Court brushes aside this post-enactment history and relies on contemporary statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.670" offset="2442596">It deems to be supportive of its view, statements adopted at the time that the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.033" offset="2472062">Typical of these statements, if one by a member of Congress emphasizing the importance with which everyone agrees of preserving endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.439" offset="2517724">This Congress then said, that the air force must discontinue bombing practice along the golf coast of Texas, if this endangered the whooping cranes, I would certainly agree with that but there is not even a hint in the legislative history that Congress intended to compel the undoing or abandonment of completed federal projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.904" offset="2619497">No testimony was taken on this possibility, not a single Congressman discussed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.673" offset="2650635">If Congress had been aware that the Act could be used to terminate major federal projects authorized years earlier or to require abandonment of essential federal installations.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.056" offset="2708104">Common sense tells us that there would have been legislative hearings, there would have been testimony, certainly there would have been debate concerning the consequences so wasteful, so inamicable to purposes previously deemed important by the Congress and so likely to arouse public outrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.448" offset="2789711">The absence of any such consideration by the committees or in the floor debate indicates beyond all questions, that no one intended today's consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.440" offset="2841642">These consequences, unfortunately, are not limited to the Tellico project.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.208" offset="2864735">The Court's decision casts a long shadow over the continued operation of even the most important projects, projects serving vital needs of society as well as national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.443" offset="2917711">If continued operation endangers a survival or the critical habitat of a newly discovered species, a water spider or cockroach, operation of the project could be brought to a halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.940" offset="2979673">If Congress acts expeditiously, the Court's decision probably will have no lasting at these consequences but I had not thought it to be the province of this Court to force Congress into otherwise unnecessary action to produce a result no one ever intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.179" offset="3068594">Mr. Justice Blackmun joins me in this dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.009" offset="3079984">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a separate dissenting opinion.</text>
