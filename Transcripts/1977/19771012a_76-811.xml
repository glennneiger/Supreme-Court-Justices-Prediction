            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105720">First case on today's calendar is number 76-811, Regents of University of California against Bakke.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="13.514" offset="159741">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.889" offset="177191">This case here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of California presents a single vital question.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.480" offset="219614">Whether the State -- whether a state university which is forced by limited resources to select a relatively smaller number of students from a much larger number of well-qualified applicants is free voluntarily to take into account the fact that a qualified applicant is black, Chicano, or Asian, or Native American in order to increase the number of qualified members of those minority groups trained for the educated professions and participating individual, professions from which minorities were long excluded because of generations of pervasive racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.497" offset="423682">The answer which the court gives was determined perhaps for decades whether members of those minorities are to have the kind of meaningful access to higher education in the profession which the universities have accorded them in recent years ought are to be reduced to the trivial numbers which they were prior to the adoption of minority admissions programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.988" offset="541651">The three facts realities which dominated the situation that the Medical School of Davis had before it and which I think this control the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.123" offset="598180">The first is that the number of qualified applicants for the nation's professional schools is vastly greater than the number of places available.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.365" offset="643111">That is a fact and an inescapable fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.626" offset="660143">In 1975, 1976, for example, there were roughly 30,000 qualified applicants for admission to medical school, a much greater number of actual applicants and there were only about 14,000 places.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.124" offset="718135">At Davis, there were 25 applicants have received in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.804" offset="740913">In 1974, the ratio was risen to 37 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.815" offset="764946">So the problem is one of selection among qualified applicants, not of ability to gain from a professional education.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.184" offset="818445">The second fact which is no need for me to elaborate but it is a fact for generation's racial discrimination in the United States, much of it stimulated by unconstitutional state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.377" offset="887199">Isolated certain minorities condemn them to unfairer education and shut them out of the most important and satisfying aspects of American life including higher education and the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.110" offset="946131">And the greatest problem is the Carnegie on Higher Education noted more than 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.106" offset="974135">The greatest problem in achieving racial justice was to draw those minorities into the professions that place on important part in our national life.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.181" offset="1022409">And then there's one third factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.707" offset="1032544">There is no racially blind method of selection which will enroll today more than a trickle of minority students in the nation's colleges and professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.883" offset="1085207">These are the realities which the University of California, Davis Medical School faced in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.061" offset="1117913">In which I say I think the Court must face when it comes to its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.220" offset="1138497">Until 1969, the applicants of Davis as it most of the medical schools were chosen on the basis of scores on the medical aptitude test, their college grades, and other personal experiences and qualifications as revealed in the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.313" offset="1218954">The process excluded virtually almost all members of minority groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.598" offset="1248107">Even when they were fully qualified for places because there scores by enlarge were lower on the cognitive test and in college grade point averages.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.284" offset="1294814">Alright, there were no black students and no Chicanos in the class entering Davis in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.198" offset="1326474">If one puts to one side the predominately black medical schools, Howard and Meharry lasted off 1%, eight-tenths of 1% of all medical students in the United States were black in the year 1968, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.385" offset="1391258">In 1969, the faculty at Davis concluded the drawing in the medical college, qualified members of minorities, minorities long victimized by racial discrimination would yield important educational professional and social benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.774" offset="1476731">It then chose one variant of the only possible method of increasing number.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.178" offset="1506406">It established what came to be known as the Task Force Program following the name of then program established by the Association of American Medical Colleges, which would select there were only 50 in the entering class at that time, which would select eight educationally but fully qualified -- select eight educationally or economically disadvantaged but fully qualified minority students for inclusion among the 52 in the entering class.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.762" offset="1856760">So, this was left to the different colleges and very wisely, I think because autonomous institutions, each trying to solve this problem in their own way.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.871" offset="1897198">You may give all of us the benefit of the experience trial and error, creativity.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.500" offset="1919663">That's the virtue of not constitutionalizing the problems in this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.520" offset="1943800">The number was increased to 16 when the size of the class was increased to a 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.988" offset="1969609">And it was the -- this step was taken as part of the movement led by the Association of American Medical Colleges which brought the number of black students studying at predominantly white medical schools from less than 1% to more than 5%, from 211 to 3,000 in a period of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.953" offset="2077442">I want to emphasize that the designation in 16 places was not a quota at least as I review is that were.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.174" offset="2122373">Certainly it was not a quota in the older sense of an arbitrary limit put on the number of members of the non-popular group who would be the admitted to an institution which was looking down its nose at.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.864" offset="2201158">I think that it limited the number of non-minority and therefore essentially white, yes, but there two things to be said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.578" offset="2247970">One is that this was not pointing the finger at a group which had been marked as inferior in any sense and it was undifferentiated that operated against a wide variety of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.271" offset="2306798">So I think it was not stigmatizing in the sense the (Inaudible) was stigmatizing in any way.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.086" offset="3925971">Well, I point it of course that was -- it's because the purpose of the athletic and social purposes of an undergraduate school are different for those of professional schools that I'm frank from pressing the analogy too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.969" offset="3985531">Although, I think it's logical accurate and that it helps ones thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.200" offset="4002458">Well, the proofs of the objectives of undergraduate education are somewhat broader, somewhat harder to define.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.264" offset="4046762">On the other hand, it's clear to me that the inclusion of minorities and undergraduate college may be at least as important as that a professional school.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.529" offset="4091797">And the date of course they're got to get to professional school they have to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.886" offset="4109247">But I think when -- I think one finds that the objectives of these programs apply in large part to undergraduate colleges as well as professional schools, certainly the objective of improving education through greater diversity or is perhaps even more important than an undergraduate school that it is in professional school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.492" offset="4223663">But I wouldn't minimize its importance of the professional school and I would emphasize its important when it comes to membership in the professions, so that the professions will be aware of all segments to the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.320" offset="4282909">I think the objective of breaking down isolation which is one of the greatest problems of achieving racial justice in this country is served by including minorities I would say about equally involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.188" offset="4358455">The objective that impresses itself on my mind, partly because Dean Lowrey testified it, and partly because I am at least in part an educator is the importance of including young men and women at both undergraduate colleges and the medical schools, so that the other younger boys and girls may see, yes, it is possible for a black to go to University of Minnesota or to go Harvard or Yale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.701" offset="4496486">I know Johnny down the street and I know Sammy's father, he became a lawyer and John's father became a doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.606" offset="4536087">This is essential if we're ever going to give true equality in a factual sense to people because the existence or non-existence of opportunities and surely we all know shapes people's aspirations when they're very young, it shapes the way they behave, it shapes in a most pedagogical sense, I suspect whether they do or don't read a book in the afternoon whether they do or don't read at school.(Voice Overlap)</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.583" offset="5012038">I would say that as the number goes up, the danger of invidiousness or the danger that this is being done not social purposes but to favor one group as against another group, the risk if you will of a finding of an invidious purpose to discriminate against is greater and therefore I think it's a harder case but I would have to put the particular school in the context of old schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.184" offset="5158429">There are programs of which are designed for example to train Indians, to go back and teach at Indian reservations and nobody else is talking those programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2507.607" offset="10136113">First, the minorities are only a minor fraction of all disadvantaged.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.614" offset="10304133">The other suggestion that has been made is that we should not use the word race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.276" offset="10326807">We should talk about choosing people for admission to medical colleges who are most likely to go to those communities that have been the victims of discrimination and the need better medical care.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.589" offset="10796071">The interest of the United States of America is amicus curiae stands from the fact that the Congress and the executive branch have adopted many minority sensitive programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.148" offset="10854272">They take race or minority status into account in order to achieve the goal of equal opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.851" offset="10885096">The United States is also concluded that voluntary programs to increase the participation of minorities in activities throughout our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.148" offset="10930236">Activities previously close to them should be encouraged and supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.881" offset="10953224">Accordingly, it asks this Court to reject the holding of the Supreme Court of California if race or other minority status may not constitutionally be employed in affirmative action and special admissions programs properly designed and tailored to eliminate discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities as such discrimination exist today or to help overcome the effects of past years of discriminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.490" offset="11091673">This Court does not require a recital of the extent in duration of racial discrimination in America from the time it was enshrined in our very Constitution in the three-fifths comprise, in the fugitive slave provision and in the provision preventing the importation of such persons prior to1808.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.757" offset="11212672">And it continues until the present day as the over burden dockets of the lower federal courts and indeed of this Court will indicate where there's been non-compliance with the decisions of this Court that it rediscovered and are still rediscovering the true genius of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.312" offset="11310892">Indeed, many children born in 1954, when Brown was decided are today 23 years later the very persons knocking on the doors of professional schools seeking admission about the country that they are persons who in many instances have been denied the fulfillment of the promise of that decision because of resistance to this Court's decision that was such a landmark when it was handed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.708" offset="11448505">And this discrimination has not been limited just to persons of African ancestry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.403" offset="11479330">We all know too well the Asian Exclusion Acts that have discriminated against Asian-American citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="3883.487" offset="15639591">We have no contention here that Allan Bakke has a constitutional right or even a statutory right to be in a medical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.574" offset="15675953">As a matter of fact, I am sure that if the Regents of the University of California had decided to close the medical school at Davis that Allan Bakke couldn't stand up here through his lawyer or even get beyond the first demurrer in the superior court of Woodland and say I have a right to go to the medical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.789" offset="15752858">That is not Allan Bakke's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.705" offset="15764456">Allan Bakke's position is that he has a right and that right is not to be discriminated against by reason of his race and that's what brings Allan Bakke to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.213" offset="15814507">Now, let me go on for just a moment with what happened in the lawsuit because it's very important that we follow this step by step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.843" offset="15848989">The University at the very beginning did several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.538" offset="15863826">First, they denied that it was -- that they had a racial quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.471" offset="15879604">I think that's disappeared from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.053" offset="15889844">Secondly, they denied that Mr. Bakke would have been admitted even have there been no racial quota and as I will indicate at some length I hope later on, that's disappeared in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.401" offset="15943238">They admitted, speaking of the scope of Section 2000 (d), they admitted that they were a federally funded institution but they did more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.964" offset="15997573">They did more that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.696" offset="16004469">They then filed a cross-complaint against Allan Bakke and within the cross-complaint, they sought their own kind of relief and the relief which they sought was the relief that their program be declared constitutional, not only constitutional buy constitutional within the federal sense and within the California sense and something else, that it also be declared constitutional within the meaning of 2000 (d), that is Title VI and so the issue was joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.109" offset="16146053">Now, bear in mind, bear in mind the whole scope of what we're talking about in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.628" offset="16172176">Here we are in September -- in June of 1964, we filed a complaint, the name of the game is not to represent -- is not to represent Allan Bakke, as a representative of a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.377" offset="16231212">We are not representing Allan Bakke as a representative of some organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.794" offset="16256812">This is not an exercise in a law review article or a bar examination question, this is a question of getting Mr. Bakke into the medical school and that's the name of the game and we have to do that in order to be effective as lawyers and we humbly tried to be effective as lawyers, sometime between June of 1974 and the entering class of September of 1974 and if you read the record, you will see the frantic efforts we make to get before the Court and we tried to get before the Court on a question of injunction, on a questions of mandamus, on a question of a declaratory relief, each of them moving the thing forward on the calendar.</text>

            <text syncTime="6413.036" offset="25757860">Yes, and what we are saying in that regard -- what we are saying in that regard that on the facts of this case, there was no non-minority person in any of the years covered by the statistics here that was ever admitted to the special admission program.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.948" offset="25841452">There was no definition of what was meant by educationally or economically disadvantaged and what I said before and I repeat now is that in the very two years that Mr. Bakke applied, there were 245 people who were deemed by the school to be white economically disadvantaged who tried to get into the program, more than a third of those who tried and not in.</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.471" offset="25955555">And I also called to the Court's attention one other fact, that in the year 1973 when the application was handed out, the application said, are you applying as a member of a disadvantaged group, economically or educationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="6479.621" offset="26024100">That was not the question in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="6483.425" offset="26039356">In 1974, the school had gone to the MCAT system which is the general application system used by half the medical schools in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6495.123" offset="26086167">The question in 1974 which triggered consideration by the special admissions group was this, are you applying as a member of a minority group?</text>
            <text syncTime="6505.491" offset="26127650">So on its face, on its face the program becomes not even the pretense of a disadvantaged group, the program becomes a program which is designed as a racial proposition and that is what Mr. Bakke is complaining of, it is that which deprives Mr. Bakke of his full opportunity to 100 places in the class.</text>

            <text syncTime="6554.809" offset="26324927">We have argued back and forth through the trial court and through the Supreme Court the question of burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6561.332" offset="26350944">Did Mr. Bakke have the burden of proving that he would have qualified or to the University at the burden of proving that he would not have qualified?</text>
            <text syncTime="6569.854" offset="26385113">The original decision of the Supreme Court of California was a decision which said -- which agreed with this finding, and said, yes the burden of proof is on the University.</text>
            <text syncTime="6583.784" offset="26440806">It's a -- it's a -- just like Franks versus Bowman Transportation, once you prove the discrimination, then the University has to prove that Mr. Bakke would not have been admitted even there though there had not been no such quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="6602.441" offset="26515411">And the University then entered into a petition for rehearing and in the petition for rehearing, it entered into a stipulation and the stipulation is filed before the California Supreme Court and the stipulation is very brief, very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6621.069" offset="26589913">It is hereby stipulated by the Regents of the University of California (the University) that it has produced all of the evidence available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6630.540" offset="26627842">On the question of whether Mr. Bakke's failure to be admitted for the class -- entering the School of Medicine at the University of California Davis in September 1973 resulted from the operation of the Special Admissions Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.037" offset="26685834">The University concedes that it cannot the meet the burden of proving, the Special Admissions Program did not result in Mr. Bakke's failure to be admitted and without your taking your time, I will tell you that this is carried over to the petition for hearing, the stipulation is in exhibit to it and then the California -- the University says, the University has produced all of the evidence it has on the question and concedes as set forth in the attacked stipulation of Donald L. Reidhaar that it will not attempt to meet that burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6682.761" offset="26836718">Mr. Bakke was a highly qualified applicant and came extremely close to admission in 1973 even with the special admissions program being in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6694.000" offset="26881648">It cannot be clearly demonstrated that the special admission program did not operate to deny Mr. Bakke admission in that year and then upon receipt of the petition for rehearing with the stipulation attached to it, the California Supreme Court then did the logical thing instead of remanding the matter to Woodland and Yolo County for Judge Macar (ph) to make this determination and ordered Mr. Bakke into the medical school, he is presently ordered into the medical school and where it not for the stay in this case of course, he would be in the medical school.</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="6749.830" stopTime="7017.275">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="6749.830" offset="27104943">I do not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="6751.169" offset="27110376">I disagree and I develop the reasons if I may that was one of the points that I plan to address myself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6761.021" offset="27149769">I think perhaps I can be most helpful by trying to put the very particular points we covered in my argument, within a larger framework of my basic thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="6780.660" offset="27228345">The first main proposition that I would assert is that the racially conscious admissions program at Davis and any racially conscious admissions program designed to increase the number of minorities to their profession school, is fully consistent with both the letter and the spirit of the Fourteenth Amendment and I simply want to add one footnote to say that when I use the word race or racially conscious, I'm not speaking of race the way one would speak of a red-headed man, or a man that has some other mark that is sheer happenstance, that isn't the quality of race in our society today, and I'm really talking about all the things that have gone with race and the remnants of those things in terms of current soulful problems, that race is a shorthand for expressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.021" offset="27477762">Now, that main proposition the way it would develop and I'd simply state them in three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="6850.918" offset="27509318">We say first that there is no perceived rule of color blindness incorporated in the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6859.639" offset="27544218">We say second that the educational, professional and social purposes accomplished by a race conscious admissions program are compelling objectives or to put it practically, they are more than sufficient justification, for those losses, for those problems that are created by the use of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.425" offset="27639408">We don't minimize them but we say that the cost is greatly outweighed by the gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="6889.962" offset="27665531">And third, as I said my argument, we submit that there is no other way of accomplishing those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6900.111" offset="27706073">Now, this brings me to the point that the Supreme Court of California was wrong, that its judgment should be reversed because it said that under present circumstances, we may not take race into account, that's what Mr. Colvin pitched his case on, that's the proposition he presented below, he presented here, Justice Powell, he doesn't need any more facts on then.</text>
            <text syncTime="6926.009" offset="27809727">He's either right or wrong as a matter of constitutional law or a statutory law if he goes back to the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6933.742" offset="27840656">There is a further question, is there something about the use of the number 16 that renders this program peculiarly valid?</text>
            <text syncTime="6948.375" offset="27899170">There are a lot of educational institutions that pursue minority admissions program but the admissions committee has instructed to get a good number, get a substantial number, get within the range of 10 to 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.060" offset="27969909">Now, we submit that the method of putting the general policy into actual practice, the level at which somebody reduces into numbers is not a matter of constitutional dimension and for like reason, we say that the questions raised in the Solicitor General's brief are not matters of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="6995.451" offset="28087460">They are details of admission programs and in both instances we urge that the -- this Court should not get the lower federal courts into being the supervisors of the admissions policies of certainly state and perhaps private institutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="7017.275" offset="28174814">You wouldn't say that if the admissions committee suddenly decided that they wouldn't admit any black people.</text>

            <text syncTime="7024.168" offset="28202295">No, but I'm suggesting that the details to which I was addressing myself where of a different order of magnitude, you have to decide whether we are right in saying that race may be taken into account for proper purposes, of course you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="7041.837" offset="28273034">I do stress and even with respect to the main question but I think it's more important as one gets down to what I regard as detail such as this specific number.</text>

            <text syncTime="7056.364" offset="28331131">One is the judicializing or constitutionalizing, the drawing of courts in, the writing of monolithic rules tends to dampen one of the great -- abandon one of the greatest sources of creativity in this country the opportunity in dealing with delicate sensitive and often painful.</text>
            <text syncTime="7083.785" offset="28440845">It's not easy to turn down young men and women, and in dealing with those problems, we are wise to take advantage of the fact that there are 50 states, were wise to take advantage so far as the legislatures will allow it, of the fact that different campuses or different faculties are allowed to make up their own minds, and I think that to set a lot of rules that would draw the federal courts into scrutinizing the details of what is done would invite constant litigation and as I say it would abandon a source of creativity, it would destroy important autonomy in wrestling which with I argued and I'm sure all court recognize as an extraordinarily sensitive and difficult problem but a search for justice to all to which this country has always been committed and to which I'm sure is still is.</text>
