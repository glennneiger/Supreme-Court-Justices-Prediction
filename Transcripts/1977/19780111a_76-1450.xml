            <text syncTime="31.946" offset="207690">This is an appeal from the criminal convection of the publisher of a newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.658" offset="226602">The crime for which it has been convicted and fined is the publication by the newspaper of a name of a judge, a judge against whom charges had been filed before the Virginia Inquiry and Review Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.717" offset="282818">The article on question was printed on October 1975 by the Virginian-Pilot and Norfolk newspaper which was printed by Landmark.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.538" offset="326076">The report in the article was in all relevant respects inaccurate.</text>

            <text syncTime="69.851" offset="359304">The article referred to then identify a judge who had been investigated by Commission, a Virginia Commission established to investigate charges, which could be the bases of retirement at censure or removal from the Bench.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.946" offset="539758">The news article stated that no formal compliant had been made by the Commission in the Supreme Court of Virginia, and it stated that that indicated that the Commission either had filed insufficient cause for action or that the case was still under review by the Commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.014" offset="620006">A month after the article was printed Landmark was indicted and charged under Section 2. 1-37. 13 of the Virginia Code with the crime of having unlawfully divulged the name of a judge at a time when the judge was the subject of an investigation and hearing by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.690" offset="702762">Under the section of law under which Landmark was accused of violating, all papers filed with the Commission and testimony before it are required to be confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.160" offset="740587">Any person who divulges, and that is the statutory language, information in violation of the Section is guilty of a misdemeanor, a crime punishable in Virginia by a prison sentence of up to a year and up to $1,000 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.618" offset="794400">At trial the only evidence introduce by the Commonwealth other than the article itself was a stipulation of evidence entered into by the Commonwealth and Landmark, which stated the Landmark had printed the issue in question that the Virginian-Pilot had published the October 4 article, that the article had identified a judge who had in fact been investigated by the Commission, and that at the time the article was published the Commission had not filed a formal complaint concerning the judge with the Supreme Court of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.775" offset="919056">The latter part of the stipulation, I think it maybe set it verdict to the fact that under Virginia law once a formal charge is filed with the Supreme Court of Virginia everything about the proceeding which is filed does becomes then public.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.412" offset="977570">No other evidence was offered by the Commonwealth at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.310" offset="993139">At the trial Landmark urged that properly and constitutionally construed, the Statute should be held to apply to the first disclosure of information by a participant involved in the proceeding itself, but not to the later publications by a newspaper of information learned by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.489" offset="1069939">Landmark urged as I urged today that to apply the statute to it for publication of a news article identifying a judge would violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.418" offset="3349593">When a Virginia Judge allegedly dismissed his law clerk or a law clerk who was testified against him before the Commission and that allegation was contained AP Wire Service Dispatch which went throughout the country and into Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.429" offset="3417616">That story could be only printed by Landmark because one federal judge in Richmond had previously entered and award enjoining enforcement of the statute against Richmond newspaper on First Amendment grounds, and because another federal judge in Arthur (ph) entered a temporary restraining order enjoining prosecution of Landmark for printing what the Richmond paper has printed with respect to the subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.433" offset="3553662">It seems to me important to make clear also at the outset what this case does not involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.099" offset="3584382">This is not an access case, the question is not raised before you today and we have made no claim in this case of a First Amendment right of access to the Commission proceedings before our claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.976" offset="3719905">The case, of course, does not deal that this Court’s recent Nebraska ruling did with issues relating to a fair trail and the Sixth Amendment and First Amendment right kept in some kind of act before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.052" offset="3780196">And the case does not deal with any kind of limitation on a conduct as opposed to free expression or any kind of limit as to time, place, or manner of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.684" offset="3818648">This is, if the Court please, a classic rather old-fashioned first Amendment case in which I think we may return to first principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.253" offset="3856996">This is a case which raises at the outset at least, the question of whether a law does or does not abridge freedom of the press when it makes criminal the truthful printing of facts about public officials where they need to their public duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.438" offset="3917704">In our view the very notion, that such kind of publication may be made criminal is upon to be permitted constitutional principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.970" offset="4135879">How then can a truthful report about an official proceeding relating to the confidence of a public official be made a criminal offence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.531" offset="4234099">Such an explanation, I may respectfully say so, would be an all too familiar one throughout most of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.967" offset="4259804">That is unfamiliar one, I suggest, for a state to offer in this Court, and it is one which might leave in defense any seditious liable statute in just so many words, including the alien and traditional laws themselves, and even that disasteric relic of our history permitted truth to be stated as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.605" offset="4346321">The reasons offered by the Supreme Court of Virginia for requiring confidentiality are real ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.211" offset="4372757">They may well been proper as regard participants before the Commission itself, but they for sure of any which could conceivably permitting (Inaudible) and to First Amendment rights by way of criminal punishment for publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.817" offset="4431167">The Supreme court of Virginia relies first on the question of the reputation of the judge who was accused by a complaint before the Commission, and the reputation of the judiciary, in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.986" offset="4483934">But this Court has already concluded in New York Times against Sullivan and elsewhere that injury of official reputation forwards no more want for the repressing speech that would otherwise be free than this factual error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.752" offset="4542971">And in fact, the Virginia Statute as the Chief Justice’s question earlier suggests does permit as much harm at assistance to judicial reputation since it makes criminal publication of the fact that a judge’s reputations has been cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.635" offset="4606501">There is also the need asserted in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Virginia to protect complaints and witnesses from retributions by judges against whom they offered testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.136" offset="4656447">Now this case, I should say, does not involve such a situation at all, since all that is involved here, the only claim made here in the indictment is that Landmark unlawfully revealed the name of a judge under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.995" offset="4715902">Well, but the statute does not even provide full protection for witnesses surely, and indeed under the statutory language, once a claim is filed, Once a complaint is filed before the Supreme Court of Virginia by the Commission, the judge against whom it is filed receives full access to the testimony against him, as he should, and I suppose, at least I would argue constitutionally --</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.390" offset="4997502">Now we do have an instance referred to, which I referred to earlier, of a court clerk, at least this is what it alleged in the papers in the case filed by the court clerk, in which a court clerk has alleged that as a result of her making charges against the judge for whom she worked, she was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.570" offset="5106276">I think the question does arise as to whether a court clerk or witness is better protected by being able to have the benefits of publicity in a situation in which she fears retribution or alleges retribution than to be deprived that the chance to have anything said about her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.436" offset="5189659">In short, what I am saying is that I understand that there is an argument that a statute, such as this, by keeping things confidential, helps to protect witnesses in that period prior to a charge is being filed, that there is a counter argument that there are situations in which witnesses are as well protected by publicity at least when they wanted, and this statue prevents that kind of publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.316" offset="5289237">And in any event, as I have said, that is not really raised, as I view it, by this case since that justification for the criminal punishment on Landmark -- is no justification for criminal punishment of Landmark, since what is involved here is not the disclosure of a witness’ name.</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.576" offset="5430299">Whereas if the name of the judge is disclosed, he knows there has been an investigation, he knows there is one likely person who has been his enemy throughout his life who probably said something to Commission, there is then created a danger or retaliation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.917" offset="8771569">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.821" offset="8791213">On behalf of Commonwealth Virginia I would like to tell this Court that the questions and issues in this Court are easy or ones which the Commonwealth had not wrestled with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.229" offset="8856832">But, I would say that the circumstances and the facts of this case come to this Court are the quite different circumstances than other case which had been ruled upon from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.438" offset="8913675">I speak for example cases where, such as Oklahoma Publishing Company and Cox Broadcasting Company where this court has said -- and we did not make any contention otherwise -- that once information is placed in the public domain, there is absolutely no prohibition for being made public or being published in the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.327" offset="9037286">Also, additionally in those cases where the Court has, in Bridges versus California; in Pennekamp versus Florida; in Craig versus Harney; in Wood versus Georgia, where there were statements or criticisms printed about the judges in the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.369" offset="9117430">We again say that the factual situation of this case is greatly different from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.053" offset="9144179">On the basis that the information which was published in those articles occurred in the public domain and this Court said specifically that there were no legislative prior enactment which would give this Court any guidance as to the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.962" offset="9231846">Now we submit to the Court that in this case, we have not only a legislative intent but we have the intent manifested by the both of the people or Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.707" offset="9286808">I would like to go just into a little bit of history as to the reasons for the enactment of this particular statute on consideration today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.884" offset="9327454">Prior to the enactment of the Constitution in 1971, Virginia had the ways of removal of a unfit of a judge or one who was guilt of misconduct, the provisions of impeachment, there was also the situation in Virginia in that judges are elected by the legislature for different periods of time depending on whether they are justices of state supreme court and on down (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.254" offset="9445005">So at each time when the legislature would meet to consider the reappointment of the judge, of course, that presented an opportunity for information to be given as to his character, his fitness or his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.690" offset="9510730">For over 200 years in the Commonwealth of Virginia there is not a single reported case wherein a judge was removed from office by impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.028" offset="9560049">The citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia recognized that there must be some better way in order to effectively and efficiently deal with errant judges, judges who are becoming senile or other physical incapacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.878" offset="9643432">Virginia has been looked what other states were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.584" offset="9662240">California, I think is a leading state in this area where they enacted legislations setting up a Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.470" offset="9713858">One of the cornerstones in the hallmark of that legislation was decided to be by Judge Neely of California who was a former chairman of the California Commission is that the confidentiality of this proceedings is a necessary component in order to effectively administer the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.688" offset="9818661">Forty states including Commonwealth Virginia, and two Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia all have made provisions either by constitutional mandate or by statutory mandate to set up a review commission of the nature and type of the Commonwealth Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.954" offset="10575794">History and experience has so shown all of the legal items, every court that has decided the case, every state that has taken a look at it has come up with the same exact conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.173" offset="10640682">That was a recent study of attorneys, for example, and they said without the equivocation that they would not make complaints against sitting judges if they had any question that their names would be divulged as the original complainant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.426" offset="10725632">I think it goes without saying that it would be very difficult for a judge who is sitting in the same circuit with another judge to make a complaint and that his name be brought into the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2985.016" offset="12020052">And as I have indicated, the Supreme Court of Virginia said that what the stature attempts to do is to protect the complainants and witnesses until such time as the Commission has found sufficient background and sufficient justification to bring a formal complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.106" offset="12100405">As Mr. Justice Stevens was mentioning a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.468" offset="12117854">We know for example, the reports are from California, that well over I think about two thirds at least 50% of two thirds somewhere in that neighborhood of the complaints are found to be initially frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.334" offset="12181280">Now, if we did not have and did not provide for confidentiality, the names of these people who made these complaints in good faith, the names of any people who may have been called upon to give testimony in the preliminary stages, all of their names would be subject to being released.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.886" offset="12331536">That has been certainly the practice in California particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.781" offset="12359121">They make the report and they have shown that prior to the attempt they have never had any formal hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.045" offset="12384094">That once the Commission -- and I want to make that clear -- it is the Commission that makes a complaint against the judge, the initial complainant simply files his papers with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.731" offset="12434876">The commission at that point then makes its investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.162" offset="12448565">If they find that the complaint is justified or at least has merit then they are the ones that been the contacting of the judge and so they take it over at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.668" offset="12506661">So, I would say to the Court also in this case while Virginia does not normally publish the results as they do in California about how many complaints have been filed and how many judges may have resigned prior to the time coming to the Supreme Court of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.331" offset="12605299">In the report which is the subject of this particular case the report filed by Landmark, the publication they do have from Mr. Bakeman who was one of the members -- it is Page 47-A of the Appendix shows the original new article, and it does show that Mr. Bakeman did indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.191" offset="12716685">It says when asked via one case that had ever been referred to Supree Court, Bakeman said, Mr. Bakeman being a member of the Commission “several judges did resign a number have retired or something like that.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3788.422" offset="15233636">Let us say 20 years later some historian stumbled upon this information and were then to divulge it, if we sustain the statute he then be guilty of the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3797.121" offset="15268431">Yes sir, I would have to say that that is true, because the statute provides that all confidential materials of the Commission must be files in the confidential files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.598" offset="15314302">But, I would say this Mr. Justice Stevens is that there is provision in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.817" offset="15343245">And, I think this answers some of the criticism of the statute by saying, suppose that we had a corrupt commission which I find to be an extreme state of affairs to say that this commission all would be corrupt, but, assuming that there were for a moment, it does provide that members of the legislature may request and the Commission may release the information to the legislature when the reappointment of a judge is to be reconsidered by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.974" offset="15475843">And we take a position that if the legislature does in fact ask for the information and releases it, then it becomes in the public domain and it would not fall under the strictures of this particular section for the same reasons that I believe that the Court was talking about in Cox Broadcasting Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.695" offset="15578765">In other words, once the state itself releases the information and puts it into the public domain, then there is no right to suppress it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3910.795" offset="15723170">One is that we think that the Commission has answered the problem which Virginia citizens have foreseen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.377" offset="15769459">As I have indicated previously for the 200 years where impeachment and others types of removals were available, there was not a single removal of any judge for any mental disability, any incompetence, any malfeasons (ph) in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.109" offset="15844379">Since 1971, when the Constitution was enacted by the people providing for the Commission, and since the Commission was specifically then thereafter set up by legislation in 1971, the Commission has taken action which had been reported to the Supreme Court of Virginia, which has been reported to the citizens of the Commonwealth, which has been reported by the press, one judge has been removed from office and three other judges have been publicly censored for activity which has an effect on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.369" offset="15997456">So I would say that that is where the public interest lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.544" offset="16014174">The public interest lies in being able to effectively handle these types of problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="4138.229" offset="16632859">No sir, but I think though that -- the point I am trying to make Mr. Chief Justice is that here we have a situation in the article itself which is published -- and this in the Appendix on Page 47-A -- shows that once they get this initial information they went around to the Commission members, they went around to purported witnesses, they went around to the judge himself, and attempted to cajole out of them information which they say that the State has, at least I take it, they are saying the State has a right to keep confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.094" offset="16800356">I see the position of the newspaper, they are saying, well, if we can get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.750" offset="16822925">That is one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.379" offset="16825433">It is a right for you to try to keep it confidential, but if we can get it, then it is a right for us to publish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.602" offset="16846331">And I submit that that just applies in the phase of what we think of as a civilized society.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.119" offset="16876424">We say on the one hand, that the government cannot go about inducing innocent people to commit crimes, such as entrapment, for example, but again in this case, and the article shows in fact they tried to do it, tried to get honest public citizens of Commonwealth Virginia to breach their confidentiality and witnesses do not even say that you even talk to me because I am not to tell you anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.319" offset="17005260">and he did not tell them anything, but apparently some did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="4235.074" offset="17020202">But, even if you can show that some of these press reporters paying $50 or $100 to a clerk in the Commission’s office to get it, it would not have any bearing on the issue now before this Court, would it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.001" offset="17079970">That is another problem, a separate distinction, isn’t it?</text>

            <text syncTime="4255.001" offset="17099928">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not know whether it is or not, because if you draw a distinction and say, well, if they did not get it in a unlawful criminal way that may be one thing, but if they do it is another thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.522" offset="17161995">I do think there can be distinctions drawn in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4273.206" offset="17172757">But your case, in any means of getting it is unlawful because, using it is may become an act State of Virginia, by the Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="4283.557" offset="17214135">Well, but I believe Mr. Chief Justice, because in other words if the complainant and the witnesses and those people who are involved in the proceedings, and the Commission rules themselves which are referred to and they printed in point 215 of Virginia Reports say specifically that they advise every participant of the confidential nature of the matter and that it is a crime to divulge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.973" offset="17331895">And all I am saying is that here we have the press going out, attempting to get otherwise honest citizens to breach an oath to breach the confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.091" offset="17376303">And I submit that therefore it puts it in a different context.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.825" offset="17391245">And, I would close by saying that I think in the last analysis the issue in this case is whether the people of Virginia, in passing the Constitution of 1971 and their elected officials by enacting the statutes in question, may constitutionally determine that certain matters of public interest are to kept confidential or is that decision to be made by an unelected and unnamed editor of some newspaper.</text>
