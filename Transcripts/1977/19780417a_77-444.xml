            <text syncTime="64.709" offset="339108">Not Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.211" offset="353110">In addition, 20 civic organizations which are all highly respected, and finally, the United States has had sufficient interest not only to file a brief but to participate in argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.936" offset="391980">But I am not so intimidated because the position that I put to you here on behalf of Penn Central rests on the bill of rights, that great charter of liberties, which serves as a protection against all government, not just bean-old government but even the best-intentioned government.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.008" offset="452271">In addition, I would suggest that the unusual display of public interest here serves to emphasize a principal element in Penn Central’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.603" offset="486648">That is the enormous public benefit which is claimed will be brought about by the governmental action that we challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.364" offset="513711">As a result of actions taken by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission pursuant to the city’s Landmarks Law, Penn Central has been prohibited from constructing an office building over the Grand Central Terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.747" offset="559268">Now that prohibition has been imposed by the city, not because such a building would be unsafe or uneconomic or in violation of zoning regulations, but solely to assure that all who live in New York and all who visit New York will have an unimpeded view, an unrestricted enjoyment of the terminal, a structure which the Commission found to be a magnificent example of French Beaux Arts architecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.675" offset="658951">After the terminal had been designated as a landmark by a Commission of 11 private citizens reporting generally to the Board of Estimate, three separate efforts were made under the guidance of internationally known architect, Marcel Breuer to persuade the Commission in accordance with its procedures that an office building could be constructed without impairing the integrity of the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.453" offset="746096">All three were rejected and it is now common ground among the parties that Penn Central stands affectively precluded from constructing a building over the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.731" offset="787160">The record discloses that in return for the use of the air rights over the terminal, Penn Central would receive from a developer who would bear all the risks of constructing the building, $1 million a year during construction and thereafter, a minimum of $3 million a year escalating as rental collections increase.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Gribbon</label>
            <text syncTime="215.769" offset="943268">Which is large to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.944" offset="956016">I say, therefore, that there can be no doubt that the city’s action has deprived Penn Central of something of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.476" offset="978168">While the city recognizes that Penn Central has been denied the right to construct an office building which it is entitled to do, otherwise under applicable zoning regulations the city refuses to acknowledge that air rights constitute a form of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.714" offset="1031040">It even suggests that the use of the term is something of a semantic trick.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.438" offset="1045982">Such rights, however, have been widely used, sold, utilized for 50 years and the Court of Appeals did not hesitate to describe the controversy as one involving air rights to the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.759" offset="1087255">Now, I do not urge that the decision here should turn on whether Penn Central’s laws are characterized as a property right or as a use. As the Solicitor General correctly puts it, it is the substance of the government action that controls rather than the labels that are attached to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.323" offset="1181505">No, Your Honor, the issue raised here is not, as some of the brief seem to suggest, whether the City of New York may validly preclude Penn Central from constructing a building.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.066" offset="1216509">25 years ago in Berman v. Parker, this court, in unanimous opinion proclaimed for all that it is just as appropriate for government action to look to things that beautify and enhance the quality of life as it is to do away with things that are unsanitary.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.046" offset="1276382">But, the issue here simply stated is who is going to bear the loss of the burden that is occasioned by this substantial public benefit?</text>

            <text syncTime="373.627" offset="1574700">Now, I would propose to address the issue that I have stated here first by examining the central premise of the different justifications that have been advanced, first, by the Court of Appeals and second by the city and its friends for imposing the full cost on Penn Central and that premise is that where the government acts in a regulatory capacity rather than through the exercise of eminent domain, there is no need to inquire whether there has been a compensable taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.664" offset="1678876">I shall next show that the decisions of this court interpreting the taking clause, the Fifth Amendment particularly those emphasizing its high content of fairness support the conclusion that the provoked prohibitions imposed here do constitute a taking for which compensation is constitutionally required.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.713" offset="3099102">Now the first point I wanted to make is that, however the government acts, whether by eminent domain or purporting to act by government regulation, there must be an inquiry into whether there is a compensable taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.403" offset="3165871">Now the Court of Appeals brushed that over.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.372" offset="3173707">They simply recited, this is government regulation and therefore, there need be no kind of an inquiry into taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.995" offset="3196173">Those who support the Court’s action take the same view that automatically, once you can say this is regulatory action then there is no reason or there is no occasion to look to see whether there is compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.298" offset="3241417">Now that is the premise that underlies both the Court of Appeals' opinion and also the position submitted by the city here, and I think it is not supported by the Fifth Amendment itself or by the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.901" offset="3287810">The Fifth Amendment does not by its terms apply only to cases of eminent domain, it applies broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.351" offset="3313619">Cases in these courts have held that whatever governmental power is exercised, police power, commerce power, if there is a taking you look to see whether the Fifth Amendment comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.611" offset="3354684">I suppose Berman v. Parker, which I mentioned earlier stands for the proposition that the right of government to bring about change is designed, as they put it, to enhance the quality of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.725" offset="3399092">All comes within the police power, whether it is done under eminent domain or whether it is done through the exercise of regulatory actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.657" offset="3426886">In most of the cases where there is a problem as to a taking, there has not been an exercise of eminent domain, it is government regulation which is operated in a way which may constitute a taking even though the exercise of eminent domain has not been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.640" offset="3482788">It is claimed here that the Goldblatt decision of this Court establishes a different rule, a rule that says, you do not look in the case of regulation to what has been taken, you look rather to what is leftover.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.507" offset="3534302">Now that decision does contain some language with respect to the uses left to the property owner but I do not believe it establishes anything like proposition claimed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.316" offset="3577456">The challenged regulation there prevented the Sand and Gravel company from continuing its operations on property that was originally rural but had become surrounded by the City of Hempstead.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.863" offset="3615699">Now far from saying, as it is urged here, that valid regulatory action cannot resolve in a compensable taking, the court, taking through Mr. Justice Clark acknowledged at the outset the basic principle on which we rest our case saying, “governmental action in the form of regulation can be so owners as to constitute a taking which constitutionally requires compensation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="906.058" offset="3704516">It then found that there had been no diminution in the value of the property involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.727" offset="3723115">Then therefore, there was not any taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.617" offset="3730743">It went on to find, despite the owner’s claim that Sand and Gravel operations were utterly benign and unlike the other things that had been barred by the exercise of the government regulation, the Court overruled them and set on safety grounds, this would be upheld as a valid exercise of the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.392" offset="3797825">But, it did not say that as a substitute for a finding that a taking had not taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.352" offset="3817678">I submit, that that is the initial inquiry, whether a taking has taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.365" offset="3841711">That is the inquiry that the Court of Appeals did not make in which those supporting the city would not make.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.316" offset="3873476">Those words that constitutional guarantee that property shall not be taken without compensation incorporate, an exceedingly complex constitutional concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.692" offset="3926974">Though it has been with us since the beginning of the republic, nothing approaching an all-purpose principle has been articulated from which one can discern the specific application of the concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.675" offset="3966889">This Court has time and again turned down the opportunity to annunciate any such principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.858" offset="3991654">A scholar in the area recently wrote that judicial efforts to chart a usable test for determining when police power measures imposed constitutionally compensable losses have on the whole been notably unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.157" offset="4044839">With some exceptions the decisional law is largely characterized by confusing an incompatible result of an explained and conclusionary terminology, circular reasoning, and empty rhetoric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.258" offset="4093218">Now those were the scholar’s words, not mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.683" offset="4102935">But I hasten to say that I have no all-purpose tests to offer the Court and I acknowledge more than the normal humility with which one must approach such constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.759" offset="4151314">I do put you, however that a review of the taking cases does disclose two guidelines that may usefully be applied here in determining whether the city’s action constitutes a compensable taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.486" offset="4198230">When regulatory action is directed towards the elimination of offensive uses or condition, it has been held in many cases that the resulting loss to the property owner is non-compensable because it is one that he may be properly called upon to bear for the public good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.098" offset="4260610">Such cases began as you all know with the elimination of common nuisances, and then went on to encompass other properties and uses which though not nuisances were offensive to the general tenor of the community such as breweries and billiard halls and liberty stables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.564" offset="4326543">Now the construction of a multi-story office building in Midtown, Manhattan, which Penn Central is prohibited from doing, is not only permitted by the zoning laws but it is actually encouraged as an efficient use of valuable land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.749" offset="4387252">I submit therefore, that the principle justification for tolerating some non-compensable diminution in property value was a result of government regulation lends no support to the city’s action here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.443" offset="5790027">Now I submit that the most frequently applied consideration in determining when government regulation has resulted in a compensable taking has simply stated one of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.810" offset="5839451">As this Court observed in the Forest case, there is a strong element of ethics in the constitutional requirement that private property not be taken without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.293" offset="5873410">Time and again, decisions of this Court have reiterated that the overwriting purpose of the Fifth Amendment guarantee is to assure fairness in the impact of government upon the owners of private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.118" offset="5920744">Back in 1893, Mr. Justice, Breuer speaking for the Court said, “The Fifth Amendment prevents the public from loading upon one individual more than his just share for the burdens of government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.023" offset="5968287">40 years later Mr. Justice Brandie speaking for the Court, “Particular individuals may not be singled out to bear the cost of advancing the public convenience.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.269" offset="6005276">In 1960, the Court said the Fifth Amendment is designed to bar the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which in all fairness and justice should be borne by the public as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.500" offset="6054282">Just a few years ago in a decision by Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think the essence of these declarations was captured and the statement that the Fifth Amendment derives as much content from basic equitable principles of fairness as it does from technical concepts of Property Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.600" offset="6118648">Now these two taking guidelines that I have suggested would appear to be opposite sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.446" offset="6142054">Where you are eliminating the use or condition which is imposing a burden on other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.117" offset="6164728">It is fair to permit the person who is charging that to take some expense, to take some burden in order to eliminate the burden that is on the rest of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.452" offset="6198060">On the other hand, where the government sets out to secure an improvement or a benefit for all society performing what has been called its entrepreneurial or its resource acquisition function, basic considerations of fairness dictate that a disproportionate share of the cost of securing that benefit not be borne or loaded on a single individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.362" offset="6281652">Significantly, neither the Court of Appeals nor the city and its supporting friends have anything to say about this fairness concept which has to be the lifeblood of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.986" offset="6324179">Nothing they could say would alter the fact that full burden of the city’s action in freezing the terminal falls exclusively on Penn Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.013" offset="6360333">It is being called upon to bear a public burden which in all fairness and justice should be borne by the public as a whole in order to obtain the full and unimpeded enjoyment of the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.318" offset="6413518">I turn now to the justification that the Court of Appeals found for allowing the full cost of the terminal preservation to be borne by Penn Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.130" offset="6444760">It made no inquiry into taking and simply looked to see whether Penn Central had established that it would be impossible, and that is the word of the Court, for it to earn a reasonable return on the terminal without utilizing the air rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.976" offset="6496169">It is our contention of course that whatever the remaining value of the terminal, we are entitled to compensation for that part that has been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.053" offset="6528457">But, even if the remaining value of the terminal is to be given the critical significance that has been accorded by the court, that value was erroneously ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.720" offset="6571089">In applying what it acknowledged to be a special rule for landmark statutes, the Court divided the value of property into two separate ingredients that contributed by private efforts and that contributed by the efforts of organized society as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.574" offset="6626573">Then, without attempting to ascertain how much of the terminal’s value had been contributed by private or society efforts, it concluded that Penn Central was not entitled any compensation because it had failed to establish that there was no possibility that it could not earn a reasonable return on the remaining and also un-ascertained privately contributed value of the terminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.014" offset="8120254">It has not been defined, but I take it that if comprehensive means anything, it means something close to the opposite of selective or highly particularized.</text>

            <text syncTime="2027.530" offset="8190367">There are vast pervasive zoning laws in the City of New York and this sits on top of them superimposed, and it permits highly-selective and particularized actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.125" offset="8236760">The designation for example of the Public Library or of the Brooklyn Bridge or of the Statue of Liberty as historic landmarks does not mean anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.101" offset="8272600">The designation of a final home as a historic landmark may simply give the owner the satisfaction of putting a brass plaque on the door to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.146" offset="8304783">The recent designation of the Radio City Music Hall interior as a landmark was followed very quickly by efforts by the State and the city to put up about $2 million to keep the show going for another year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.980" offset="8356192">But it is the unpredictable nature and the highly-selective nature of what not only has been done but indeed what the law contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.911" offset="8395898">That is why the Court of Appeals looked at this as zoning and said, “No, Sir, it cannot be zoning.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.064" offset="13968444">That is correct, but there has not been in this particular case and that the facts and circumstances of this particular case show there has not been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.310" offset="13997492">I will only take one more minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.776" offset="14007314">With respect to the air rights, the testimonial trial showed that the proposed builder UPG, had offered Penn Central $3.8 million a year for the right to develop air rights over the Biltmore Hotel an eligible receiving site under the transfer development rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.882" offset="14095712">Penn Central’s representative testified that $3.8 million was insufficient because it wanted $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.376" offset="14125701">They computed the $5 million as follows: it was guaranteed $3 million if it developed the air rights above the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.732" offset="14155167">In addition, its profit from building Biltmore was $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.932" offset="14171990">So to get the same deal that it would have had with respect to building over Grand Central Terminal, it concluded it had to receive $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.444" offset="14210024">I urge that this is not the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.880" offset="14223712">The issue is not whether or not Penn Central was entitled to the highest and best use, the $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.806" offset="14247431">The issue is whether or not the $3.8 million return by using the Biltmore site, together with their failure to establish that the property, as restricted, cannot earn a reasonable rate of return is so unfair as to really in all effect totally emasculate the land use regulation that is now under attack because in a city like New York it is unusual for all of the landmarks to be clustered in historic districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.553" offset="14366445">For the preservation purpose to be accomplished, it is necessary that the Landmarks Commission be able to act wherever it finds a building of historical and architectural significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.857" offset="14411689">The total plan here is a reasonable one, it is a different type of land use regulation, but all the courts have applied the traditional rules and have properly concluded that this regulation should be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3627.606" offset="14590680">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.280" offset="14601338">The United States has a vital interest in these proceedings today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.018" offset="14616280">Congress and the executive have declared in many statutes that it is a national policy, “the historical and cultural foundations of the nation” should be preserved as a living part of our community life and development in order to give our people a sense of orientation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.825" offset="14687543">Now the Federal Government is deeply involved in historical preservation in many ways and I will allude to them only briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.546" offset="14714396">Number one, it designates and preserves historic landmarks on its own public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.794" offset="14735399">Two, it sometimes utilizes the power of eminent domain to acquire sites of national historic significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.560" offset="14762462">Number three, since 1966 it maintains a national registry of historic buildings which have local, state, city, and national significance and now contains 15,000 such buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.941" offset="14815960">Fourth, it provides financial aid to states and cities so that they can survey their historic preservation problems, formulate plans, and embark on preservation projects to preserve their treasures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.383" offset="14869773">Fifth, all federal agencies pursuant to the 1966 Act and to an executive order, who license projects or spend money on projects in any state must take account of the need to preserve historic sites which are registered or which are eligible for registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.998" offset="14940199">Finally, there are several very specific enactments including the National Environmental Protection Act which requires need for impact statements to assess the impact of historic sites that might be affected by proposed projects.</text>

            <text syncTime="3773.881" offset="15175719">Naturally, the Federal Government has relied primarily upon state and local governments and their Police power and their particular historic preservation laws to bring about the preservation of buildings except where those buildings are on public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.567" offset="15234547">However, we do have several instances not for historic preservation but for other uses which raise a similar question where the Federal Government to its regulatory powers, does in fact impose restrictions upon land use which it does not compensate for by eminent domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="4508.447" offset="18113972">So indeed many of the cases in which the courts have held there is no taking at a reasonable regulatory use, they point out that it leaves the option with the owner as to whether or not he wants to sale or lease it or use it for other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.020" offset="18176352">All of these cases if I may finish in one sentence, all of the land use cases have pointed out that it is almost inevitable starting with Justice Holmes back in the Coal case that when the government pursues a Police power for a legitimate end, it will likely end up with the diminution of value of land and the restriction of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.094" offset="18268617">Unless that becomes so onerous as to move over into a taking and where that line is drawn the courts have over the years said, it is very difficult that it is a reasonable use of the Police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.982" offset="18324205">I think the rule which appellant would suggest that any time there is a loss in value of property due to a reasonably valid regulation use of the Police power that the owner must be compensated is indeed a radical revolutionary rule, which just simply has no foundation in the past cases of the Police power or indeed in the taking cases themselves.</text>
