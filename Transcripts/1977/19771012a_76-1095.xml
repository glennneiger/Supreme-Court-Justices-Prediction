            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="5.971" offset="103810">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.243" offset="116871">This federal income tax case Commissioner v. Kowalski is here on certiorari to the United States, Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.999" offset="155950">It presents a single question with two subparts, whether cash payments to state police troopers of whom Kowalski was one, which are designated as meal allowances are includable in gross income under Section 61 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and are not otherwise excludable from income under a special exclusion provision Section 119, which came into the tax law at the time of the 1954 codification.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.629" offset="306415">In a brief per curiam opinion, the Third Circuit reversed a review decision of the Tax Court with respect to both code sections and held that the meal payments in question here were not gross income, and even if they were, they were excludable under Section 119.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.392" offset="397530">We submit that the Court of Appeals erred as to both points that the cash payments or gross income as that fundamental term in the tax law as defined by Section 61 (a) and that the cash payments here do not qualify for the limited exclusion provided by Section 119 of the Code which briefly provides for an exclusion for meals furnished by an employer to his employee for the convenience of the employer, but only if the meals are furnished on the employer?s business premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.980" offset="543816">So, in this sense the Section 61 (a) aspect of the Court of Appeals? decision is the most troublesome and extraordinary one from our point of view because it holds that a cash payment by an employer to his employee to defray the cost of what is indisputably a personal expense, the cost of eating lunch during the day, does not fit within the statutory phrase 'gross income' from whatever source derived.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.829" offset="659277">I think that I can set forth the facts briefly they are undisputed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="148.788" offset="675055">Mr. Smith, before you do, in your brief on page 6, you say the Tax Court unanimously held that the cash payments did not qualify for the exclusion for gross income under Section 119, is that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="162.356" offset="729390">I think that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.528" offset="738063">There were 5 or 6 dissents on the Section 61 point, but no one dissented on the Section 119 point.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.824" offset="779232">Judge Sterrett wrote a dissenting opinion joined by five judges set forth at pages 32 (a) to 37 (a) of Appendix 8 of the petition which said that -- which concluded that the amounts were not gross income under Section 61.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.852" offset="855300">He did not reach there and I suppose one might say he did not reach the other point although, so -- but there was no expression of disagreement in the Tax Court under Section 119 point.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.713" offset="922801">Mr. Smith while we have you there, you have in mind that when judge -- federal judge is assigned to another circuit or if in his regular duties, a District Judge goes to another station, he sits, he has given, I think its $50 a day allowance if he identifies the expenditure so much for his room, so much for meals and now since the judge presumably eats breakfast, lunch and dinner when he is at home, bear in mind at some points at your convenience would you tell me what do you think of that situation, under this duration or anyone like it, would the judge be required to take treat as income, breakfast, lunch, dinner?</text>

            <text syncTime="265.661" offset="1142543">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the proper tax treatment would seem to me if that situation would be as follows, the judge would -- unless there were complete wash, I am assuming let me back for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.042" offset="1220074">As a theoretical matter, all those payments are part of gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.580" offset="1246301">Moreover, the amounts expended for meals when away from home overnight, under this Court?s Correll decision are a deductible business expense under Section 162 of the Code, so they would --</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="315.552" offset="1342118">Well, but he has employee business expenses, that if an employee is away from home overnight and expends money in aid of his business which is the business of being an employee, those expenses are deductible, so to follow through on your example, the judge would include all of these per diem payments in income and take corresponding deductions, it may well be given the high cost of leaving these days and the particular plight that federal judges find themselves and that there will be a net deficit in which case that, there will be a net deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.908" offset="1511601">It is possible if the judge is frugal that there may be net amount of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.878" offset="1535424">Now, the Internal Revenue Service by regulation takes the position that if an employee must make an accounting to his employer and there is a complete wash you do not have to report the actual items on the return, but you must append the statement to your return saying that you have had per diem payments, you had business expenses and that they net out against each other, so this enables the Internal Revenue Service to be alluded to the fact that there are these items on the return and if they want to audit --</text>

            <text syncTime="552.245" offset="2288900">This meal allowance is described on a New Jersey police recruitment brochure as in item to be received and in addition to salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.203" offset="2324740">It is clearly an important aspect of the troopers compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.387" offset="2345534">The amount of the meal allowance is a subject of negotiations between the Police Troopers Union and the state and in fact has gone up over the years that used to be $70 a month and now, it ranges from $1,740 for troopers like respondent Kowalski $1,776, for lieutenants and captains, and $2,136 for the commander of the New Jersey State Police, the Superintendent colonel.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.925" offset="2471653">So there is a variation in amount depending upon your rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.570" offset="2494223">The meal allowances are also significantly included in the compensation base on which the troopers pension benefits are computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.819" offset="2535183">Now, under the cash meal allowance system, the troopers are expected to eat within their assigned patrol area, and so what they have to do as and when they are going to go to lunch, when I used to lunch, I am really talking about a mid-shift meal.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.444" offset="2597668">I am just using lunch as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.322" offset="2609266">They have to check in with the officer in-charge and tell him they will be at such and such a restaurant and they will be there for the lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.704" offset="2638732">Now, there is no restrictions on the cash payments because the troopers can eat at home if they wish, if they leave within their assigned duty area, they can eat in a public restaurant as I suggested, or they can even take their lunch or take a sandwich from home and eat in their patrol car, if they so desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.746" offset="2714905">The amount of the meal allowance is not calculated at all to provide any kind of reimbursement for any specific amount of meals, it is simply a flat amount per year, in this case $1,740.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.911" offset="2771539">On his 1970 return, respondent Kowalski reported his $9,000 in wages, which included a base salary of $8,739 and cash meal allowances of $326.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.801" offset="2847189">Now, the reason he reported part of this cash meal allowance on his 1970 return is, I think significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.982" offset="2879895">He reported it because the state of New Jersey in October 1970, that is for the final quarter of this taxable year, changed its policy and began to include the cash meal allowances on the Form W-2 of their troopers, so the Internal Revenue Service began to be advised formally of the fact that these troopers were receiving these additional amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.119" offset="2992430">But respondent Kowalski did not report the remaining $1,371 portion to the first nine months of 1970 because that was not included on his Form W-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.411" offset="3045615">The only reason this sort of came to the Internal Revenue Services attention and in one respect this aspect of the case is really significant for purposes of the second case because it shows the importance of the need for the Internal Revenue Service to withhold on cash payments from an employer to employee at the source, but the reason, the Internal Revenue Service found out about it, is because that they disallowed respondent Kowalskis travel expenses, and after respondent Kowalski filed his petition of the Tax Court in his service, filed its answer and began to engage in a work -- in a deeper kind of discovery, they discovered the fact that he had this additional $1,371 by happenstance of this litigation and then filed an amended answer which raised the issue which is before the Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.520" offset="5822014">Now, during this last 50 years, the Code has -- the tax law has been codified twice, in 1939 and in 1954 and Congress was aware that Treasury Regulations providing for the special treatment to, were turned out to be not just the military, but the uniform services which includes the coastal and geodetic survey, public health service as well and Congress never expressed any opinion that this was not be the governing rule and in fact, in 37 U.S.C. 101, which we quote at Page 19 of our brief, Congress explicitly confirmed the understanding that regular military compensation includes ?federal tax advantages accruing to aforementioned? is in subsistence allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.646" offset="6022530">Now, the respondents in this case have tried to make much of the fact that the there are analogies between the state police and military, but quite frankly, we think that Congress and the courts and the treasury have for the last half century treated them as a very special case, and in fact, the legislative evidence is all to the contrary because the Congress in 1954 enacted Section 120 of the Code, which we referred to briefly in our brief which basically provided a $5 a day exclusion for state police troopers which is subsistence allowance, and then in 1958, Congress repealed that for very much the same reason that sort of underlays our position in this case, is that after they enacted the provision, many states simply said allocated part of the compensation of state police troopers, the subsistence allowance as even though that was not the intent of what Congress was trying to do and they say basically worked in an equity that they gave state police troopers something that other people did not have, so it repeal 19-120 and 1958 now, if somehow there is an exclusion from gross income, its respondents? contend to these cash payments, then the whole congressional exercise between 1954 and 1958, it is really a nullity and we submit that congress knew what it was doing, the military were special and to the extent it addressed the problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.165" offset="6372570">It focused on the fact that and ultimately concluded that these cash payments to state police troopers were not to be excluded from gross income, but would to be includable in that sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.463" offset="7369821">The State of New Jersey started withholding on the troopers meal allowances in response to pressure from the Internal Revenue Service which have been going on by a correspondence over a period of several years?</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.865" offset="7431366">The petitioner?s argument basically comes down to the point that the meal allowance is income because there is no statutory exclusion and in order to understand how this case fits within the long history of exceptions from gross income, several crucial facts must be emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.417" offset="7509628">New Jersey State Police has organized long military lines and it has unlimited statewide jurisdiction for all police functions, it is not merely a highway patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.147" offset="7556544">For more than 25 years, prior to July 01, 1949, the State of New Jersey fed its troopers at meal stations located throughout the state at the expense of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.325" offset="7609207">By 1949 the state had found that the meal station system was no longer acceptable because it took the troopers away from their police duties for too much time, therefore in 1949, the state abandoned the meal station system and instituted the meal allowance system in issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.587" offset="7682246">The meal allowance system was instituted by the state for the benefit of the state and meal allowance system has worked well for the state, not only has it provided the state and the public with better police protection, but it also has been proven less expensive than the meal station system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3004.133" offset="12096417">I just have a couple of points Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.002" offset="12111986">The respondent has suggested that there is this non-statutory convenience of the employer test, which somehow suffuses Section 61 of the Code and enables him to exclude these cash payments from gross income, but even assuming as we point out in our brief that there is such a test and we do not think that there -- we think that that test has now been channeled exclusively under Section 119, but even assuming that he is right that there is such a test, under that test he has to meet two qualifications by his own analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.290" offset="12265064">He has to demonstrate that these amounts were non-compensatory and he has to demonstrate that the cash payments were for the convenience of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.169" offset="12300590">We submit that he would meet none of those tests with respect to Section -- with respect to his own analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.743" offset="12330892">First of all, with respect to whether the amounts were compensatory, he relies on a finding of the Tax Court that the meal allowance was not intended to represent an additional compensation, but as I pointed out in my opening argument that is a slander read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.413" offset="12405602">That finding of the tax, does not say that there would not compensation, it simply said what the state hoped that they would be and this Court has said in Commissioner v. Duberstein that what the parties hope, labels put on things, but they hope the tax effect will be is irrelevant for purposes of what the objective circumstances are and in fact later on in the Tax Court?s opinion on page 13 (a) they say, even though we have found that the meal allowance was not intended as additional compensation, it was obviously compensatory to a trooper to the extent that it paid for food which he otherwise would have had to pay for some other source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.283" offset="12557113">We conclude under Section 61 that except as otherwise provided in the income tax law, the meal allowance received by petitioner is includable in his gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.866" offset="12591385">Now, with respect to the convenience of the employer, we submit that cash payments do not serve the convenience of the employer because what the respondent has done is to confuse the issue by attempting to talk about all these meal restrictions that is you have to eat within the patrol area, you have to eat within a certain area, but the point is he has not explained why those restrictions have anything to do with the convenience of the employer, all they have done, in other words if as Mr. Justice Stevens has suggested they simply paid cash as they did and did not call it a meal allowance.</text>
