            <text syncTime="6.805" offset="107148">The respondents in this case are public school students who were suspended without a hearing. They sued petitioners, the school officials seeking damages under Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.613" offset="178410">They contend that the denial of a hearing deprived them of that Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.923" offset="211638">The District Court agreed that there was a denial of procedural due process, but refused to award damages because respondents had proved no resulting injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.102" offset="260330">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.431" offset="273705">It held that respondents are entitled to recover substantial damages even if the suspensions were justified and even if respondents do not prove any injury other than the denial of a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.201" offset="332742">Petitioners do not contest the holding of a constitutional right not to be suspended without notice of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.174" offset="364611">They insist, however, that the Court of Appeals erred in it's holding of entitlement to substantial damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.682" offset="394704">We agree with petitioners that the mere denial of notice and hearing without more cannot be the basis for the award of substantial damages in absence of any proof of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.088" offset="448308">We make clear in our opinion filed today that compensable injury may include mental and emotional distress provided a claim therefore is supported by competent evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.442" offset="505672">As there was no such evidence in this case, we hold that respondents are not entitled to recover substantial damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.410" offset="541617">We also hold, however, that even where denial of procedural due process is not shown to have caused actual injury, the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages not to exceed $1.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.120" offset="604415">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.497" offset="617894">Mr. Justice Marshall concurs in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.648" offset="630538">Mr. Justice Blackmun took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
