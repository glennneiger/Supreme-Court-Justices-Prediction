            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="20.210" offset="160774">These consolidated cases involve the licensing of nuclear power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.596" offset="186374">In 76-419, the Vermont Yankee case, after a hearing before the licensing board of what is now called the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, petitioner Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation was awarded a license to operate a nuclear a power plant in Vernon, Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.454" offset="273727">Shortly therefore the commission promulgated a rule to the effect that it was necessary in licensing proceedings to consider the environmental effects of operations to reprocess nuclear fuel or dispose of waste resulting from the reprocessing operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.726" offset="346870">The commission then reexamined Vermont Yankee's operating license in light of this new rule and determined that Vermont Yankee should still retain its license.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.519" offset="386054">Upon a challenge initiated by the respondent National Resources Defense Council in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbian Circuit, the rule was invalidated because the procedures employed by the agency in promulgating a rule were in the opinion of that court inadequate despite the fact of the agency employed all the procedures expressly required by the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.039" offset="500156">The court further ruled that the Commission must reconsider under a validly promulgated rule, it's decision with respect of Vermont Yankee's operating license.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.870" offset="539445">In 76-528 the Consumer's power case, again after the required administrative hearing, the licensing board awarded a permit to petitioner consumer's power company to construct two nuclear reactors in Midland, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.940" offset="611752">The Court of Appeals again ordered the Commission to reconsider its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.371" offset="629410">This time the court ruled that the environmental impact statement for construction of the reactors was fatally defective, and because it failed to examine energy conservation measures as an alternative to plants of the size presently contemplated by consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.160" offset="712584">The court also held that the report given to the commission by the advisory committee on reactor safeguards was insufficient, and the Commission should have on its motion, so to speak, sent the report back to the committee for further elucidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.625" offset="786459">We granted certiorari to consider important questions of administrative law raised by these rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.938" offset="815716">In an opinion filed with a clerk today, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.665" offset="838599">We hold that the Court of Appeals has misapplied the statutory and decisional law which caution reviewing courts against improperly intruding into an agency's decision making process and against engrafting their own notions of proper procedures upon agencies entrusted with substantive functions by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.612" offset="926370">Indeed administrative decision should be set aside only for substantial procedural or substantive reasons as mandated by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.633" offset="962524">Yet some of the court's reasons in this case for ordering a remand in this case are at best insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.521" offset="990005">We are left with a distinct impression that the review in this case can fairly be described as judicial intervention run riot.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.540" offset="1034099">Congress has made fundamental policy choices regarding the development and use of nuclear energy and those choices are not subject to reexamination in the federal courts under the guise of judicial review of agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.571" offset="1098256">Time may prove wrong the decision to develop nuclear energy as it may prove wrong countless other legislative decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.569" offset="1138276">But it is Congress and the appropriate agencies which must eventually make any such judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.253" offset="1160950">It is not one entrusted to the courts, upon remand the Court is of course free to examine the rule under the standard of review enunciated in the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.726" offset="1206821">Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
