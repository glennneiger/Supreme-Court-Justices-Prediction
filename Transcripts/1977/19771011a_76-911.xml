            <text syncTime="65.733" offset="342888">This is a criminal case arising under the Clean Air Act as it stood prior to the amendment of this past summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.173" offset="372668">Section 112 (b) of the as it then stood, instructed the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate an emission standard to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants, one of which is asbestos.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.279" offset="433063">The administrator issued a work practice regulation for demolition operations and gave it the title Emission Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.134" offset="464514">Section 112 (c) of the Act prohibits a violation of an emission standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.877" offset="487398">My client is accused by an indictment of violating Section 112 (c) of the Act for an alleged failure to follow the Environmental Protection Agency's work practice rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.199" offset="536717">In the trial court, we challenged the indictment on the ground that a violation of an emission standard is an essential element of the crime and that the work practice rule is not the same thing as an emission standard, notwithstanding its title.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.954" offset="591783">The trail court agreed and dismissed the first count of a two count indictment which is the only count now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.688" offset="626683">The Government appealed and Sixth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.822" offset="639221">The Sixth Circuit held that our position amounted to a challenge to the validity of the regulation itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.615" offset="754369">The issue -- the first issue as I understand it sir, is the meaning of Section 307 (b) (2) of the Act which by its language says their shall be no judicial review in a civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement of action which could have been reviewed under the statutory review procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.144" offset="860531">I think one issue which is still open for decision by this Court is whether that statute, that preclusion provision is in fact an absolute preclusion of all judicial consideration of the propriety of actions by the administrator, even actions which on their face are alleged to be in violation of his duties under the Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="247.348" offset="1069301">And you have not pressed any any constitutional issue here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Lipnick</label>
            <text syncTime="251.265" offset="1084975">No sir, except for the fact that I do believe that there is a question of adequacy and effectiveness of the statutory remedy which could invoke the constitutional question and which would require development of a litigation of an issue of fact in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.253" offset="1156968">The preclusion Section as I indicated says there is to be no judicial review in enforcement proceedings of regulations which could be reviewed under the statutory review procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.017" offset="1224051">The review procedure is not now available to my client and could have been initiated only by filing a petition for review within 30 days of the date on which the regulation was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.845" offset="1287372">The Court of Appeals in our view ignored the language of Section 112 (c) itself which prohibits violation of an emission standard and which does not prohibit a violation of any regulation which the administrator might issue, concerning asbestos.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.551" offset="1358111">From that perspective we are not prepared to concede that the trial court was even reviewing the regulation within the meaning of the preclusive provision, as opposed to simply looking at the face of the regulation to ask itself whether it was in fact the type of regulation specified in the criminal prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.019" offset="1444002">However, if that should be considered judicial review, we believe that it is review which is within the sphere of this Court's decisions, which permit a limited type of review even in circumstances when review of agency action is ordinarily unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.365" offset="1517354">We trace that starting with this Court's decision in Leedom v. Kyne in which this Court indicated that statutory review provisions normally contemplate review of agency action which is at least on its face within the scope of agency authority, and therefore, permitted an inquiry into the question of whether the agency in that case had complied with specific statutory instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.220" offset="1628844">Subsequently, in a case cited by the Government in the its brief Brotherhood of Railway Clerks v. Non-Contract Employees this Court again said that non statutory review is available to assure that agency action does not exceed the statutory authority and that action which is ordinarily not reviewable, is in fact reviewable to the extent of ascertaining that the agency performed its statutory duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.301" offset="1741171">And in the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks case this Court as I read the decision entered holdings on the merits on those limited issues of whether the agency action is within the scope of its authority and whether it at least on its face purported to comply with the agency statutory duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.030" offset="1812015">Those holdings were not jurisdictional as I read them, they were holdings on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.120" offset="1832390">Last year in the Thermotron Products case concerning the removal procedure from federal to state, from state to Federal Courts rather and remand procedures back, this Court held that the statutory preclusion of review of a remand order which on its face purported to be absolute still permitted judicial review in the limited sense of ascertaining whether a trial court order of remand was at least based upon one of the grounds for remand specified in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.250" offset="1984945">This past June, the two Voting Act cases which are cited in the Government's brief, I believe continue to recognize this principle of the availability of limited review.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.100" offset="2032384">In Briscoe v. Bell the Court avoided holding that coverage determinations by the Attorney General and by the Director of Census were not open to judicial inquiry, at least to ascertain whether there was reliance by those officials upon the criteria specified in the statute for making those determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.924" offset="2139590">And on the same day in Morris versus Gressette the majority opinion of this Court noted that Congress like the Courts operates on the assumption that public officials will perform there duty and indicates that line of inquiry, harkens back to Leedom v. Kyne and to Railway Clerks which indicates to me a line of authority of this Court which is very sound in my view and very persuasive that legislation governing the scope of review of agency action simply does not contemplate agency action which is lawless.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.923" offset="2303639">That even where the review provisions say review is unavailable, there can be at least an inquiry to ascertain whether an agency took action, which on its face complied with what a statute told the agency to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.168" offset="2536652">I think the question still is, if Congress passes a law which says you must seek review within 30 days or not at all, do they contemplate by the term review or by that provision, do they contemplate foreclosing the Federal Judiciary from any jurisdiction to inquire into the question of whether an administrative agency has committed an act which on its face is unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.023" offset="2736018">Congress said you cannot violate an emission standard and if we cannot raise the question of whether or not this regulation is an emission standard, I think we are in the position of having the Sixth Circuit decision stand, which holds that we can be brought to trial and convicted for conduct which Congress did not make a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.822" offset="2815221">I think we are in the position, if the Sixth Circuit decision stands, I think we are in a position of having a rule which says that even though this agency was at the time in violation of its own continuing mandatory duty to promulgate the kind of regulation Congress told them to promulgate, an emission standard, nonetheless the Federal Courts are going to enforce the violation of law by the agency and they are going to do it by convicting my client of conduct which was not made a crime by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="898.709" offset="3674754">Before the luncheon break, I recall I was asked whether the agency had ever itself considered the question of whether the work practice rule is an emission standard and I think I would like to expand upon my answer just briefly if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.787" offset="3747061">I think the agency has always known work practice rule is not an emission standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.516" offset="3774020">On December 7, 1971, when it first published its proposed regulations in the Federal register, the following statement appears in the preamble to the proposed regulations at volume 36, page 23239 of the Federal register “because there is no suitable technique for sampling and analyzing asbestos in the ambient air or in emission gases, the standards are expressed as requirements for operation of specific control equipment or other equipment of comparable effectiveness or in situations where no control system is available as prohibitions on the use of asbestos.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.496" offset="3957922">When acceptable source of sampling and analytical methods are available and it is possible to delineate hazardous levels, these standards may be revised to require compliance with a measured allowable emission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="985.648" offset="4022496">On April 6, 1973, when the work practice regulation was first promulgated in final form, in the preamble to that publication at volume 38, page 8820 of the Federal register, the agency stated “it is not practicable at this time to establish allowable numerical concentrations for mass emission limits for asbestos.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.281" offset="4145063">And then in the third column of the same page “the means of control used are limitations on visible emissions with an option in some cases to use designated control equipment, requirements that certain procedures be followed and prohibitions on the use of certain materials or certain operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.109" offset="4220400">These means of control are required because of the impossibility at this time of prescribing and enforcing allowable numerical concentrations or mass emission limitations known to provide an ample margin of safety.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.108" offset="6396400">Let me suggest the two kinds of inquiries that I think the District Court should ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.058" offset="6416149">The first kind of inquiry is whether the administrator's regulation purports to rely on Section 112, that is whether he says that this is an emission standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.642" offset="6462542">Second kind of question the District Court might ask and properly so, is whether the administrator's regulation purports to control the emission of the hazardous substance, since Section 112 is a Section dealing with release of hazardous substances into the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.769" offset="6530983">The District Court if it answers those questions affirmatively, that is if it says the administrator says he is relied Section 112 and this regulation in fact controls the emission of hazardous substances into the air should conclude its inquiry at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.948" offset="6591692">There are of course, a myriad of ways in which the administrator might go about controlling those kinds of emissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.006" offset="6620008">The question whether he has controlled emissions in the very way that the statute contemplated is we think exactly the kind of question Congress had in mind when it required review of that thing to come into the District of Columbia circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1726.786" offset="6987081">The District of Columbia Circuit's answer I think would be that this could something for an original action in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.671" offset="7010591">In similar problems before this Court last year in the Depart three Depart cases (Ph) involving the question whether the Court of Appeals or the District Court would have review of certain regulations promulgated by the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.589" offset="7062314">Before you could decide that question you had to decide what kind of regulations they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.524" offset="7082062">I think the District of Columbia Circuit must ask the same kind of question when someone files a petition for review with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.278" offset="7109021">It says this is a regulation promulgated by the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.284" offset="7125112">Is it the kind of thing described in Section 307 (b) (1)?</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.022" offset="7144025">If so it would review it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.792" offset="7151130">If not it must dismiss the petition for review and the two criteria that I gave in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist are I believe the criteria that that Court should ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.736" offset="7190836">I think if you ask those questions here, the regulation satisfies those criteria, and therefore, it was one that could have been reviewed in the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.945" offset="7231692">Let me go back if I can, briefly to discuss the legislative history of Section 307 (b) because I believe that sheds considerable light on the kinds of things that must be reviewed in the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.799" offset="7283101">Section 307 (b) originated in the Senate which adopted the limitation on judicial review as an alternative according to the Senate Report at page 41 to an absolute preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.748" offset="7334928">The reason why it was considering something as extreme as absolute preclusion of judicial review was that it wanted “to maintain the integrity of the time sequences provided throughout the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.900" offset="7387590">Each of the steps in promulgation of regulations and review of regulations is a precondition to something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.436" offset="7413713">In this case a precondition to compliance, but one of the necessities of compliance is to have a valid regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.182" offset="7440671">And so Congress centralized review in a single forum, the District of Columbia Circuit, with a very short time limitation for review in order to achieve two important objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.292" offset="7485079">The first of those objectives was to make sure that any review would produce uniform results across the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.884" offset="7515486">All competitors in the industry would be subjected to the same standards rather than different standards that might be imposed by different judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.942" offset="7547669">And second it wanted to be sure that if in fact the regulation was invalid, the invalidity would be detected quickly, so that the administrator could then promulgate a new ands valid regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.928" offset="7595630">That required a time limitation on judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.688" offset="7610676">Congress set out to give the regulations after the period for review had expired the same unquestioned authority as the Statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.344" offset="7645367">Section 307 accomplish that end, and the position of petitioner which amounts to saying that the regulations are always open to challenge would frustrate that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.076" offset="7692283">We understand petitioner to make three kinds of arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.244" offset="7712867">First petitioner argues that any regulation maybe attacked on its face at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.484" offset="7737840">Second, and this a variation of the first argument that I have already discussed in part, petitioner contents that Section 307 (b) applies only to regulations that are in fact end in law, emission standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.862" offset="7795414">The third contention which petitioner makes only implicitly, but which the District Court made more clearly is that Section 307 applies only to attacks on the procedure by which the regulations promulgated and not the contentions that the substance of the regulation is unauthorized by Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.022" offset="7868034">None of these arguments are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.044" offset="7876080">I will take them up in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.495" offset="7889873">The first argument that regulations maybe attacked on their face at anytime is inconsistent with the progeny of the Yakus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.259" offset="7924981">In the wake of Yakus which upheld against Constitutional attack, a statute very similar to Section 307 (b), this Court applied that rule of preclusion in a number of cases attacking regulations as inconsistent on their face with the Statute authorizing the promulgation of price regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.813" offset="8007215">These cases are collected at page 24 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.905" offset="8023515">If there are any reason to distinguish between a tax on the face of the regulation and the tax on the regulations applied and Section 307 makes no such distinction, it will be more appropriate to bar facial attacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.323" offset="8081194">After all facial defects are known the instant a regulation is promulgated, whereas attacks on the regulation as applied in particular cases may not come to rise until later, and therefore, it maybe difficult to protest within 30 days, things that are unknown at the promulgation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.785" offset="8155068">Petitioner contents, however, that Leedom against Kyne supports the position that a person always may challenge a regulation as facially inconsistent with the authorizing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.993" offset="8203865">But this Court has pointed out in later cases, most recently last June in Briscoe against Bell, footnote 13, that Leedom did not establish that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.220" offset="8248795">Leedom was a case in which judicial review was conditioned on a final order by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.371" offset="8281396">It was necessary to construe that ambiguous term in order to determine when review was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.295" offset="8309086">If in Leedom that term had not been construed to make review available, it might never have been available, but those problems do not arise here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.760" offset="8822967">One is to form a trade association which the National Association of Demolition Contractors is, which acts effectively as the agent of all of of the small demolition contractors for reading the Federal register and advising them of their interests and in some cases including a subsequent challenge to the regulation at issue here, the National Association of Demolition Contractors has filed a petition for judicial review acting to protect the interests of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.805" offset="8939159">That kind of collective action is always available to small contractors, but the second answer is that, I think that it is appropriate for Congress to require small contractors to read the Federal register.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.044" offset="9148139">Second argument which we have discussed briefly already is that Section 307 applies only to emission standards, and therefore, you have to decide first whether something is in emission standard in order to know whether review is precluded in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.397" offset="9213550">I think the answer to that as I said to you earlier Mr. Justice Stevens is that that makes jurisdiction turn on the merits and it makes it turn on the merits in a way that would make Section 307 (b) completely ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.659" offset="9282617">One of the things that can be done to challenge regulations of this sort is to contend that they are not only not emission standards, but they are not emission standards because they are arbitrary capricious and abusive discretion of the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.895" offset="9343535">It is clear that Congress did not authorize the administrator of the EPA to be arbitrary or to be capricious or to abuse his discretion or to do something that on its face is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.163" offset="9388570">All of those things are the reasons why the administrator has acted unlawfully, and therefore, has not promulgated the kind of emission standard that the Statute contemplated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.676" offset="12106663">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.294" offset="12117112">I have only a few brief observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.122" offset="12140413">First the National Association of Demolishing Contractors which suddenly seems to have backed in as a party to this case was in fact first organized within a very few months previous to the promulgation of the work practice regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.795" offset="12215123">It is true that the National Association of Demolishing Contractors now undertakes certain legal activities which might be described as done jointly for its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.742" offset="12274892">It is also true that, that legal work was undertaken in response to the very problem, which underlies this very case which is that small businessmen do not read ten and twenty thousand pages of fine print of the federal register every year and they particularly do not do it in 30 days and I am not aware of any Act of Congress which says that they have to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.130" offset="12384501">I think a reference was made to the notice -- provision of the -- to the notice proceeding of the administrator from the standpoint of publishing a proposed regulation for comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.811" offset="12447195">I am not sure that my client Adamo Wrecking Company knew about the proposed regulation, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.890" offset="12483453">I am not sure that any wrecking company knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.890" offset="12499545">I am sure that anybody picking it up to read it, would find on the very first page, 23239 of volume 36 of the federal register “the sources covered in the asbestos standard are mining, milling, spraying and manufacturing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.767" offset="12590973">I think it does --</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.561" offset="12594212">Can I ask you in the criminal enforcement proceeding, is there some -- what is the state of knowledge by the defendant supposed to be for liability?</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.176" offset="12664639">As a matter of law sir, I believe under the Boyce Motor Lines case, we have to be shown to have knowledge of the facts which would constitute of violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.770" offset="12711032">I take that to mean we have to know that the material that we are dealing with is in fact friable asbestos as defined in the regulation and that we must also know that whatever it is, we are proved to have done would in fact cause an emission of that material.</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.736" offset="12846869">I think the word is just knowingly and I think that is the meaning of that term as well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.056" offset="12864214">I think that it is obvious on the face of the statute that Congress did not tell the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, just go out and do whatever you think is best to control emissions of asbestos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.892" offset="12915519">Congress for whatever reason, and as 1977 amendments teaches, Congress changed its mind and was persuaded that it should have done something differently in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.271" offset="12957001">Congress originally told the administrator to go out and promulgate emission standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.047" offset="12976123">I think even before the 1977 amendments, there is no way that this Act can be read as a whole and particularly the references in other Sections of the Act to emission standards, there is just no way that one can conclude that it is reasonable to think that an emission standard is now or ever could have been the same thing as a work practice rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.980" offset="13143829">I think -- well the closest case I would have would be Thermotron from last year in which if I recall correctly the statute said, decision remanding to a State Court was absolutely unreviewable and this Court said that it was at least reviewable to ascertain that the trial judge had remanded on a ground specified as a basis for remand in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.344" offset="13269321">I think if we can have that much inquiry here, we can look to see whether this regulation is in fact an emission standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.212" offset="13300772">That is what we are charged with violating, an emission standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.598" offset="13314356">There is no Section of this Act which says or at least we are not -- there is a Section of this Act, 113 if I recall correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.986" offset="13355839">which says that it is a crime to knowingly violate any regulation issued as part of a state implementation plan, under Section 110.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.047" offset="13388126">It is a crime to violate any regulation issued under Section 110 as a part of the State implementation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.009" offset="13416025">The Section we are charged with violating does not say it is a crime to violate any regulation administrator might issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.043" offset="13444132">It only says it is a crime to violate an emission standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.128" offset="13456462">And if we can have the same scope of review as was accorded in the Herman Stortford (ph) case last year, I think that is enough to allow us to show that this regulation is not an emission standard, if indeed we are asking for review of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.324" offset="13529187">In our view we still think that there is a substantial question whether we are asking for a ruling by the Trial Court on whether this indictment alleges an essential element of the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.656" offset="13562519">Mr. Lipnick, if we should be persuaded that the jurisdictional issue depends on whether or not it is an emission standard, and you have to decide the merits to decide whether 307 (b) (2) applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.849" offset="13607345">In your view, should this Court decide that question or should we send it back to the Court of Appeals because the Court of Appeals did not decide that question as I remember?</text>

            <text syncTime="3388.798" offset="13635140">In our view, I think the record is perfectly adequate to enable this Court to decide it, particularly with the 1977 amendments which I think make abundantly clear that a work practice rule just as not the same thing as an emission standard and with the government just today said that in the government's view, the 1977 amendments do not change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.492" offset="13729912">I think that even without those facts, I think it is so clear, I think it is so clear on the face of the statute that this Court can decide the question in the interest of judicial economy, but with the addition to 1977 amendments and with the Government's position that 1977 amendments do not change anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.329" offset="13805249">I think that if this Court should conclude that there is jurisdiction, I do not see how there is any room for doubt as to the result and I think that if I recall correctly, in the Perkins case which is cited in the Government's brief, this Court indicated that where the record was adequate to unable this Court to decide a question which had not been decided by the Court of Appeals that it would do so in the interest of judicial economy and I would suggest that it would be appropriate in this case.</text>
