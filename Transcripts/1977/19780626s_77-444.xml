            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.962" offset="123891">This case is here from the New York state Court Of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.363" offset="149491">The Grand Central Terminal in New York city back in 1967 was designated a land mark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission which administers New York city's Landmark Preservation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.237" offset="220962">Although, the appellant the Penn Central Transportation company which owns the terminal opposed the landmark designation before the Landmark's Preservation Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.346" offset="277491">It did not seek judicial review of the designation decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.211" offset="300897">However, in 1968, Penn Central entered in to an agreement with a British Firm to construct a multi-storey office building above the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.231" offset="348962">It was to be a 55 storey office building and Penn Central was to receive a $1 Million annually as rental, during construction, and at least $3 million annually as rental, thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.154" offset="416672">Because of the terminal's landmark designation however, the structure could not be built without the permission of the Landmarks Preservation Commission because that's what the Landmarks Preservation Law provides and Penn Central applied for that permission and the commission denied permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.293" offset="509250">Again Penn Central didn't seek judicial review as a denial but brought this suit in the New York Courts claiming at the Landmarks Preservation law has taken it's property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.748" offset="587094">The New York Court of Appeals rejected that claim and we affirm the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.421" offset="621785">Again the only issue before us is whether the state court was correct in holding at the restrictions imposed by the landmark's law to not effect the taking of Penn Central's property for public use within the meaning of the Fifth amendment which of course is made applicable to the States, to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.300" offset="705272">In agreeing with the view, that the restrictions do not affect the taking, we rely on decision cited in the opinion that hold that when state tribunals reasonably conclude as did the New York Court of Appeals here that the common good will be promoted by prohibiting particular contemplated uses of land, land use regulations that destroy or adversely affect real property and thus may nevertheless be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.556" offset="826272">Now Penn Central's position stated boldly appears to be that the only means of ensuring that selected owners are not singled out to endure financial hardship for no reason, is to hold then any restriction imposed on individual landmarks pursuant to the New York scheme is a taking without more requiring the payment of just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.380" offset="925537">We find no merit in that argument but we see no basis for disagreement with the New York court that the restrictions imposed are substantially related to the promotion of the general welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.438" offset="977782">We therefore as I said affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.475" offset="990007">Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissents and joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
