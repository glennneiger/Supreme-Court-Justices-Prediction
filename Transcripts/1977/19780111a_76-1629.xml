            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Urbanczyk</label>
            <text syncTime="26.751" offset="186984">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.606" offset="198373">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.773" offset="219062">The issue presented is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment was federal prosecution of an Indian defendant under the Major Crimes Act because of his prior conviction in Tribal Court of lesser included offenses arising out of the same conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.683" offset="278621">United States submits that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar such a federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.131" offset="300459">Facts of the case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.486" offset="309864">An incident involving a young Indian woman occurred on Navajo Indian Reservation on October 16, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.782" offset="339016">Respondent was immediately taken into custody by an Indian policeman and two days later he pleaded guilty in Indian Tribal Court to two minor offenses proscribed by the Navajo Tribal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.672" offset="386664">The Navajo Tribal Court sentenced respondent to 60 days in jail or to pay a fine of $150.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.234" offset="424907">Thereafter a Federal Grand jury returned an indictment which alleged or which charged that during the event of October 16, 1974 respondent had in fact assaulted the young Indian woman with an intent to rape her.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.735" offset="490840">Now that indictment was dismissed on grounds that are not relevant here and a subsequent indictment was entered for carnal knowledge of female Indian under the age of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.212" offset="544757">Now that indictment was dismissed by the District Court on the ground “that the defendant had already once been placed in jeopardy for the same offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="124.657" offset="578611">That is that the federal offense of carnal knowledge was dismissed because of respondent’s prosecution and conviction in the Tribal Court of the minor offenses under Tribal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.503" offset="629916">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.862" offset="639424">The principal component of its decision and the principal issue before the Court today is that the dual sovereignty principle which has applied in the federal or state context to allow prosecutions by each governmental authority for the same offense does not apply in a Tribal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.390" offset="709537">I should point out that there are two other components of the court’s reasoning that was essential to decision in that case: One was that the Navajo offense of contributing to delinquency of a minor was a lesser included offense of the federal offense of carnal knowledge; and the second is that the Double Jeopardy Clause inevitably bars the same sovereign from prosecuting a person for a greater offense after a previous conviction for a lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.581" offset="826252">We have not challenged the first of those components; we have not raised any question as to the relationship of the specific tribal crime and a federal crime that is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.152" offset="872541">We have, however, as an alternative submission, suggested that there should be an exception in this case in the circumstances of this case to the general rule that would bar the subsequent prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.052" offset="916113">But the main submission of the Government today and the issue that I would like to discuss primarily in my argument is that the Double Jeopardy Clause is wholly inapplicable in the federal tribal context as it is wholly inapplicable in the federal state context.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.917" offset="979643">Court of Appeals rested its contrary holding on the preposition that tribes did not have the sovereign status of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.562" offset="1022170">The Court recognized that although Indian tribes, who were separate people that had powers of internal self government, that the tribes were not states because the Federal Government has plenary control over the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.328" offset="1073266">These same kinds of themes appear in respondent’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.474" offset="1089880">Our disagreement with the Court of Appeals analysis does not with the premises but with the conclusion that it reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.901" offset="1115584">We agree that tribes do not have the sovereign status of state precisely because the Federal Government has plenary control over the tribes, whereas the Federal Government’s control over states although supreme within certain defined limits is not plenary.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.496" offset="1185906">But we submit that -- but we disagree with the respondent’s and the Court of Appeals’ conclusion from that, that it follows that Tribal Courts are merely arms of the federal sovereign and therefore that the dual sovereignty principle cannot apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.873" offset="1243375">That conclusion rest on a gross over simplification of the status of tribes in this country and also on an unjustifiably narrow reading of the dual sovereignty principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.389" offset="1293530">To state it generally at the outset, it is our position that the Court can imply the dual sovereignty principle in this context, without embracing a concept of tribal sovereignty that gives the tribes and measure of independence against the Federal Government or that elevates tribes to the status of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.998" offset="1367927">Tribes are not independent from the Federal Government, and there is only two sovereigns in this country, in this true sense of that term, that is the United States and the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.847" offset="1411290">As I will explain, however, the concept of Residual sovereignty is historically and analytically a correct way to understand the powers, the retained powers of the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.737" offset="1462908">And on the basis of this concept, together with the undesirable consequence that would follow with the Court of Appeals’ holding were affirmed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.580" offset="1498226">We contend that the doctrinal and the policy justifications that underly the dual sovereignty principle, apply in a tribal context even though the tribes are not states.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Urbanczyk</label>
            <text syncTime="407.107" offset="1708355">Well, the point I want to make with that is there are, as I understand it, no conditions imposed on payment of these appropriations for judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.799" offset="1747121">When you are dealing with the kind of Tribal Court which we described in the brief called CFR courts, the Courts of Indian Offenses; those are the qualifications and the involvement of the Secretary of the Interior or the Commissioner of the Indian Affairs with regard to the appointment of those judges and the payment of those judges is set forth in the regulation at 25 CFR 11.3, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.504" offset="1861955">But the point is that the Navajo Tribal Court is not a court of Indian offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.537" offset="1886092">Let me then briefly describe the considerations underlying the dual sovereignty principle and explain how they apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.611" offset="1922350">The key cases, of course, are Abbate and Lanza.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.143" offset="1936456">Those two cases set forth both a doctrinal explanation for the Dual Sovereignty principle and a policy justification which explains that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.918" offset="1975640">Now the doctrinal explanation for the Dual Sovereignty principle is simple and unremarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.440" offset="1997687">It is that the Fifth Amendment” applies to only proceedings by the Federal Government” and that is what is prohibited by the Double Jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment is two prosecutions by the Federal Government for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.771" offset="2059023">That is why in Lanza and Abbate the Double Jeopardy was held not to apply, there was only one prosecution by the Federal Government the other one was by the state whose courts do not derive their authority and their jurisdiction from the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.948" offset="2111686">Mr. Urbanczyk, would it impair your argument in any way if we were to decide in this Squamish case, a case that was argued earlier this week that the Indian Tribal right to prosecute is dependent upon an affirmative grant from Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.526" offset="2190053">I think that would about finish the principal submission of the government here, that the dual sovereignty principle applies precisely because that is not the case, because the tribal power is a retained power which has survived conquest and which the Federal Government continues to recognize.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.765" offset="4030954">Well with the permission is perhaps a correct way of thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.203" offset="4068779">If we are right that I should point out that one of the thing that respondents suggest is undermined that subsequent legislation and the Indian Civil Rights Act and I think it was a undermining thought and the Indian Civil Rights Act is based on the premise of thought and is good law and that without some sort of affirmative congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.367" offset="4149446">The tribal courts which are not creation of the constitution are not (Inaudible) formed by the constitution and so Congress imposed these many of the civil liberties in the First Ten Amendments upon tribal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.691" offset="4206706">Now if we are right that the Talton is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.097" offset="4216319">I think it establishes that not withstanding Federal Authority, Plenary Federal Authority, the proceedings of Navajo Tribal Code against responded in this case was not a prosecution under the authority of the Federal Government and if you do not agree with that proposition, I would submit that you would have to overrule Talton versus Mayes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.780" offset="4303046">On the other hand if you do agree with that preposition, I think it follows under the doctrinal justification for the dual sovereignty principle that the tribal prosecution was not a Federal prosecution and should not be construed as bar in federal prosecution that we we are talking about in this case today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.731" offset="4378905">Well that brings me to the policy justifications which animate the dual sovereignty principle, which I think have their most concise statement in Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion for the court in Abbate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.362" offset="4425403">Without such a principle, without the dual sovereignty principle the court said there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.918" offset="4443584">There inevitably would be a conflict between two independent governmental authorities, each lawfully asserting jurisdiction over the same subject matter that sometimes the assertion of jurisdiction by one forwarding the interest and prosecutorial interest of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.492" offset="4509935">The predicted result of such a conflict is that one governmental authority would be made to relinquish its jurisdiction in favor of the other and when the federal state conflict, it was assumed that in such a conflict, and the resolution of such a conflict might call for the state to give way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.949" offset="4579735">That is if the Congress could display state power to prosecute crimes based on acts which might also violate Federal Law but the court rejected that as a desirable solution to the problem, called it an undesirable consequence and I think basically that was the motivating factor for the reaffirmation of the dual sovereignty principle in this consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.384" offset="4681508">The consequences of not having a dual sovereignty principle, I think would be a substantial reallocation of the responsibilities for criminal law enforcement between the Federal Government and the State Governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.810" offset="4735215">Now, these same considerations I submit apply in much the same way in the tribal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.219" offset="4756845">We have two governments lawfully asserting criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.980" offset="4779833">In the case of a crime against an Indian committed by an Indian as such as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.332" offset="4805224">Tribal jurisdiction normally is exclusive with the exception of the major Crimes Act as to those the Federal Government has asserted jurisdiction and generally the tribes do not assert jurisdiction but Navajo tribal court for example, does not assert jurisdiction over offenses similar to those in the Major Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.065" offset="4884218">Generally, relatively more minor crimes proscribed in a Navajo Tribal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.995" offset="4903966">So we have two governments, each asserting substantially different jurisdictions in the same country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.775" offset="4927059">Both governments are seeking to pursue separate interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.154" offset="4944508">The tribe to project the peace and dignity of their tribe and tribal members against relatively minor offenses which otherwise probably would not be and I guess under existing structures could not be prosecuted by anyone else and then we have the Federal Government whose asserted jurisdiction over major crimes which threaten the peace and dignity not only of the tribe but of the nation and the country as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.359" offset="5049416">The Major Crimes Act, I think is an expression of Congress's intention or of its view that it prosecution of these major offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.899" offset="5135516">Well , of course the trial has jurisdiction only over tribal code offenses and the Federal Courts would not assert jurisdiction over tribal code offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.931" offset="5163624">But I would think that when you have an Indian defendant committing a crime against a non-Indian, so then instead of prosecuting under 1153, the Major Crimes Act, we were prosecuting under 18 U.S.C. 1152 that there might well be offenses which are brought into (Inaudible) on the tribes by federal enclave which are similar to tribal offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1396.699" offset="5666742">The respondent Wheeler submits that the Court of Appeals was correct when it held that successive prosecutions in tribal and federal court are barred at the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.247" offset="5708956">The decision is correct for two basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.528" offset="5722017">The Double Jeopardy Clause, dual sovereignty exception has never been applied outside of the Federal and state arena and secondly Indian tribes are in no way sovereign like state so as to allow the application of this exception to the successive tribal and federal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.936" offset="5791712">Additionally, the petitioners claims that the facts of the respondents case call for the application of other already recognized exceptions, the Double Jeopardy Clause must fail for the simple reason that the facts of this case do not support the application of any of these exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.903" offset="5871542">Before going any further, key facts must be noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.211" offset="5904770">These facts fully support the decision of the Court of Appeals and respondents claim that tribes are in fact arms of the federal sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.493" offset="5937893">From the arrest of the respondent Wheeler through his prosecution in the District Court, seven months later, the Bureau of Indian Affairs which is a Federal agency was in direct control of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.564" offset="5994213">Before the respondent was charged with the lesser included effect of contributing to the delinquency of the minor, the Bureau of Indian Affairs had already investigated the possible violation of Major Crimes Act offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.300" offset="10465122">I believe I make that statement in my brief, and I would like to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.686" offset="10482677">In this case the government is asking the court to recognize tribes as being sovereign like states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.973" offset="10515800">In Oliphant, the majority opinion in Oliphant recognized that tribes only have plenary powers and limited powers of self government and based their decision on the Residual sovereignty that the tribes retained absent any controlling or contrary Federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.594" offset="10590301">So assuming for purposes of arguments that the tribe does have Residual sovereignty which allows the tribe to prosecute non-Indians, this certainly does not raise them to the level of being sovereign like states, so as to allow the Dual Sovereignty exception to be extended with the Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.174" offset="10660623">So necessarily, I do not see any grading consistency although I do disagree whether the suggestion that Oliphant is good law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.728" offset="10710882">Well, the shoe can pinch the other way, can it too, because in this case you have an Indian tribe trying a member of the Tribe under the judicial self-government law and in all of them you have the Indian Tribe trying a non-Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.170" offset="10784652">Now you have Residual sovereignty for one purpose but not another.</text>

            <text syncTime="2683.570" offset="10814223">Well, in addition to the arguments that I have been making, I would submit as I have attempted to do up at this point that the notion of Residual sovereignty is no longer valid and that any notion of sovereignty as this court recognized in McClanahan has been merely used, Worcester versus Georgia when Justice Marshall first stated it, only as a means of resolving state and tribal conflict and as the court stated in McClanahan and it has done in the cases since McClanahan, it has avoided reliance on what it categorizes as a platonic notion of not a means of resolving disputes and has instead looked applicable to treaties and statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.006" offset="10995930">For example, in United States versus Mazurie which was mentioned in the arguments on Monday, this court examined the relationship of that particular tribe in the Federal Government and found that the tribe exercised powers of control over liquor on the reservation not because of any inherent sovereign but because of a delegation of that authority by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.881" offset="11091434">In United States versus Keeble, the Court was asked by the solicitor as it is being asked in this particular case to rely on a notion of inherent sovereignty to prevent an Indian member from asking the Court for a lesser included offense when it was clearly merit and the reason that the fact that the tribe had exclusive jurisdiction over that particular lesser included offense prevailed over that Indian member, a right to have a lesser included offense in the Federal Court instead of relying on that reasoning or even rejecting it, I believe the court merely looked at the applicable treaties and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.494" offset="11265932">And found that all of the Indians prosecuted in the Federal Court should be treated equally as any other defendant prosecutors in Federal Court and then recently in this Court's opinion in Antelope, the court again as I indicated earlier said that the Indian tribes were once sovereign and that any attributes of sovereignty and powers of self government were the result of the exercise of this Congress’s and the Federal Government’s plenary authority in pertinence of the word guarding relationship that exists between the tribes and the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.028" offset="11872077">The issue is really not of sovereignty but whether or not the violation by the member of the tribe of the Tribal court is an offense within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.451" offset="12837772">Further indication, I think of the real problem it involves brought this case to this position that is at today is indicated by the fact that took seven months to even bring this case to a Federal indictment, and the fact that the Indian Reservation is far removed from the US Attorney’s office in Phoenix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.912" offset="12911542">There is a constant problem of logistics and communication which is a various serious problem because of language barriers with Indians and these all add up to real problems which occasionally cause this type of a problem to arise where an Indian is convicted in the tribal court, prosecuted in the Federal Court without the government first becoming aware of the early prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.897" offset="13155526">I would merely thank you, Your Honor I would merely conclude by saying that under the very facts of this case not the other exception that the petitioner urges as being applicable so as to allow a second prosecution applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.876" offset="13211428">I think what the government is trying to do in this case Your Honor and I commend them for their ingenuity is to ask this court to enact Congressional policy where the Congress has not acted at this moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.729" offset="13278824">I think would be if this Court was to allow the Dual Sovereignty exception to be applied to successive tribal and Federal prosecutions would necessarily raise the very serious question of whether the court’s pronounced in Waller and particular in Puerto Rico versus the Shell company prohibiting successive prosecution within the Federal territory -- whether these cases are valid at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.642" offset="13390523">And one final note Your Honor, I submit that the case most fairly discusses and disposes of the various claims of the petitioners United States versus Kagama has made no indication by the government that, that case is overruled or that the language of that case is anything but dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.716" offset="13458755">I submit that it is very controlling and that case itself recognizes that Indian Tribes have been subsumed into the territory of the United States and exist only because of the political will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.269" offset="13500969">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.084" offset="13556244">I think it will have -- as far as the tribal structure itself the tribe will obviously lose its posture as being a self-governing independent entity and that way it necessarily will hurt the tribe and I think it is also significant to know that no amicus briefs are here today on behalf of the tribe as it were on Monday in the Oliphant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.487" offset="13693857">I think that the affirmance of Wheeler decision improves tribal sovereignty and gives finality to the tribal court's decision as well as Federal court decisions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Urbanczyk</label>
            <text syncTime="3420.560" offset="13762193">Just one or two very short points Mr. Chief Justice Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.265" offset="13777031">In answer to questions by Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Blackmun concerning the relationship of this case with Oliphant I want to make government’s position on that point clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.287" offset="13825096">This court could rule for Oliphant and still rule for the United States, I think that if the court rules for the Squamish, I think the government would have a very -- I think you would have to have reaffirmed that you have in all other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.165" offset="13896567">Concept that whatever powers are retained by the tribes are retained as an attribute of their sovereignty and I think if you do that then you have gone a long way towards deciding this case in the favor of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.539" offset="13938050">But if you rule for Oliphant I think there are several grounds for decision that are available to you and I think there is only one of those grounds that would hurt us substantially in this case and this is what I understood Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.515" offset="13993952">That is a if you rule in Oliphant that there was no longer any notion of tribal sovereignty and that the tribes existed simply as a creation of the Federal Government and that was a general, then I think our principal submission in this case would be in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.936" offset="14047659">Because I think we would have a hard time arguing that these tribes were not creations of the Federal Government and that the prosecutions under them were not under the authority of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.888" offset="14083499">But any other holding in favor of Oliphant in this case on the statutory ground I think would not effect of our position or would not be adverse to the government’s position of United States against Wheeler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.837" offset="14143268">One of the point concerning a statement by the government in the amicus brief in Oliphant that Talton has been mooted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.027" offset="14172002">That Footnote suggest simply that there is a open question at least it has been decided by this court, whether 1153 vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal Courts or whether or not the tribes would also have the current jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.604" offset="14230308">Two things about that first of all the Navajo Tribe, I want to make this clear does not assert jurisdictional over any major offense like those in the major Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.381" offset="14269491">But secondly I would suggest that the Indian Civil rights Act moots the question of whether or not there is concurrent jurisdiction with respect to major tribes in one sense and that is after the Indian Civil Rights Act which imposes substantial limitations on the power to sentence Indians are major offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.825" offset="14343261">That effectively disables them from punishing major offenses and in that sense it moots that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.743" offset="14366876">But it certainly does not moot Talton versus Mayes and we submit Talton Versus Mayes is still good law today.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Urbanczyk</label>
            <text syncTime="3589.614" offset="14438347">It is my understanding based on the 1970 version of the Navajo tribal court that they do not assert criminal jurisdiction over non Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.528" offset="14478053">They assert the right to exclude non members and non Indians from the reservation and they have a proceeding which is actually undertaken their executive branch of government to determine whether or not a person could be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.520" offset="14534059">He could be excluded for everything from a contagious disease to committing a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.153" offset="14556525">I am not aware of the current status of the Navajo jurisdiction is however.</text>
