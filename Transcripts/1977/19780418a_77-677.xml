            <text syncTime="71.138" offset="364522">We stand before this Court today on the case of Owen v. Kroger which has basically a single issue to present to you and the issue generally stated is on a State Court claim, can the plaintiff in a civil action in the Federal Court file a direct claim against a third party defendant with whom the plaintiff shares common citizenship or take it as just one step further in this particular case, gentlemen, what we have is a plaintiff who maintains a suit against a defendant who is not in comity with her citizenship, who files a third party complaint and that is our client in this particular case against a third party defendant and then the original defendant is excused from the proceedings on a motion for a summary judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.564" offset="650197">There was a hearing before district judge Denny.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.571" offset="662213">He sustained the motion for a summary judgment and that motion for a summary judgment was in fact appealed by the plaintiff in this case to the Eight Circuit Court which affirmed the judgment sustaining the motion for summary judgment.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="162.117" offset="728460">So at that stage, you had what parties?</text>

            <label>Mr. Emil F. Sodoro</label>
            <text syncTime="165.436" offset="741730">At that stage, after that original defendant was excused and I use that word appropriately I think, dismissed perhaps is a better word, Your Honor, dismissed from the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.857" offset="791363">What we had was an administratrix of an estate who was a citizen of Iowa who by this time now, had filed a direct claim in the original Federal District Court proceedings against the third party defendant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="195.863" stopTime="197.589">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="195.863" offset="863356">That was an amended complaint?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="emil_f_sodoro" startTime="197.589" stopTime="280.160">
            <label>Mr. Emil F. Sodoro</label>
            <text syncTime="197.589" offset="870252">Yes sir, Your Honor that was on the basis of an amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.170" offset="888643">So at this juncture, the original defendant is not longer a party to this case and what we have is that the plaintiff at this stage of the proceedings and the defendant for the purposes of diversity of citizenship which is a demand for jurisdiction in the Federal Court were both residents of the same state.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.167" offset="976623">Originally, this accident arises out of a complex set of facts and I am sure that you are aware of the facts and I would not belabor them with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.797" offset="1007134">But this is a suit for damages that arises out of a claim for wrongful death that occurred while the plaintiff’s decedent was in the course of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.776" offset="1051020">One of the issues or one of the matters that was also involved in this case that made it additionally complex to keep the parties straight, was that fact that when the plaintiff originally filed this suit, the employer of the plaintiff which was also an Iowa resident, the Paxton and Vierling Company was made a party defendant and federal district judge Denny in order to retain the jurisdiction, realigned the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.074" offset="1156241">That original defendant employer was made a defendant only for the purpose of subrogation of the workman’s compensation claims.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="280.160" stopTime="288.197">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="280.160" offset="1200545">To that extent the employer defendant would have had more in common with the plaintiffs than with the defendant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="emil_f_sodoro" startTime="288.197" stopTime="309.554">
            <label>Mr. Emil F. Sodoro</label>
            <text syncTime="288.197" offset="1232727">That is right Your Honor and it was for that reason as I say that the trial judge, judge Denny realigned that party and in effect made the Paxton Vierling Company which was an employer, a party claimant for the purpose of retaining jurisdiction of the case and as you say, their interests were in fact aligned.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="309.554" stopTime="312.614">
            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="309.554" offset="1318200">That is a new lawsuit then?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="emil_f_sodoro" startTime="312.614" stopTime="320.765">
            <label>Mr. Emil F. Sodoro</label>
            <text syncTime="312.614" offset="1330425">It was really part of the original lawsuit as was treated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.367" offset="1349443">What happened was the parties were simply realigned, Justice Marshall.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="320.765" stopTime="324.982">
            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="320.765" offset="1363026">You realigned them because you lost the regular party?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="emil_f_sodoro" startTime="324.982" stopTime="420.644">
            <label>Mr. Emil F. Sodoro</label>
            <text syncTime="324.982" offset="1379849">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.829" offset="1383297">Actually, as the case was originally filed and you have got it exactly, there was no diversity of citizenship that would confer jurisdiction on the Federal District Court because there was no federal question involved and by the admission of the plaintiff in that original complaint, one of the parties was a resident of the same state as was the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.219" offset="1460829">I am glad that you noticed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.477" offset="1469815">But in any event, this case finally came for trial and the question as to the jurisdiction of the Court and it is our contention that the Federal District Court never had any jurisdiction to hear and decide the case between the petitioner that stands before you today and the respondent for the reason and again very simply stated this is not a complex case, at least as we view it because there was no diversity of citizenship between the respective parties that were involved in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.331" offset="1609309">Judge Denny, the trier of the case and his declaration is in the record, said that felt that this was a case where he had to decide whether it was a matter of pendant or ancillary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.439" offset="1665733">Now, we have searched the authorities, every authority possible and it seems that there is not any question that the Federal Courts, once they have the original jurisdiction between a plaintiff and a diverse defendant that that defendant may make a third party defendant who is a resident or a citizen of the same state as the original defendant, no question about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.114" offset="1820378">If the third party defendant is of the same residence as the original defendant, then there is no problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.788" offset="1847127">If you are talking about a third party practice, bringing in a defendant who is of the same citizenship as the original plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.492" offset="1881923">I see no problem with that, but the problem that arises here, Justice Stewart is in that, the plaintiff in this case was permitted to file a direct claim, do you not see against that third party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.576" offset="1938243">Now, we can find no cases in any jurisdictions in the Federal Court that permit such a practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.713" offset="1962798">Let alone find any case particularly where the original defendant is removed or excused or dismissed from the case that permits any such practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.269" offset="2005012">Gentlemen, it would be really I think a waste of your time for me to reiterate and to read to you the portions of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.018" offset="2031970">I am sure you are acquainted with that, but it was our feeling and it is our contention today that Judge Denny was mistaken, that this is not a case for determination as to whether or not it is a matter of pendant or ancillary jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.425" offset="2097694">Is your position dependent all on the fact that the original defendant was dismissed out of the case?</text>

            <text syncTime="512.659" offset="2130608">Our principal argument is that the plaintiff could not do what she did here because she was not entitled to do it under federal practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.499" offset="2169896">There was no jurisdiction that would inure to the Federal Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.083" offset="6972247">Ultimately, then Omaha Public Power District impleaded Owen Erection and Equipment Company, the defendant in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.680" offset="7042674">We took the parties as we found them a party that had been impleaded by the original defendant, the third party plaintiff, that there is no suggestion of anything other than that in this case and I might say further that with respect to one of the traditional lines of reasoning and that is that this gives rise to collusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.427" offset="7177674">To the contrary our battle against the Omaha Public Power District predured and went all the way to the United States Court of Appeals.</text>
