            <label>Mr. Joel H. Kaplan</label>
            <text syncTime="16.242" offset="144880">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.287" offset="153135">Mr. Chief Justice and May I please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.571" offset="166196">This case concerns several issues regarding alleged racial discrimination in hiring and recruiting under civil rights laws, principally, Title 7, 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.319" offset="213216">More particularly, the case brings into focus questions relating to, one, what constitutes legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for refusing to hire minority applicants under McDonnell Douglas?</text>
            <text syncTime="45.071" offset="260237">Second, the standard of review to be applied by Court of Appeals after District Court has found an employer’s refusal to hire were legitimate and non-discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.605" offset="302346">Also, the Court of Appeals’ authority unrestrained by either the evidence in the record or the District Court’s finding to create its own hiring system.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.307" offset="345187">Third, it deals with the use and probative value of statistics by a defendant in Title 7 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.991" offset="375907">And, particularly whether under Title 7, a hiring process which resulted in the hiring of black bricklayers, far in excess of their statistical availability in the relevant labor market can be fragmented into its various subparts.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.512" offset="434003">Finally, it raises the issue of whether discriminatory intent or motive or essential elements to a prima facie case of disparate treatment under McDonnell Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.109" offset="476426">The genesis of this case is the relining of the blast furnace by Furnco at Interlake, Inc. in the late summer and early fall of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.635" offset="518431">Performing this work, Furnco hired fire bricklayers, a very unique bricklaying craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.663" offset="554585">The agencies confronting Furnco in performing this work, in terms of the speed it had to perform it, in terms of the quality of the work that had to be performed and the risks of doing it in untimely or improper manner are set forth at length in our brief and also in the District Court’s findings that need not be recounted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.555" offset="642147">In meeting these needs, Furnco, through its Job Superintendent, followed three fundamental hiring policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.117" offset="680390">First, it only hired bricklayers known by its superintendent or recommended to them as such to be experienced and highly competent in this unique skill of bricklaying.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.916" offset="731590">It essentially hired bricklayers with a proven track record of skill and ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.901" offset="755519">Second, it did not accept applications from anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.480" offset="773909">It did not hire at the gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.581" offset="782268">It is undisputed that neither Blacks nor Whites were hired at the gate.</text>

            <text syncTime="192.994" offset="851963">It is alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.849" offset="855306">I think you are referring to both the amici's and the respondent’s point that Mr. Samuels and Mr. Smith were not hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.703" offset="882787">The first point issued in our reply brief we pointed out at length is that Donald Samuels had never worked for days, as I questioned in their by myself, “did you ever worked for Mr. Dacies?”</text>
            <text syncTime="210.275" offset="921030">Answered “no, I had not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="211.875" offset="927404">So, he had never worked for Mr. Dacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.608" offset="934405">The second gentleman, Mr. William Smith, was hired on this job.</text>

          <turn speaker="joel_h_kaplan" startTime="224.138" stopTime="259.981">
            <label>Mr. Joel H. Kaplan</label>
            <text syncTime="224.138" offset="976514">No, Your honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.100" offset="980381">The evidence shows that Mr. Smith had worked for Mr. Dacies previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.509" offset="1009951">At one point, Mr. Dacies had met Mr. Smith at the job site and said words in effect “Smithy, what are you doing here?</text>
            <text syncTime="239.138" offset="1036492">Go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.567" offset="1038163">I am going to hire you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="241.024" offset="1044015">The evidence shows that Mr. Smith was hired in a non-discriminatory sequence of hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.833" offset="1071287">He was hired before White bricklayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.886" offset="1083512">For example, he was hired before seven White bricklayers who were purportedly on this list and worked longer than 11 White bricklayers who were purportedly on this list.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel H. Kaplan</label>
            <text syncTime="263.518" offset="1133981">I think the list is really a red heiring in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.620" offset="1150385">The list signified persons who were known by Dacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.055" offset="1164178">Mr. Dacies had Mr. Smith’s name in his head rather than on a piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.096" offset="1180374">He was hired because he knew Dacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.878" offset="1191450">He was hired in a manner that was not dissimilar to the way White bricklayers were hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.680" offset="1226663">In that regard, the evidence showed that Blacks worked on the average, the same number of days as White bricklayers and were hired throughout the whole sequence of the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.103" offset="1284341">The third policy pursued by Furnco in hiring on this job was that it sought to recruit and hire Black bricklayers who were experienced and skilled in fire bricklayering in numbers substantially in excess of their statistical presence in the relevant labor force.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.147" offset="1364485">The District Court found and the evidence showed that during the relevant time period, 5.7% of the bricklayers in the relevant labor market were Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.055" offset="1412132">On the Interlake job, Furnco worked Black bricklayers 13.3% of the man-days.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.518" offset="1442016">Essentially, Black bricklayers worked on this job at two-and-a half times their availability in the labor force.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.375" offset="1549432">The list were various scraps of paper that Mr. Dacies kept that contained the names of various bricklayers he had worked with and who were skilled in firebricking.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.623" offset="1618395">However, Mr. Smith was known by Mr. Dacies and he was hired because he was known by Mr. Dacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.787" offset="1659042">To get right to that issue then of the list that seems to be all pervasive in this case, the all-White list is a very catchy slogan.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.493" offset="1701883">It is wholly unrelated to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.463" offset="1709824">It is a red herring.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.237" offset="1740857">However, prior to the job, Mr. Dacies was instructed by the company’s General Manager to make sure that Black bricklayers were hired on this job in numbers substantially in excess of their ability in the labor force.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.300" offset="1805119">Mr. Dacies wanted new Black bricklayer prior to this job and, prior to the job, contacted another Furnco Superintendent in the area to obtain the names of other Black bricklayers.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.096" offset="1892368">The critical point is that prior to the hiring of bricklayers in this job, Mr. Dacies had the names of Black and White bricklayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.201" offset="1932701">He was hiring from an integrated pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.587" offset="1950255">By hiring from this integrated pool, the evidence shows that he was able to accomplish an integrated workforce, integrated in terms of days’ work, in terms of numbers hired, in terms of every conceivable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.294" offset="2041161">One additional point, there is no showing that this purported all-White list was the exclusive avenue for obtaining work in this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.527" offset="2090062">It was only one of several recruitment sources used by the Job Superintendent in hiring on this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.217" offset="2120782">The very fact that Blacks were hired in the numbers, they were evidences that fact that it was not exclusive, that being on the list was not a prerequisite for being hired.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.943" offset="2235721">As I was noting, the District Court had found that the hiring policies we pursued on this job were legitimate, non-discriminatory and had ruled in our favor against all eight plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.215" offset="2300818">The Court of Appeals reversed this at three and affirmed this to five.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.818" offset="2339166">The Court of Appeals, in doing so, completely ignored the legitimate non-discriminatory nature of Furnco’s hiring on this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.866" offset="2387440">Its decision is totally at odds with the evidence before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.421" offset="2405621">It also chose to ignore the statistics in this case demonstrating the absence of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.562" offset="2442193">This court has often said that in racial discrimination cases, statistics tell much.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.503" offset="2593912">The case is whether or not you can infer racial discrimination from what is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.954" offset="2615750">I think what statistics said that in the absence of such blatant kinds of purposeful discrimination, “no Blacks need apply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="640.825" offset="2643231">There was no sign at the gate “Blacks need not apply.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.928" offset="4471698">Concentrating on the all-White list is wrong not only because there was an integrated pool prior to the job, but it also represents an attempt to fragment and parsed the hiring process to look at each individual source of hiring and saying “what is the racial, ethnic, sexual, religious composition of that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.188" offset="4568665">rather than looking at the results of the entire hiring process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.286" offset="4589040">I suggest that that kind of parsing up is not only inconsistent with the case law, but leads to ludicrous results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.720" offset="4622790">That, no employer in this country would not have a hiring system that did not discriminate if that was a rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.752" offset="4710980">Indeed, there is no evidence to show that the hiring system found “feasible” by the Court of Appeals or urged by the Court of Appeals would have passed muster under that kind of standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.528" offset="4774092">One of the fatal defects of the Court of Appeals’ system is that there is no showing that it would have created job opportunities for Blacks in excess of what our system created.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.366" offset="5533419">The question relating prior thereto was to the list, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.311" offset="5549197">There is no showing that if we had hired at the gate, that it would have resulted in the same kind of non-discriminatory hiring that we in fact had on this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.849" offset="5635296">We were talking about the fragmenting of the hiring system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.766" offset="5655045">It seems to me that Title 7 does not prescribe that there are good hiring systems and bad hiring systems in terms of the kinds of ways you recruit workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.860" offset="5711365">It does not say you have to go to help wanted ads or TV advertising or write letters to every potential applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.858" offset="5735398">It says “whether or not the sources that you chose or the recruitment sources you use, whether or not those are discriminatory or non-discriminatory, whether or not they have a disparate impact on Blacks or any other protected minority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.170" offset="5796629">The answer in this case is that the selection of recruitment sources that we chose did not have such a disparate impact and that to fragment and parse up the system totally distorts the hiring process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.246" offset="5888893">One of the points also raised in the certiorari petition that I would like to comment on for a moment is the question of whether intent or motive is a necessary element to a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.156" offset="5976560">I believe that such a showing is necessary to show that there is a nexus between the prohibited criteria and the action taken, that there is a nexus between refusing to hire a Black and the fact that you are refusing to hire him on that prohibited basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.143" offset="6076557">I think that the showing of intent and motive are necessary element of the most analogous statute, such as the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.400" offset="6149491">What I am suggesting here is that the circumstantial evidence in this case completely dispels any notion that persons were hired or not hired because of their skin color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.080" offset="6192227">That evidence, again, is not only the statistics and the non-discriminatory sequence of hiring, but also the treatment of Blacks on the job.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.764" offset="6451048">The issue of this all-White list is not a red heiring in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.391" offset="6469543">That is precisely why this lawsuit was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.485" offset="6481873">This company has, for years, hired through Mr. Dacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.365" offset="6501412">Mr. Dacies is a White superintendent who has run jobs and worked on jobs. He has worked with competent Whites and competent Blacks since 1958 and he never put a Black man on his list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.414" offset="6553553">He used that list not to fill isolated jobs but to fill, in this instance, 90% of the jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.600" offset="6578317">According to his testimony, he used it to fill every job except in those instances where his boss said “on this job, Mr. Dacies, you must hire some percentage of Blacks.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.034" offset="6616038">In that instance, he went out and recruited some Blacks to fill some jobs in alternative methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.106" offset="6636413">It is not a small little practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.707" offset="6642787">It is the practice that this man testified, he used to fill all the jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.439" offset="6661700">He testified that he could do it that way because he had ample names on his list and that this work was so lucrative that he had no trouble going out and recruiting people to come and work for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.721" offset="6702869">There are three basic facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.338" offset="6713318">Number one, the plaintiffs in this case are fully qualified and competent bricklayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.920" offset="6731603">They are men who have worked in this industry between 18 and 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.903" offset="6751561">Consequently, all of the discussion in defendant’s briefs about the skills necessary to perform this kind of work do not apply to these plaintiffs because they are fully skilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.158" offset="6792521">They simply want the opportunity to use those skills on jobs run by Furnco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.976" offset="6811852">Secondly, there is not piece of evidence in this record that a single bricklayer hired on this job was as qualified or more qualified than the Blacks that were seeking work at this job.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.385" offset="6885517">The man selected to run this job was Mr. Dacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.796" offset="6899101">He had unfettered discretion as to who he would hire and how he would hire for all but those limited number of jobs for which he was ordered to hire some number of Blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.984" offset="6971825">It is apparent from this record that the Blacks that were hired come only from two sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.219" offset="6992828">Number one, he testified that when he got on the job and he was told to hire some Blacks, he told his boss “I do not know the telephone numbers of any Blacks, therefore I called Mr. Abanski at another job that Furnco was running.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.007" offset="7039953">Mr. Abanski says “I will see if I have some who could do the work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.781" offset="7051029">Then, Mr. Abanski subsequently sent him some names.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.376" offset="7077465">Furnco proudly tells us that these are examples of people that Dacies knew and that he hired because he knew him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.693" offset="7102751">They give us three examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.270" offset="7109021">They tell us “that is Mr. Branch.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.967" offset="7115812">They tell us “that is Mr. Jones and that is Mr. Smith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.233" offset="7128874">As to those three people, the record shows that Mr. Jones testified that he was never called by Dacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.246" offset="7148936">He got a telephone call one night from his superintendent on the other job and they said “you better get over to the Interlake job tomorrow,” and he reported to work the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.241" offset="7192926">Nobody disputed that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.457" offset="7201808">The supervisor and Mr. Jones disputed that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.341" offset="7213301">Mr. Branch is not a bricklayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.061" offset="7220198">He was called a gun-eyed man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.995" offset="7227930">There is nothing in the record as to why Mr. Branch was selected to go and perform the gun-eyed work on this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.238" offset="7252903">As to Mr. Smith, we will show in our argument that he was not selected with the Whites who were on Mr. Dacies’ list.</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.859" offset="13271411">We think that Mr. Samuels was at that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.594" offset="13282278">We think that the evidence in this case was that Samuels worked at the US Steel Southworks job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.701" offset="13306728">Mr. Dacies worked the US Steel Southworks job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.735" offset="13314879">Mr. Dacies takes credit for having worked at that job when several Blacks were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.396" offset="13329507">Mr. Samuels was one of the first Blacks hired on that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.355" offset="13341314">Mr. Samuel says “I did not work for Mr. Dacies,” when he was asked that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.009" offset="13355943">It turns out, in fact, he was hired by Mr. Larkin and he worked for Mr. Larkin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.552" offset="13370154">But, to clarify that, I asked Mr. Dacies “name the Blacks who were on that job when you were there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.194" offset="13392723">The imposing counsel objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.326" offset="13401292">Now, they say “had we not objected and had we let him answer that question, he would have said no and he would not have named Samuels” and they pointed out some interrogatories which were not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.056" offset="13448208">I would say that, based on the evidence we have where Samuels was on that job, Dacies says there were several Black men there and Samuels was one of the first there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.063" offset="13480181">It is more likely than not that they were there together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.357" offset="13489376">But, the Trial Court made no finding on that important question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.426" offset="13505677">I do not think that the evidence in the interrogatories disputes particular in light of their objection to my question.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3361.881" offset="13527515">Does Samuel’s case depend whether or not he was?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="judson_h_miner" startTime="3365.045" stopTime="3455.898">
            <label>Mr. Judson H. Miner</label>
            <text syncTime="3365.045" offset="13540159">No, even if he was not in Smith’s class, he is in the same position as Nemhard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.244" offset="13560952">As for Nemhard, we would submit that the intentional discrimination still exclude him from the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.116" offset="13580387">The analysis goes something like this, Mr. Dacies created an all-White list during the period prior to this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.733" offset="13614869">His intention in creating that list was not limited to excluding the Smiths and people he worked with in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.813" offset="13635244">His intention is just as much to have an all-White list to use in the future and, therefore, to exclude those Blacks who will come down the road in the future for jobs that he is looking at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.504" offset="13673905">Consequently, when he applies that list to a Black who is coming down in the future, that race is a factor in the decision of the use of that list, viz-a-viz that Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.292" offset="13713089">Furthermore, the other side of the coin, once as this court has said in Keys, when you have intentional discrimination as to one side of a practice, you have to infer discrimination to the other side of the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.384" offset="13749452">The other side of the practice is the no hiring at the gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.862" offset="13763349">The inference of that intentional discriminatory is fully buttressed by Mr. Dacies’ treatment of the Blacks who came to the job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.389" offset="13789471">His deceptive treatment of them, his refusal to tell them how they can go about getting jobs, he almost runs Nemhard over with his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.583" offset="13818310">Smith testifies at a later date that he had a conversation with Dacies in which Dacies said “if you had not been with those other guys, I would have hired you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.082" offset="13856240">This is certainly not consistent with an attitude of a man who is out to offer a new equal opportunity to Blacks looking for work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.829" offset="13911306">I have a few points to make, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.214" offset="13920815">First of all, in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Seventh Circuit deals at A7 of the Appendix to the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.753" offset="13962924">It says “the historical inequality of treatment of Black workers seems to establish that it is prima facie racial discrimination, etcetera.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.279" offset="14001063">There is no reference to Dacies’ list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.399" offset="14009527">There is no reference to any overturning of the District Court’s findings that there was no pretext, no intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.232" offset="14036903">That is number one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3501.425" offset="14085595">But they are concerned in regard to Dacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.410" offset="14093536">What they seem to be concerned about was societal discrimination against Black workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.425" offset="14109628">That is how I read the sentence, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3564.229" offset="14336893">Mr. Smith was specifically recruited.</text>

            <text syncTime="3579.833" offset="14399274">Answer, “Yes” from Mr. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.353" offset="14417350">I think the briefs satisfy my concerns to record that this court be fully apprised with the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.649" offset="14454549">The point I want to come back to is how should Furnco have hired on this job?</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.212" offset="14480776">The EOC and the US Government concede that our hiring system was legitimate and non-discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.786" offset="14507107">The District Court had found beyond a reasonable doubt that our hiring system was legitimate and non-discriminatory, that it met Furnco’s business needs as well as not discriminating against Blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.681" offset="14562696">There is no evidence in the record that the system found “feasible” by the Seventh Circuit would have met our business needs and have led to as many Blacks being hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.386" offset="14613478">Indeed, the vice of the Furnco’s hiring system, the Seventh Circuit said that it was subjective, that somehow the job superintendent was making subjective judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.455" offset="14665723">But, the vice of the Seventh Circuit’s system is that it is equally subjective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.048" offset="14680142">Indeed, it is even more subjective than our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.984" offset="14691845">Our system was premised upon knowledge of a person’s ability to do this very specialized skill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.019" offset="14727999">It was not premised upon what strangers had to say in terms of recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.086" offset="14752240">I would like to make one last point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.894" offset="14763525">There is no evidence in the record that Furnco had ever engaged in any discrimination prior to this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.079" offset="14808247">There is no finding of any court or administrative agency that has been upheld that Furnco had discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.017" offset="14836041">The accusation is totally false.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.642" offset="14850461">Given the backdrop of no discrimination and the statistics on this job and the legitimacy of the hiring system in terms of meeting our business needs, I do not believe that there was any racial discrimination in this case and I respectfully request that you reverse the Court of Appeals as to those three respondents.</text>
