            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="90.719" offset="443020">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.321" offset="465485">This case is here on appeal from a Three-Judge District Court in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.134" offset="496727">The question involved is the constitutional validity, particularly under Article 1 Section 10 but also under the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clauses of the constitution of the Multistate Tax Compact and of the appellee, the Multistate Tax Commission, which administers the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.087" offset="604561">The text of the Multistate Tax Compact is set forth at pages 54 through 79 of the white bound Appendix to the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.585" offset="670494">I may say that the record in this case is really contained in two documents, the papers which we filed in connection with the jurisdictional statement and that includes the text of the Multistate Tax Compact at pages 54-79 and then the brown-covered Appendix in which we did not undertake to reprint those things which had already been put before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.717" offset="787000">At the time this suit was brought, 21 states were members of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.101" offset="812600">Since that time, four states: Illinois, Florida, Wyoming, and Indiana have withdrawn from the compact while two states: California and South Dakota have joined in.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.789" offset="875294">Thus, there are now 19 states, members of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.545" offset="902357">The basic question arises under Article 1 Section 10 of the constitution and the language which I am sure would have seemed clear to Mr. Justice Black that no state shall without the consent of Congress enter into any agreement or compact with another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.556" offset="990442">The simple fact is that Congress has never given its consent to the Multistate Tax compact though that compact went into effect by its terms when seven states had joined it on August 4th, 1967 now more than 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.659" offset="1074765">As indicated by the references on page 10 of our main brief, the blue-covered brief, the consent of Congress has been sought repeatedly but has never been granted.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="281.196" offset="1204959">Has this court ever had occasion to address the question of whether an agreement from which a state could withdraw at any time was a compact within the meaning of the clause you are relying on?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="295.664" stopTime="557.004">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="295.664" offset="1262847">No, I am not sure that this court has ever dealt with that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.742" offset="1279147">I can only say that Congress has dealt with it in 100-150 incidences and has ratified compact from which a state could withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.577" offset="1326481">Certainly, the practical construction is that that is the practical construction by the legislative branches, that that is a compact within the meaning of the Article 1 Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.216" offset="1384995">The Three-Judge District Court held that the consent of Congress was not prerequisite to the validity of this compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.849" offset="1415611">It also found no merit in the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.228" offset="1437135">Accordingly, it granted a motion for a summary judgment in favor of the appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.058" offset="1464407">An appeal was taken and this court noted probable jurisdiction on February 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.131" offset="1500665">Beyond the apparent clarity of the constitutional language, we rely on the substance of the constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.962" offset="1540058">This substance is, I think, given meaning by the long continued practice of Congress and the states in giving effect to the constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.502" offset="1586138">In order to put that practice before the court, we have included two rather lengthy appendixes in our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.001" offset="1624172">This is the somewhat dark blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.530" offset="1642249">These appear at pages 53 through 120 of the blue-covered brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.114" offset="1676626">The first of these, beginning on page 53, lists in chronological order every Compact to which Congress has given its consent from the beginning through the year 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.127" offset="1756665">These are listed by title and with our statutory citations, there are something like 150 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.283" offset="1797312">I may say that on page 53, there are a number of typographical corrections, I would call the court’s attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.026" offset="1836287">In the first place, the first compact listed: Virginia and Kentucky Compact and the second and third from the last one listed: Virginia and West Virginia Debt Agreement, Virginia and West Virginia Boundary Agreements of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.462" offset="1902011">I do not think they are compacts at all and I think we should not have listed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.505" offset="1918207">The first one is the Act admitting Kentucky to the union and the second and third from the bottom are two Acts connected with the admission of West Virginia to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.804" offset="1979438">In the second supplement, we have reprinted a list compiled by the Council of State Governments in a publication which it put out in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.668" offset="2038892">This lists the compacts up to that time in alphabetical order.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.706" offset="2063029">To some extent, it duplicates the list which we have in the first supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.385" offset="2085704">But, the second list also gives additional information, particularly a list of references to the states which are parties to the several compacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.592" offset="2130530">As I have said, it only goes through 1866 since we were reprinting it from another publication we did not feel free to make insertions of the additional ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.440" offset="2173893">But, the compacts to which Congress has given its consent since 1966 are set out in chronological order on pages 68 through 70 of the first supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.692" offset="2242961">Finally, we have included on page 121, a list derived from the Council of State Government’s publication showing the compacts which were an operation in 1966 which had not received the consent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.126" offset="2352675">Some of these compacts may be invalid for the lack of that consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.822" offset="2375454">I would mention particularly the Southern Regional Education Compact which was in its origin and effort to getting around this court’s decision in the Games case involving the education of a Negro outside of Missouri, when Missouri maintained a law school for White students exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.066" offset="2464479">The House passed a joint resolution of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.374" offset="2481720">The Senate debated it extensively over a period of several days and, eventually, voted to recommit the Bill by a vote of 38:37.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.610" offset="2526651">After a suggestion had been made that adaption of the consent resolution would amount to an approval by Congress of the segregation which was implicit in the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.003" offset="2592166">In that connection, I would call attention to the fact that the Western Regional Education Compact was consented to by Congress in 1953 only five years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.486" offset="2646082">No question of segregation was involved there.From this listing, it appears that Congress has given its consent to a wide range of compacts between the several states and that it has given its consent to a very high proportion of the compacts, more than 90%, which have been put into operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1155.739" offset="4703173">The problem arises because of a dictum of this court in Virginia against Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.770" offset="4735251">It was clearly a dictum as is shown in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.698" offset="4758971">The court held that Congress had given its consent long ago informally but effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.162" offset="4804842">Having held that, the court then said it is evident that the prohibition of Article 1, Section 10 is directed to the formation of any compact tending to the increase of political power in the states which may encroach upon or interfere with the justice supremacy of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.006" offset="4904211">I would point out first that not only was that a dictum but it was a hard case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.767" offset="4927199">It was a case where the boundary line had been established and accepted for 90 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.079" offset="4956456">It involved a one time, one place bilateral agreement and the same is true of this court’s more recent decision in New Hampshire against Maine, a year ago on which the court below also relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.763" offset="5019255">There, the boundary was established in 1740 by an order of the Privy Council in England more than 200 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.654" offset="5050811">The agreement before the court was simply a stipulation to settle a lawsuit involving a controversy as to the exact location of the boundary over the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.613" offset="5094592">I would have thought it would have been easier for the court simply to hold that since the constitution gives the court jurisdiction over suit between two states that a stipulation between the party settling that case, approved by the court was not a compact to which Article 1 Section 10 applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.716" offset="5183095">The essential fact, as I have said, here is that this court has never upheld the validity of a modern compact,I may say the modern period in compact really begins about 1921 with the Colorado River Compact, the Port of New York Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.522" offset="5258223">Since then, there have been a substantial number of compacts involving multistate agreements with administrative bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.535" offset="5298347">The court has never given its consent to a modern compact involving many states and creating an independent administrative commission to which Congress has not given its consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.767" offset="5363235">Indeed, since almost all compacts have sought and obtained the consent of Congress, few questions covering the validity of compacts, lacking Congressional consent have reached this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.770" offset="5419242">The cases which have come here have all involved one time, one place bilateral boundary agreements and have virtually no application to a wide-ranging multistate agreement such as that now before the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.605" offset="7010621">Here, there is a very clear national interest involved as is evidenced by the pending treaty with the United Kingdom, the avoidance of double taxation treaty with the United Kingdom, which contains a provision insisted upon by the United Kingdom and a number of other countries are also concerned with it preventing the use of one of the practices of the Multistate Tax Commission called combination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.433" offset="7157952">We have gone into it in some detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.414" offset="7173834">The Chairman of the Multistate Tax Commission has appeared before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, an opposition to that provision of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.513" offset="7218242">The task force on foreign income of the Ways and Means Committee has recommended that this provision be held inapplicable in foreign taxation and a recommendation has been made to the President that this be included in his current tax program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.869" offset="7287624">This seems to me to be the clearest possible illustration of the fact that the activities of the Multistate Tax Commission do impinge upon the powers and authority of the United States and that they ought not to be allowed to be put into effect unless and until the compact has obtained the consent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.645" offset="7906726">There are several issues and questions that have been raised by Mr. Griswold, the argument that I think needs to be clarified and clarified immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.918" offset="7959807">The first issue is the one that is implicit in listing compacts or agreements which have been approved by Congress and the reference to the fact that the Multistate Tax Compact was submitted to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.280" offset="8041309">First, it should be realized that two states in asking for admission to the compact and enacting the compact specifically made provision in their admission legislation for Congressional approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.939" offset="8119885">Congressional approval needed to be sought on that ground.Secondly, it certainly was a matter of expediency to do so, but the Attorney General’s opinion, the opinions of counsel to the commission clearly indicated that under the Virginia versus Tennessee test which have been the controlling test for a number of years, no Congressional consent was not required.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.436" offset="8225942">Which Attorney General’s opinion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_d_dexter" startTime="2038.039" stopTime="2255.403">
            <label>Mr. William D. Dexter</label>
            <text syncTime="2038.039" offset="8232316">The Attorney General of Washington and the Attorney General’s opinion of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.512" offset="8270246">Those were two opinions that were issued and, there, they indicated that Congressional consent was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.007" offset="8300234">They looked at the provisions of the compact in light of the history and language of the test to be employed to determine its constitutionality of Virginia versus Tennessee and decided that this was not the kind of a compact or agreement which needed Congressional consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.975" offset="8368048">We simply say that the fact that compacts are submitted to Congress for Congressional consent are a matter of political expedience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.629" offset="8434713">For instance, the Great Lakes Basin Compact which the appellants refered to in their brief, which was submitted to Congress finally for consent, the statement in the Congressional record regarding that consent simply says that in view of the dispute concerning the necessity for the compact it seems clear that it would be more prudent to secure Congressional consent rather than to forego consent and thereby throw a doubt on the validity of the compact and on the commission’s activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.576" offset="8574520">I submit that the taking and throwing together all of the compacts that Congress has approved and then telling this court that that is the constitutional test, that is what the compact means under the constitution is not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.563" offset="8650380">We rather believe that the appropriate test to determine the validity of a compact including the compact in question is to look at the judicial history concerning that Compact Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.096" offset="8700535">In Virginia versus Tennessee, it is true that the language of Justice Field was dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.136" offset="8724672">It is also true that he went at great lengths to explain and understand the purpose and meaning of the Compact Clause in the United States constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.923" offset="8771901">He, in that decision, laid down a test, a standard by which that clause could be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.741" offset="8807114">It was a test for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.136" offset="8816727">It was a test for all kinds of compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.445" offset="8829998">Then, in that decision, he went ahead and applied that test to determine the validity of the compact in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.060" offset="8868450">This court in New Hampshire versus Maine followed exactly the same procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.879" offset="8891647">The first question is what does the Compact Clause mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.911" offset="8907842">Not in the context of a boundary dispute but in the context of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.155" offset="8932815">This court, there, referred to the Virginia versus Tennessee test and simply gave the Compact Clause that interpretation and then turned around and applied it to the boundary agreement there involved and found no Congressional consent was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.649" offset="9014735">Since Virginia versus Tennessee, the State Courts have uniformly followed that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.570" offset="9046500">That test simply is whether or not a compact increases the political power of the states in a manner which tends to impinge or encroach upon just federal supremacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2279.221" offset="9197070">It simply said that the Compact Clause did not mean all agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.357" offset="9213580">It meant those political types of agreements which would tend to interfere or encroach upon federal supremacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.592" offset="9478566">In that case, the court recognized that, by reciprocal legislation which was in the nature of an agreement, each court was really extending its enforcement powers cooperatively by agreement in other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2632.869" offset="10611653">The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York requires what they call a 9G statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.176" offset="11408910">I would like to indicate that Article 12 of the compact contains a Severability Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.813" offset="11435451">Under that clause, it is incumbent upon the appellant to show what provisions, if any, of the compact were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.025" offset="11480277">Only those provisions become inoperative under Article 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.348" offset="11497622">The remainder of the provisions remain in full force and effect.You have to take Virginia versus Tennessee test or whatever test this court wishes to apply in interpreting the compact clause and look at it in reference to each of the compact provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.869" offset="11575676">I would suggest that the only real issue in this clause is whether or not the tax administrators of the member states can join together in a cooperative audit program and to authorize the commission of which they are members to act as their auditing agent in order to enforce their own tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.579" offset="11698451">Now, to understand that this is the only issue, it is necessary to quickly refer to the substantive provisions of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.922" offset="11735859">I have already commented on Article 3 and Article 4.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.538" offset="11994367">Paragraph 3 of Article 6 of the compact gives the commission only the authority to study, to recommend, and to issue proposals that would aid in the uniform application and the relief of compliance problems in state and local tax math.</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.123" offset="12300626">The Article 8 does grant the Tax Commission as the auditing agent of a tax administrator to go to the ports of member states to enforce that subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.440" offset="12377949">This authority is no different than the authority that each individual tax administrator has on his own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.398" offset="12425805">This led the Supreme Court of Washington in the Hertz case and the Three-Judge Court below to conclude that there was no ship to power among the states by the subpoena power and that there was no encroachment on federal supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.133" offset="12504695">All that the commission is doing is standing in the state of the tax administrator of each state as his agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.888" offset="12539699">It is true that Article 8 of the compact permits the commission to go into any member state that has adapted Article 8 and enforce that subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.186" offset="12584943">But, it submitted that this extension or increase of state power is specifically upheld by this court in New York versus the O’Neill case that the courts can make arrangements among themselves and agree to make their ports available to enforce the laws of another states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.695" offset="12666967">There is a whole series of reciprocal legislation or agreements in the nature of reciprocal legislation that the states utilize for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.876" offset="12723705">It should also be realized that that provision of the compact is severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.164" offset="12748887">It is not necessary for the joint audit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.045" offset="12764352">Many of the subpoenas and court proceedings that the appellants have referred to in their brief, as of uses by the commission, were really subpoenas by the individual State Courts asking their courts to enforce that subpoena that requested that the multistate taxpayer turn their books and records over to the commission as an agent for audit purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.120" offset="12876678">It was state subpoenas that were used, that were complained of in the appellant’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.802" offset="12903428">This is why we asserted there that such allegations did not involve any authority or power of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.774" offset="12939268">But, we believe even though the subpoena power is severable, not necessary to the validity or working of the join audit program that itself has no constitutional defect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.254" offset="13005201">The other substantive provision in the compact is Article 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.116" offset="13024636">It permits the tax administrators of the member states to issue advisory regulations and form where state laws are uniform or similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.194" offset="13117005">This is purely an advisory function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.740" offset="13127140">The only regulations that this commission has promulgated at all concern Article 4 of the compact which is the optional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.808" offset="13167369">It contains the language of the Uniform Division of the Income for Tax Purposes Act promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.321" offset="13217420">This ability to issue advisory regulations that are optional with the state is no different than the ability of any person or entity whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.717" offset="13279069">It is done with the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.404" offset="13293802">It has been done for years by the National Association of Tax Administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.144" offset="13312714">It could be done by the American Bar Association, any other group, or individual whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.006" offset="13332254">It is purely advisory to have no force or effect until they are adapted by the state and, surprisingly, the only regulation that the appellants are complaining about here has to do with an optional provision under the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.876" offset="13403725">Therefore, before the regulations under Article 4 adapted by the commission can be applicable to appellants two things must happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.259" offset="13441237">One, they have to elect through apportion or allocate their income under Article 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.599" offset="13462553">Secondly, a state has to adapt those regulations as their own regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.980" offset="13488048">When they do, it becomes their regulation and not the advisory regulations of the commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3660.207" offset="14721028">They want no part of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.190" offset="14732940">I would like to indicate the admission of the appellants in regard to the effect of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.589" offset="14758540">They say, on page 12 of their brief, the potential impact of such a compact is not readily determinable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.315" offset="14789469">We suggest that it does not have any potential impact on federal supremacy and that is the reason it is not determinable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.678" offset="14866895">All we are suggesting to this court is examine the case law concerning the compact clause , look at the specific provisions of the compact clause in the light of the appellant’s argument and we are confident you will come out with the same conclusions that the Three-Judge Court did in its well recent opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.298" offset="14957384">We do not believe it is adequate for the appellant simply to throw judicial history out of the window, call it dicta, limit it to boundary disputes and hopefully, in that way, have this court come up with some different and new standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.746" offset="15027183">The constitution means the same thing regardless of the subject matter involved, whether it involves boundary disputes, reciprocal legislation, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.048" offset="15080368">We believe the reasoning of Justice Felix Frankfurter in the case of New York versus O’Neill is instructive and helpful in resolving this question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="3854.744" offset="15499163">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.737" offset="15507104">I would like to deal with Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.101" offset="15528629">It is an instance of how this commission pays no attention to the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.192" offset="15552975">The compact provided expressly that each state shall have one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.082" offset="15572515">California came in on condition that nothing should be passed unless there was vote of a majority of the population of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.686" offset="15618909">That gave California almost a veto, not quite, but California and two or three other states can veto and the legislative history is clear that that is the reason why Indiana withdrew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.207" offset="15677005">The annual reports of the commission make it plain that the genesis of the compact was to head off federal legislation with respect to taxation of interstate businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.098" offset="15724548">In other words, in its very origin, its purpose was to interfere with the exercise of federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.027" offset="15760283">Reference has been made to UDITPA, the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.152" offset="15792780">UDITPA provides for allocation of non-business income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.802" offset="15819424">But, the commission by its regulations provides that virtually all non-business income shall be apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.999" offset="15868221">Here again as several commentators cited in our brief have shown the commission paid simply no attention to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.335" offset="15901553">You can say “it only has recommend their mandatory power” but it recommends to the states that they proceed this way and they do proceed that way as is evidenced by an item in the record where the commission recommended to a number of state that they make arbitrary assessments against corporations which did not comply with the actions of the state commissioners and that this would be a means of bringing about their capitulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.272" offset="16049302">I would like to refer particularly to an opinion by Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach in a letter by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.797" offset="16079395">In our brief, we have mistakenly said the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.793" offset="16095382">He was later Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.566" offset="16102487">But, when he wrote the letter he was Deputy Attorney General dealing with the Great Lake’s compact in which he pointed out that merely because it was advisory did not mean that it could have impact on the powers of the federal government.</text>
