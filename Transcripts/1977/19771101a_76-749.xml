            <text syncTime="58.614" offset="314348">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.420" offset="329603">These cases present the question of whether foreign governments may sue for treble-damages under our antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.511" offset="365966">Or precisely the question is, did Congress intend to include the sovereign governments of foreign nations among those 'persons' for whom it created a treble-damage remedy in the Sherman Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="88.885" offset="435451">There are three cases here which were consolidated for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.236" offset="456872">They are part of the so-called antibiotic antitrust litigation which at one time consisted of upwards of 160 damaged cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.044" offset="500130">The plaintiff's respondents here are the Imperial Government of Iran, the Government of India, the Republic of the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.510" offset="537956">The principal allegations and their complaints are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.777" offset="551017">Each of them alleges the defendant's fixed prices and otherwise suppress competition in the manufacture and sale of certain antibiotic drugs in the United States and abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.401" offset="605561">Each of them alleges that it purchased antibiotics which were exported from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.030" offset="636072">Each of them alleges that it sues on behalf of various classes, one of which is described as all individual consumers within their respective country.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.911" offset="679539">And finally, each of them alleges that it is an independent sovereign nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.562" offset="706184">The issue was raised in the District Court on motions addressed to the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.556" offset="730113">The District Court decided that foreign nations may maintain treble-damages resting its decision primarily on the Judge's perception that, that was necessary as he put it to the effective enforcement of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.699" offset="798762">His decision was certified for immediate appeal on a panel of the Eight Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.016" offset="831990">The panel did not rest its decision on the same ground that District Court had but instead relied principally on this Court's decision in Georgia against Evans holding that states are persons for treble-damage purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.057" offset="892176">One member the panel filed a concurring opinion in which he observed that in his view Congress had no intent on this question whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.320" offset="937211">He thought the result was dictated by this Court's Georgia against Evans decision but he recommended that Congress should examine the question and clarify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.242" offset="980888">There was a rehearing en banc after which six of the eight active Judges of the Eighth Circuit adopted the panel's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.993" offset="1019863">Three of those six also adopting the concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.030" offset="1040029">There were two dissents, the dissenters relied on the Court's decision the United States against Cooper in which it was held that the United States is not a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.307" offset="1085169">And the dissenters observed that in their opinion it would be anomalous to hold that the United States could not sue for treble-damages but a foreign sovereign could.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.181" offset="1136682">I think it is fair to say that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals made an independent examination of the legislative history and instead they looked entirely to this Court's two decisions which I have mentioned for guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.187" offset="1212646">Now, if the Court please, we have a straight-forward question of congressional intent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.612" offset="1238351">There is no issue in this case about whether a foreign nation may sue in United States Courts if it has a proper client.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.538" offset="1270116">Of course it can, the question is, did these foreign nations have the claim they pleaded?</text>
            <text syncTime="304.487" offset="1297910">And that in turn depends upon whether Congress gave it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.137" offset="1324450">Our argument begins with the language of the statute which confers the treble-damage remedy on any person who shall be injured by reason of a violation and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.918" offset="1383592">It is our contention that language just read in its ordinary and natural sense would not be taken to include sovereign governments and we have cited in our brief three decisions by this Court in which the Court made a similar observation, the Fox case in 1876, the Cooper case itself and United Mine Workers in 330 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.825" offset="1499262">Now, if the Court please we believe that there is evidence here developed at some length in our briefs that Congress in 1890 had a pretty clear understanding of the term 'person' and a pretty clear understanding of what that meant and did not mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.218" offset="1588810">One point that we rely on as such evidence is the statute of 1871 in which a Congress says, this Court's prior opinions have set -- created it's own dictionary and an amendment in that statute, when the revised statutes of 1874 were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.083" offset="1676268">The 1871 statute had defined a person by saying that it may extend and be applied to Bodies Politic and corporations unless the context indicates a more limited meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.296" offset="1745126">When the revisers of the statutes submitted their report to Congress they suggested that the phrase Bodies Politic be deleted on the ground that it introduced an unnecessary ambiguity and that, with that ambiguity it might be thought in future statutes necessary expressly to exclude governmental entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.925" offset="1855677">For that purpose the phrase was deleted from the definitional statute when it was reenacted in 1874 so that it read then, and at the time of the Sherman Act and now that the word 'person' may extend and be applied to corporations and associations unless the context indicates a more limited meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.782" offset="1963092">We have cited in our brief evidence that senators who were the principal draftsmen of the Sherman Act were familiar with that little bit of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.484" offset="2005828">Specifically senators Edmunds and Hore.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.719" offset="2026831">And when those senators wrote their definition in the Sherman Act they nailed down the fact that person must include corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.190" offset="2080643">That is to say the 1874 statute made it allowable, person may extend, but in Section 8 of the Sherman Act that is written, person shall be deemed to include corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.475" offset="2149815">Now when Senator Edmunds introduced the Sherman Act on the floor of the Senate, he said that the legislation is clear in its terms and definite in its definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.624" offset="2210419">The definition of person is the only one in the Sherman Act, and we submit that it is a matter of logical construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.662" offset="2258589">If the Congress in the light of the change and the definitional statute thought it necessary expressly to include corporations which might have been included as a matter of discretion in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.922" offset="2331628">It must follow that they had no intention whatever to include sovereign Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.437" offset="2397665">The terms of the problem we are discussing we submit that first Georgia was not really a Sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.206" offset="2432774">Georgia was not able to exercise sovereignty over the problem it was faced with.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="596.823" offset="2467255">But was it a corporation or a person as defined in Section 8 of the Sherman Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="601.170" offset="2484601">No, my argument Justice Stevens is not that the definitional statutes are conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.748" offset="2518873">Our argument is that they are very Weighty evidence of what Congress intended and that should take a fairly clear expression of congressional purpose to read a government into that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.185" offset="2576656">Now in the Georgia case I think there is evidence that the Supreme Court intended to include Georgia and the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.123" offset="2616467">One of the problems that Congress was dealing with in the Sherman Act was the inability of states to reach combinations and trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.401" offset="2657531">Senator Sherman used as an example to illustrate the need for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.609" offset="2682400">The inability of the State of New York to reach the Sugar trust because if members were beyond then territorial jurisdiction of the State of New York so that Congress had very much in mind and we both submit -- intended to create a remedy for limited state jurisdiction which was involved in the Georgia case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="684.789" offset="2819073">Do you see any constitutional objection counsel to having the united states if it elected to enter into conventions or treaties with certain countries granting them the rights the Eighth Circuit has given here, granting it by treaty or convention either on a reciprocal basis or for any reason the Executive Branch and the Congress agreed on?</text>

            <text syncTime="715.182" offset="2940699">No Sir, I do not believe I do, and I do not see any reason why Congress had it thought it desirable to do so, or if it should think it is desirable to do so now, could not legislate that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.422" offset="2997646">In other words, if other countries did not grant the same right to the United States then we could deny it to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.554" offset="3026171">Yes Sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.406" offset="3033590">It seems to me that one of the very strong points in our position, in just an ordinary practical sort of way is it simply is improbable that a Congress which intended to exclude the United States from the treble-damage remedy as the Cooper case decided that did, could have intended to give that remedy to a foreign sovereign because the interest of the United States government are closely associated, perhaps indistinguishable from those of the American public for whose protection the antitrust laws were passed whereas the interests of foreign sovereigns may and frequently are divergent and on occasion opposed to those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.074" offset="3244241">And following along on that line of thought it seems to me more than just improbable but highly-unlikely that a Congress with that sort of intention might have intended to recruit foreign sovereigns to assist in the enforcement of our antitrust laws which was the basis for the District Court's decision and as I read it is essentially the argument which the Department of Justice has made in it's amici's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.432" offset="3421665">Exactly Sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.652" offset="3430547">The speeches of Congressmen who were prominent in this legislation at that time which we have cited in our briefs, I think to make it very clear that what they were interested in doing was protecting domestic consumers, protecting the domestic market and they had no interest whatever in protecting foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.056" offset="3552173">In short if the Court please, it appears to us that there is ample evidence in the legislative history of a congressional intent not to make the treble-damage remedy available to foreign nations, whereas it seems to us there is evidence in the legislative history of an intent to make it available to State governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.592" offset="3662305">Now the decision of the Eighth Circuit at least we suggest brings about a peculiar result.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.219" offset="3696787">Peculiar in the sense that it gives, for example, the imperial government of Iran a right to sue for treble-damages when the United States government now can sue only for actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.723" offset="3750808">And we submit that an intent to bring about that result or not being imputed to Congress without some very clear and strong evidence, but that is what it intended to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.928" offset="6083647">That appears on page 24-61 and again on 24-63 of 21 Congressional Record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.160" offset="6120532">Senator Sherman was (Inaudible) to distinguish between the first section of his bill which allowed the United States alternate remedies, criminal remedies, injunctive remedies, seizure remedies, and he said that these remedies were made available for the US.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.801" offset="6199108">It turned upon the perceived obligations of the sovereign to enforce its own laws without reference to the added stimulus of the damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.106" offset="6232336">Then, having distinguished the remedy made available solely to the US, he said that the damage remedy was to be made available to all other parties as he put it, so that the Cooper result is a direct reflection of the intent of the sponsors as a bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.648" offset="6310495">All other parties were to have the benefit of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.383" offset="6329407">Moreover the treble-damage remedy has been extended to persons, to states, to foreign corporations, and since this Court has said in Dunhill nation enters this country in a commercial capacity, it is to be treated the same as every other traitor subject to the same structures of the marketplace; subject to the same penalties of the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.119" offset="6432434">It would be very unfair then to deny in any remedy when there are multi-district Courts set in Georgia by a violator of the antitrust laws.</text>
