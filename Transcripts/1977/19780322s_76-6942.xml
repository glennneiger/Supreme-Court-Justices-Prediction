            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="7.717" offset="110808">This case is here on a writ of certiorari granted to the Supreme Court of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.035" offset="144036">The petitioner Ensio Ruben Lakeside was brought to trial in an Oregon court on a criminal charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.812" offset="179145">Four witnesses testified from the defense s but the petitioner himself did not take the witness stand on his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.691" offset="214671">Over the objection of his counsel, the trial judge instructed the Jury that the defendant has an option whether or not to testify and that no adverse inferences of any kind were to be drawn from the petitioners failure to take the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.912" offset="279560">The question presented in this case is whether the giving of such a cautionary instruction over the objection of Defense Council violates the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.696" offset="322714">The Oregon Court of Appeals believing that a trial judge should not give this cautionary instruction when Defense Council objects, reversed the petitioner's conviction and ordered a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.586" offset="370257">But the Oregon Supreme Court reinstated the conviction holding that the giving of instruction over the objection of counsel did not violate the constitutional rights of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.338" offset="417277">Because of conflicting decisions in several other courts, we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.781" offset="443086">It is an established rule in Oregon as it is in the Federal Judicial system that the kind of instruction given in this case must be given if the defendant requests it.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.487" offset="489897">The petitioner does not question this rule, and orders the assert that the language of the instruction  actually given was in any respect an erroneous statement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.148" offset="532529">His  argument is quite simply that this protective instruction becomes constitutionally impermissible when given over the defendant's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.724" offset="574848">For the reasons set out in some detail in the written opinion of the court, we hold that the giving of this cautionary instruction over the defendant's objection does not violate either the constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination or the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.827" offset="651230">Accordingly the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oregon is affirmed, Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in most of which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.008" offset="699922">Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
