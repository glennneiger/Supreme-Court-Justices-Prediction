            <label>Mr. Oscar Chase</label>
            <text syncTime="49.432" offset="277705">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.248" offset="292960">I am Oscar Chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.008" offset="295990">I represent the plaintiffs in this action who consist essentially of two groups of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.265" offset="321068">One group was employed by the City of New York at the times of the events alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.238" offset="344892">The other group was employed by the Board of Education of the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.786" offset="363073">The two groups have in common the fact that they will all compel to take unwanted leaves of absence from their employment as a result of a compulsory pregnancy rule of the kind with which the court is familiar after Cleveland Board of Education against LaFleur.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.579" offset="434230">The principle relief sought was injunctive and declaratory relief as well as an award of lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.627" offset="466518">After the defendants changed their policies, some time after the complaint was filed, the court below dismissed the declaratory and injunctive request as moot and then went on to dismiss the remaining claims for back pay as a wanting and subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.667" offset="542586">The court held and the Court of Appeals affirmed that the Board of Education was not a "Person" within the meaning of Section 1983 and then in the second branch of the case, held that municipal officials are not persons when monitory relief is sought against them in their official capacity.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="136.993" offset="627954">Do you say monitory relief is sought against them in their official capacity, you mean monitory relief to come out of the public treasury in some form?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_chase" startTime="146.306" stopTime="160.184">
            <label>Mr. Oscar Chase</label>
            <text syncTime="146.306" offset="665153">That would be the effect of it, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.566" offset="678214">Turning first to the question of whether or not the Board of Education is a person, we must note preliminarily that the question is a unitary one in terms of remedial purposes.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="160.184" stopTime="174.244">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="160.184" offset="720741">Okay, just before you go on, in connection with Brother Rehnquist's question, there is no finding here and no issue as to whether the individual members are persons or purposes of prospective relief?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_chase" startTime="174.244" stopTime="281.637">
            <label>Mr. Oscar Chase</label>
            <text syncTime="174.244" offset="776957">That was not raised below because that aspect of the case was moot and no appeal was taken from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.517" offset="809976">But as to the unitary question of the personhood of the Board of Education, City of Kenosha against Bruno teaches that the personhood is not determinable by reference to the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.815" offset="863266">Under 1983, a person is a person and as to the board's status in that regard, we would note that the court is not here writing on a clean slate, there is a long line of precedent dealing with school segregation cases, a line of cases lamented by some I suppose, applauded by most, but agreed by all to a workday fundamental change in the way this country educates its young.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.306" offset="973189">The Court of Appeals rejected the importance of those cases on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.205" offset="992728">One, the results reached as to jurisdiction in those cases were reached through inadvertence and secondly, the individuals, members of the board were named in those cases as well as the board members.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.158" offset="1056572">These reasons we submit are insufficient for rejecting this established line.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.869" offset="1079455">First is to the fact that they were as we can see it in most of these cases individual defendants as well as board members.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.461" offset="1113832">We would note though that the court has focused time and again on the board, the defendant board, the respondent board and Mr. Justice Powell concurring in the second Milliken case last term, noted that in the line of precedents commencing with Brown, the principal defendant, I am quoting here is usually the local Board of Education or School Board.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="281.637" offset="1206514">What would be the distinguisher between the local board and the state board?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_chase" startTime="287.544" stopTime="300.403">
            <label>Mr. Oscar Chase</label>
            <text syncTime="287.544" offset="1230129">Yes and for the purposes of that case it was relevant, but for the purpose of this case, I think the important thing is that whether it be state board or local board, it is the board that is the defendant, it is the entity that is doing the wrong.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="300.403" stopTime="326.734">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="300.403" offset="1281538">Well, but counsel, now do not you have to take things in context when you are talking about a substantive right to relief, you may not be focusing on who are proper defendants and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.641" offset="1342560">I do not think you can take every word as written out of every opinion of this court and say that it decides a question that the court may not have been focusing on.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.803" offset="1375161">I thought from your earlier comment, you probably agreed with that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_chase" startTime="326.734" stopTime="430.781">
            <label>Mr. Oscar Chase</label>
            <text syncTime="326.734" offset="1386864">Oh, I do agree with it Your Honor and if we were talking about one or two cases or an accidental reference in an occasional case to a school board, I would not be presenting this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.343" offset="1429287">But we are dealing here with a line of cases which as I mentioned is fundamental in the jurisprudence and in the political history of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.167" offset="1472650">Its strange belief that this court which has imposed on itself in another context, the duty of determining whether subject matter jurisdiction exists in the lower courts, that this court would then fail to appreciate that problem in cases of this magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.042" offset="1540150">Of course it is always open to the court to readdress a fundamental point of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.884" offset="1571497">But we would add that Congress has additionally acted in reliance on those cases and has also spoken in terms of local educational agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.169" offset="1624683">Thus Congress and we cite the statute in our brief and the amicus brief has allowed attorney's fees to be provided to prevailing parties where the defendant was a local educational agency and the leading case interpreting that statute, the Bradley case was a 1983 case in which the defendant was a school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.732" offset="1714857">There is also the statute providing financial assistance to "Local educational agencies", bearing the financial burden of a school disaggregation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.809" offset="1759161">So, that where there is the established line and there is congressional reliance, they would appear to be really a rule that we have arrived at which remains only to be announced.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="430.781" stopTime="459.209">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="430.781" offset="1803047">Well, where a local financially or where a local board bears the burden of a school desegregation order and gets a grant from the government, the order could be perfectly effective, prospectively through individual school board members and nonetheless impose the burden of buying buses and that sort of thing on the school district I would suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.878" offset="1887474">Is not it that language of Congress there perfectly reconcilable with that interpretation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_chase" startTime="459.209" stopTime="581.278">
            <label>Mr. Oscar Chase</label>
            <text syncTime="459.209" offset="1916836">It is reconcilable, yes but it is also reconcilable and I think more so given the language that Congress chose to use, they focused on the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.565" offset="1958214">It is reconcilable, I think more happily with the point that appellants present here, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.844" offset="1991337">Of course, defendants would have this court turn its back on that twenty years of decision of law and defendant argues principally that the logic of Monroe against Pape requires a similar holding for these persons, these boards of education which it says "fulfill an important governmental role".</text>
            <text syncTime="501.125" offset="2084438">Let us see how this would frustrate the statute, both its purposes and its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.048" offset="2108157">1983 is a statute which applies only where there is color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.986" offset="2135951">It will almost always be the case, if not always, that a corporation or person acting on the color of law is fulfilling an important governmental role.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.124" offset="2176493">So that under defendant's view, when the statute applies when you get into it, you are also shunted out of it because you are really by definition fulfilling that important role.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.477" offset="2229888">Such a reading would, aside from being absurd, and I submit imputing to Congress an intent to pass a meaningless statute in that context, such a reading would allow states if they were such in mind to evade constitutional obligations by setting up corporations to undertake important governmental roles and one thinks of Smith against Allwright where in another context the court said to the Democratic Party of Texas back in those days, "You can not set up a Jaybird society and tell us that is not the State of Texas operating the primers."</text>
            <text syncTime="574.822" offset="2379203">I think the case is relevant its spirit if not in precise holding.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.074" offset="2448271">Well Your Honor, I think that that is an important ingredient of our case because under the Monroe holding, a city is simply not a person and we do not think our case presents the court with the necessity of reconsidering that holding.</text>

Healthy against Doyle where the question there was whether a school board was an arm of the state and the mere fact that it got funds from the state , did not make it an arm of the state anymore than the fact that the Board of Education gets funds from the city, makes it "An arm of the city"</text>

            <text syncTime="746.481" offset="3065910">No, the constitution provides that education is a power that the control of education is a power reserved to the state and excludes it interestingly on the constitutional point, it is reserved, it is excluded from the Home Rule Provisions of the New York constitution which do define the sphere of influence of cities and is a further indicia of the fact that it is not an arm of the city, but it is in primarily in statutory law Your Honor that the board is established as a separate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.375" offset="3189417">It is in the New York education of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.077" offset="3208226">Now, Your Honors I had addressed, the point as to how the defendant's position would frustrate the language of the statute and let's take a look now at the purposes of the statute and how this argument fits in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.373" offset="3269457">The purpose of Section 1983 is revealed in the title by which it is referred to in the statutes at large and in the debate, an act to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment and I may say parenthetically that in Monroe the court referred to it as the Ku Klux act which I think frankly, well somewhat accurate is a misnomer, the true purpose, the true title was an act to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment and it has been agreed that that purpose was its primary purpose, even Justice Frankfurter, in his decent in Monroe, said that the purpose of Section 1 of this Act of 1871 was to protect against constitutional violations through the authority enhanced by the majesty and dignity of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.139" offset="3472480">Just as here we have this corporation setup by the board, given some powers by the state and then in this case has violated people's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.048" offset="3508111">It is the very situation in which the statute Section 1 was intended to apply and when the legislature, when Congress used the word all persons are liable, it clearly intended to include such corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.594" offset="3574358">We know this because first the common understanding of the term corporation, or persons in a legal sense included corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.731" offset="3614900">This court said as much as early as 1838, it was just an axiom unless someone tells this otherwise the term persons in a statute means corporations and beyond that we have the Dictionary Act adopted by the same Congress of 1871 which said in it that you may take it that we mean corporations as well as corporeal persons when we use the term persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.258" offset="3732973">Now, counsel is quite aware that the Dictionary Act was rejected as precedent as binding in the Monroe case because in Monroe the court found a special intent to treat municipalities differently from other persons and we submit that no such finding can be made with regard to this kind of corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.372" offset="3849479">And let me explain why this is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.207" offset="3860764">First, the Sherman amendment in terms would have imposed liability on cities for acts of violence done within their borders in terms -- on the county, city or parish "In which the riotous acts occurred".</text>
            <text syncTime="962.440" offset="3929728">There was no discussion of corporations such as the Board of Education which exist for particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.647" offset="3958567">Any such discussion would have been absurd, no one would have thought to impose liability on a Board of Education if they had thought of it because riotous acts occurred in the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.474" offset="4005901">But I think even more important, Boards of Education were creatures that were only barely gaining their own under American law at the time of these debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.975" offset="4051876">Certainly, they were never mentioned during the debates, there is no indication that they were before the Congress, we just do not know what Congress would have thought about its powers to impose liabilities on these creatures of law even if we do know what Congress thought about its power vis-a-vis municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.976" offset="4139857">So that a holding which would extend the legislative history reading in Monroe yet further to include these entities would really rest if I may say so, on the legislative history of imagination, of surmise rather than the legislative history of scholarship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.290" offset="4233166">An additional point on the relevance of the Sherman Amendment is that we must recall that the Sherman Amendment was an additional section to the Act of 1871, it would have been tacked on the end.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.686" offset="4374750">Your Honor, at this point I would like to turn with the court's permission to the second aspect of our position that the defendants can be required under Section 1983 that is the official defendants can be required to use their official powers to make whole the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.477" offset="4449878">That is they can be required in the words of this Court in Griffin v. Prince Edward County to use the powers that is theirs, to remedy the wrongs that they have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.231" offset="4488852">Now, let me begin by saying that here unlike plaintiff's claim against the school board, it is undeniable that an order to the defendant Mayor in his official capacity will have some impact on the municipality and thus the limit in Monroe is at least arguably relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.813" offset="4559174">But we contend it is not determinative, because it is beyond dispute that the defendants are in their official capacity subject to 1983, for injunctive and other purposes and that was held in Kenosha that the quality of personhood does not depend on the type of relief sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.587" offset="4834296">That is in general, municipal law, Section 70 of the New York Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.603" offset="4858328">So that I do not think, I think that the situation would there be as in any case in which the defendant turns out to be judgment proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.778" offset="4883092">The plaintiff gets a judgment, but he can not enforce it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.946" offset="5351729">I was about to say that a logically consistent system of 1983 jurisprudence would require, taking into account the Kenosha case and the other cases that we cite in our brief in which the court has affirmed lower court holdings ordering defendants in their official capacity to make restitution to plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.001" offset="5447964">That those cases require a similar holding here and I think it is fair to say that this is an issue that can not be decided in either direction without some infringement on Starry Decisis Principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.234" offset="5500941">The court is caught between conflicting lines of cases and I suggest that that plaintiff's position is the best way to resolve them because it looks back to the fundamental purpose of Section 1983, the purpose of protecting constitutional rights and enforcing of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.376" offset="5589443">Anything which would be found in the legislative history that might be contrary wise, all was in the context of the Sherman Amendment which was really not terribly relevant to Section 1 at all and in so far as the Monroe case does stand against the position that plaintiffs take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.508" offset="5689963">We would make at least three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.929" offset="5699680">In Monroe, the city was the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.676" offset="5714622">So, that just in the narrow Starry Decisis, the case is inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.882" offset="5739491">Second and more broadly, plaintiffs do not here seek to render Monroe meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.253" offset="5764986">We are not saying that the plaintiffs in Monroe could have sued the Mayor Daley of Chicago and obtained a judgment because some police officer beat them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.323" offset="5805215">Mayor Daley in that case did not wrongfully exercise his official powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.643" offset="5826531">The analogy is very close to Rizzo against Goode where then police commissioner Rizzo could not be held liable the court thought because some of his officers had run a muck allegedly, nor could under our view the plaintiff in Monroe sue the police officer in his official capacity, because the police officer in that capacity has no authority to dispense public funds to make whole injured plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.691" offset="6594740">I think the power is there in the District Court because if the power is not there, using the defendant's approach, a defendant official would be subject to Section 1983 because he has official powers and then when the court seeks to order him to exercise those official powers, it would be the very same powers that he would use to say, oh no you can not do that to me because that would be the same as having an impact on the entity that I serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.829" offset="6759311">Now, the lower court was impressed by this Eleventh Amendment analogy that it found and I would like to address myself to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.802" offset="6795151">The Eleventh Amendment of course is a prohibition, it says that there shall be no suits by a citizen against a state and I have a great difficult in analogizing that provision which is wholly negative to a provision which had it as its prime purpose and expansive of view of federal power to protect constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.756" offset="6890968">Secondly, I find it difficult to believe that the Congress did enacted Section 1983, had in its mind this Eleventh Amendment construct, when the Ex parte Young was not even decided until about 1908 and this is a Congress that could never -- I don't think it contemplated the unusual chain of events that led to Ex parte Young which has resolved those competing considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.569" offset="7010191">If there is an intent to insulate municipalities, it can be found in only one place and that is in the rejection of the so called Sherman Amendment that would have made cities vicariously liable for acts that it did not commit that were committed within its borders and in Monroe of course, the court read the rejection of the Sherman Amendment to mean that Congress had decided, it had no power to impose "Liability" on cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.206" offset="7140803">But of course, that is different than saying that the Congress thought that it had to insulate the cities from even and the ancillary effect of orders against those whom it -- or concede did have power to affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.186" offset="7212692">Secondly, we think that the court in Monroe read the legislative history rather too broadly, in the very language, the Mr. Justice Douglas quoted in Monroe, he quoted Representative Poland who was a Reconstruction Republican, believed four-square in the Fourteenth amendment, but said in his one speech that Mr. Justice Douglas quoted that we do not have the power to impose and "Obligations on municipalities" and we think that the correct reading of that legislative history was something like this, even the reconstruction republicans recognize that in 1871 there was no power to say to a city, you shall have a police force on the part of the Congress, you shall have the police force, you shall police what goes on in the neighborhoods and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.670" offset="7410596">The states decided what the obligations of the cities were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.027" offset="7424075">That being the case, they said, "How can we in good faith or even constitutionally" tell them, you are liable for not doing that which we do not have the power to tell you to do in the first place?</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.568" offset="7474230">And I do not have the time to read from the record, and from the brief, but I think that Your Honors will find that the key republicans who were in support of this basic approach of Section 1983 did have difficulty, but only on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.687" offset="7546746">They believe they had the power to impose a liability, but not obligations on municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.829" offset="7587288">So, we find that the Eleventh Amendment analogy is simply not supported by reference to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.666" offset="7614665">Congressmen like Congressman Curt who was against everything they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.232" offset="7628875">He was a democrat who thought the Fourteenth Amendment did not give the powers that the republicans thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.318" offset="7649251">I do not think the court should look to his quotes and use them to interpret a law that he was against right from A to Z. So, we think that the legislative history does not support this special intent to protect municipalities and I will if Your Honor, please reserve the rest of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.044" offset="7808180">The New York Law indicates that this is a hybrid entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.179" offset="7828660">The state constitution provides that every child shall be guaranteed a free public education, this provision of state constitution, the State Board of Regions and the Commissioner of Education.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.675" offset="7910684">Boards of Education are arms of the state coming perilously close to an Eleventh amendment defense being available, we can urge that in light of this court's and a healthy decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.189" offset="7960735">Other cases indicate that based up on its slotted city funding, its relationship under the city charter with the city, and of the e education law, with respect to appointment of members of the Board of Education, that is as a city agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.204" offset="8020817">I do not think that is dispositive determinations case Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.568" offset="8074211">This court in National League of Cities v. Usery treated Boards of Educations and public hospital systems as just as clearly governmental entities as what we generally think of as municipal corporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.500" offset="8197927">I think McQuillin, on municipal corporations would probably discuss it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.922" offset="8215690">There are a host of arrangements whereby local Boards of Education are established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.422" offset="8245679">Right now the Mayor of the City of New York would like to have a clearly city agency with him appointing a local chancellor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.020" offset="12804046">It may have been a reference to the earlier reconstruction acts making it violation, criminal violation, so now you have in addition have a civil remedy for this type of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.027" offset="12864023">Your Honors --he same need for a fiction and this court has itself characterized Ex parte Young as devising a fictional remedy, the same need for a fiction is called for here and why I will be blunt, when it comes to damages and damage actions 1983 is about as blunderbuss an instrument as there exist, it is not tailored to the situation, it is not like Title 7, where you have procedures to go through and limits, discretion of the court with respect to back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.909" offset="13019608">Here you establish liability and they say ipso facto we get the judgment, you show the liability and the damages and that is it case is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.805" offset="13067151">A line of cases involving officials and whatever immunity they enjoy for their official action, this court has placed a gloss in 1983 by reference to common law immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.315" offset="13149176">I am not asking for a common law immunity to be found somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.111" offset="13172372">I think my job is easy Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.385" offset="13181463">I am saying here we know what the intent of the Congress was, no such judgments allowed against municipalities or local sub divisions of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.384" offset="13221483">We do not have to look to Harper &amp; James on the Law of Torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.607" offset="13258368">Your honors, if the plaintiff's, petitioners here prevail in this case they will have opened up a major area for litigation which will be ruinously expensive for Municipalities Boards of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.085" offset="13352304">There is no action taken by government officials today that probably 10-15 years later will not be subject to constitutional litigation and we may lose the best, the good faith under this theory is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.621" offset="13430462">Now on these circumstances, Your Honor if these plaintiffs and the Class Action, certified class action I do not know how many were involved in this case, could conceivably be tens of millions where they are not without remedies they can seek a the preliminary injunction, district court and go to state court to get relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.472" offset="13521891">There is a balance that must be struck, I think it is fairly obvious balance without being slavish the intent of an 1871 Congress, the court can consider as it has an earlier case as what that Congress intended and give effect to it, not just because of the strictures about statutory construction in judicial legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.235" offset="13620947">That does not always decide cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.277" offset="13637039">I would suggest that when you study and consider balance, considerations the equity is here, it just does not make sense to allow a blunderbuss instruments such as this to be made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.128" offset="13720421">We are not talking about equitable restitution, we are really talking about damages and we are talking damages paid to classes of people, god knows how large the classes will be, what the amounts in question will be and if the deeper pocket theory of tort recovery has to operate, real politics of tort analysis but I would also add, the pocket is not deep, its broad, its not deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.434" offset="13857721">It is not irrelevant that the cities are in trouble, they are having trouble providing essential services, it is s not irrelevant that the cities can not practically go into bankruptcy, but that that they are not judgment proof that is not irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.245" offset="13928983">I am saying please think seriously about imposing additional large, substantial burdens on governmental entities that are already strapped over burdened finding it difficult to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.704" offset="13994812">We laid off 5000 policeman in New York City, 11,000 teachers, we laid off lawyers, we laid off legal secretaries, law secretaries to judges, other cities are in the same boat, small municipalities, small school systems, they could be literally bankrupted.</text>
