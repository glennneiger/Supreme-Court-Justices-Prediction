            <label>Mr. Frierson M. Graves, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="49.443" offset="277687">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, my name is Frierson Graves and I represent the Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division which is a part of the City of Memphis, a municipal utility which has both electric, gas and water operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.104" offset="344351">This action arose when Mr. and Mrs. Craft and several others sued the Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division alleging that their utility services were being terminated without due process of law and they ask for both injunctive and declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.557" offset="422196">The District Court implied that there was property in the utility services.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.210" offset="444766">It really did not say one way or another, but the implication is there, but found that minimum due process was present in the procedure used by the Light, Gas &amp; Water, but it suggested a change in the notice that we were given, giving to our customers when the final notice was sent out which was an additional stuff or a flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.172" offset="540583">This change was made in the notice, a final order entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.667" offset="558660">It was an appeal to the Sixth Circuit which found that utility services was property.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.645" offset="586559">However, this finding as to due process had two different holdings, as to Mr. and Mrs. Parks who had an admitted liability for an amount of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.043" offset="648103">The Sixth Circuit said that our final notice with Act applying to credit counselors and a hearing before credit counselors to arrange budget payments or extended payments was a efficient constitutional due process notice and hearing, but on the other hand, the Crafts who allegedly had a dispute that a notice and a hearing was not sufficient and we did not have a established procedures for a hearing nor did I notice used the word dispute really in it and applying to the Crafts.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.295" offset="797105">We petitioned this Court and the two questions were whether or not utility services are property and secondly whether or not the procedures used by the Light, Gas &amp; Water meet the minimum requirements of the due process or what procedures must be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.544" offset="874114">I would like to say first that a utility wants to keep its customers on land.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.290" offset="897102">It wants to generate the revenue whether it is a municipal utility or a private utility because we in Memphis operate on a non-profit basis as a municipal utility just to pay expenses so the more revenue we are able to generate from the customer, they end up better to spread that for your administrative expenses among your ratepayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.593" offset="982261">Secondly, we think and we think our procedures establishes this that a utility ought to do all it can to help its customer pay its bills and one of things that we did which is in the record of this Court is to establish a budget procedure or a policy of having extended payments.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="246.108" offset="1064390">I suppose a fair quarreler of what you have just suggested is that the paying customer should not be required to subsidize the non-paying customers?</text>

            <text syncTime="256.732" offset="1106918">Your Honor I think that goes back to sort of the general common law rules about a utility that you should not give free service because just as you must provide service to a customer, if a reasonable service to him so that every person can have the service, likewise you should not give the service to a customer who is not paying for that because you are discriminating against your ratepayer in that way and of course they say that reason both is for reasonable room for free service plus the fact that you are avoiding numerous small petty suits because utility services is merely a credit transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.761" offset="1279012">Normally, you have an individual either in oral contract, in Memphis you can have your utilities connected by calling up on the telephone and say will you connect the utilities to my address?</text>
            <text syncTime="311.442" offset="1325719">The utilities are connected, you are asked to pay a deposit of $25 in this, that sometimes place the point in your first bill, in this you have a small credit transaction therefore which, we extend the new customer 65 days of service almost or that possibility 60 or 65 days before we can cut the personnel.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.828" offset="1531251">We established a notice and a procedure and the Sixth Circuit said that they did not comment on our new notice, but our old notice was still constitutionally deficient, so that is their declaratory judgment and relief that our notice was sufficient in this and of course we are contending that utility service really is not property.</text>

Congress this past year have appropriated 200 million dollars for the Community Development Act to help pay on utility bills for this past winter, but that is if they want energy stamps or other matters in which to pay for utility services, it should be taxpayer program and not a ratepayer program that it is upon the utility to maintain this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.427" offset="6689599">They did it, they did not pay their bill again, when they were cut off in November, even though they were getting two bills for not double billing, split billing, each meter registering the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.567" offset="6738186">When they came back in November, their utilities were cut back on and they were put on budget billing and they paid $25 or so and $100 were delayed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.876" offset="7179447">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.948" offset="7195747">This case arouse as a result of a dispute that developed Memphis, Tennessee between Mr. and Mrs. Willie. S Craft and the Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.475" offset="7233886">Without going into the details of that dispute, I think its fair to say that the dispute existed over a period of several months prior to the filing of this suit, during which time the Crafts' utility services were terminated on several occasions and also during which time the Crafts made good faith effort as the District Court found to resolve their dispute with Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.335" offset="7337331">The dispute that developed, occurred because of double computer billing that was being sent to the Crafts' residence. And during this period, Mrs. Craft made several efforts even to the point of going to the offices of Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division and spending the entire day in an effort to ascertain the reasons for the terminations and to try to straighten up the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.700" offset="7438790">There is one important fact that should be noted in this that is important to a proper resolution of this case and that is that Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division then as now has no orderly dispute resolution process and that is why Mrs. Craft was unable to resolve her dispute with the Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.502" offset="7525935">Mr. Graves has indicated that Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division did not harshly treat the Crafts, the record is quite contrary in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.085" offset="7568253">On one occasion when Mrs. Craft called to explain that her bill had been paid she was met with a response, pay it again and on another occasion when she was talking with someone at the Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division concerning her bill, she was actually cursed by one of the employees, but the important point is that no dispute resolution process exists within Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division.</text>
