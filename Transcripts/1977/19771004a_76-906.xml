            <label>Mr. Arnold T. Aikens</label>
            <text syncTime="89.829" offset="439225">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.226" offset="452809">This matter is before the court on petition of certiorari to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.359" offset="477364">The case arises under the Age Discrimination Act and presents a very narrow issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.273" offset="505053">That is whether an involuntary retirement of a person under age 65 pursuant to a bona fide pension plan, adopted many years before the Act is permissible without further justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.946" offset="563672">A stipulation in this case has been entered in to as to the facts and they maybe very briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.669" offset="598572">The respondent McMann began his employment with United Air lines in 1944 and during the course of his career, he held several positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.118" offset="644443">He was retired at the age of 60 in 1973 and at that time held the position of technical specialist aircraft systems, which is a flight management position.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.446" offset="701703">At the time, respondent began his employment with United.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.493" offset="721870">The United had a pension plan in existence, its membership was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.936" offset="743708">Respondent did not elect to join that plan until several years later in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.403" offset="773592">At the time, he joined the plan his application card indicated that the normal retirement age was 60 years, thereafter he received annual reports from the company describing the benefits he had accrued and on the face of each of these reports the normal retirement age was stated as 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.355" offset="869409">Prior to his retirement in 1973, respondent notified the Secretary of Labor that he intended to sue on the ground that his retirement violated the Age Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.696" offset="926670">The Labor Department responded that United's plan was a bona fide plan, and in as much as it had been adopted many, many years before the Act that it did not appear to be a subterfuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.474" offset="989782">Respondent, then filed his action in the Eastern District of Virgina, the case was submitted on cross motions for summary judgment and summary judgment was granted in favor of United.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.578" offset="1042236">He appealed to the Fourth Circuit, claiming that his retirement violated the Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.782" offset="1075045">United contended that an expressed exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.127" offset="1092495">Section 4(b)2, 4(f)2 expressly provided that involuntary retirement was authorized pursuant to a bona fide plan that was not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.504" offset="1157906">United relied upon then the only appellate decision Brennan v. Taft Broadcasting, and said that in as much is its plan had preexisted the Act by some 26 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.114" offset="1212345">That it therefore could not be a subterfuge which was the holding in the Taft case.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.180" offset="1240662">The Fourth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.776" offset="1255081">The substance of its holding was that any involuntary retirement is presumed to be a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.614" offset="1298445">Looking to the history, the legislative history of the Act, the court said that in order to avoid the condemnation of subterfuge, the employer must prove that the retirement related to either an economic or a business purpose and not simply age.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.606" offset="1386320">In this decision, the Fourth Circuit stands alone, the Second , Third, Fifth and Ninth are now in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.313" offset="1425191">Two sections of the Act are pertinent to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.258" offset="1444939">Section 4(a) provides that it should be unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against individual with respect his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of the individual's age.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.107" offset="2768407">A Section 4(F)2 of the Statue provides that it shall not be unlawful for an employer to observe the terms of a Bona fide Seniority System or any Bona fide Employee Benefit Plan such as a retirement,pension or insurance plan which is not subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act, except that no such employee benefit plan shall excuse the failure to hire any individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.768" offset="2890973">Three cases essentially have focused on this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.482" offset="2909886">The first of this being the Taft case from the Fifth Circuit and it should be noted and I think that while it is alleged that the language of this provision is not plain, both Brennan and McMann have both stated that the language is unambiguous, the problem has been in the difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.725" offset="3006853">The difficulty with applying the terms subterfuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.395" offset="3021481">In Taft, the Court applied dictionary definitions saying that the bona fide plan was a genuine authentic good faith plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.967" offset="3063800">It defined subterfuge as deception by artifice or stratagem thus applying a state of mind concept to the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.922" offset="3111656">The Court in Taft held that since the plan, it was involved in there preceded the Act by some six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.877" offset="3143421">It obviously could not have been subterfuge to evade the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.973" offset="3167871">United agreed with the holding of that case and relied upon at in McMann in.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.200" offset="3188769">And as much as its plan was conceded to be bona fide paying reasonable benefits and had existed some 26 years before the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.665" offset="3230565">The McMann case rejected that definition and presumed any early retirement or the retirement before the age of 65 to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.997" offset="3303917">It said that one must look to a reason unrelated to age to justify an involuntary retirement, and accordingly the Court said that that reason should be a business or an economic reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.329" offset="3373298">The Court said that this conclusion was justified by its review of the history and the history that it looked to, was a single reference related to the 4F2 exception, that history provided that this section of the Act does apply to new and existing plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.372" offset="3485416">That the exception emphasizes the primary purpose of the bill which is hiring and it said that Congress's purpose was to remove plans as a barrier to hiring persons within the protected age group.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.434" offset="3557723">The history that the Court relies upon is really limited to the last phrase of section 4(F)2.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.284" offset="3593040">This is sometimes been referred towards the Javits Amendment</text>
            <text syncTime="882.079" offset="3608296">Senator Javits was extremely concerned that corporations would not hire persons within the protected age group simply because of the high cost of putting them into pension or benefit plans for a very limited number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.671" offset="3682588">He sought therefore to eliminate that as a barrier which of course that exemption has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.736" offset="3710905">That exemption however addresses itself to another condition as well as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.399" offset="3737550">Nevertheless it appears that what the Fourth Circuit has done is to say that if there is an economic factor to be considered in connection with the hiring of an individual, then there should be an economic factor considered with respect to involuntary retirement and so the Court imposed that as a criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.416" offset="3825635">The distinction however is that the Congress imposed the economic factor with respect to that portion of the exemption covering hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.803" offset="3867117">It did not do so as to involuntary retirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1064.637" offset="4338471">It therefore concluded that the subterfuge as used in Section 4(f)2 means a shame plan or one that does not provide reasonable benefits to the retire age.</text>
