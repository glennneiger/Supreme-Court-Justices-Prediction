            <text syncTime="50.135" offset="280503">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.356" offset="293355">This case is before this Court on a writ of certiorari to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.356" offset="313313">The case involves the application of Section 13028 of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, as it applies to a Santa Clara Pueblo membership ordinance enacted in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.974" offset="363781">The ordinance provides that children born of Santa Clara males and Santa Clara females shall be Santa Clara members.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.095" offset="396278">Children born of Santa Clara males and non- Santa Clara females would likewise be members of tribe whereas children born of Santa Clara females and non-Santa Clara males would not be members of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.406" offset="445597">The plaintiffs alleged the ordinance, violates the Indian Civil Rights Act and the defendants have continuously raised the lack of jurisdiction and the sovereign immunity of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.907" offset="491572">The District Court of the District of New Mexico found that there was in fact jurisdiction but that the ordinance did not violate the Indian Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.650" offset="526576">The Tenth Circuit reversed not discussing tribal immunity to any extent whatsoever and finding that in fact there was jurisdiction and that the ordinance was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.112" offset="584359">A little factual background on Santa Clara Pueblo, I believe would be beneficial before going into further argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.270" offset="605048">It is a small reservation, some 4,800 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.287" offset="621035">The membership is small approximately 1,200 members, located in the northern part of the State of New Mexico.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.468" offset="677773">The tribe has organized pursuant to constitution, one of the Organization Act of 1934 and it is un-contradicted that the tribe has existed as a distinct social and cultural unit for at least 700 years and has existed at its present location for some 300 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.631" offset="754469">It has been surrounded first by the Spaniards and now by the United States of America and has continued to exist notwithstanding the fact that it has been surrounded by an alien culture.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.974" offset="875781">The Governor, the Chief Executive Officer of the tribe that is empowered to run a day-to-day functions of the tribe primarily and he serves on the council and can only vote on the council at such time as the council may have a tribe vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.050" offset="936176">The council under the constitution has the authority to determine membership in the tribe and has thus done under the 1939 ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.301" offset="977136">The defendants in this case, Santa Clara Pueblo have from the very outset, claimed that the 1939 ordinance is a written embodiment of pre-existing unwritten rules of membership and I might point out that prior to 1935, nothing was written within the Pueblo culture.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.839" offset="1051324">They had no written rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.437" offset="1061669">They have further alleged throughout and do so that the ordinance is essential to the cultural and religious heritage and vital to the very existence of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.886" offset="1099494">There has been no variants from that ordinance from the time it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.961" offset="1119765">The plaintiffs Mrs. Martinez is a Santa Clara Pueblan daughter of both parents who were of Santa Clara.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.603" offset="1154351">Under the ordinance, her children are not members of the Santa Clara because she is married to an Navajo from a separate reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.220" offset="1208790">The testimony was clear that the children could be registered in an Idaho nation, had they so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.895" offset="1235540">The question presented for this Court as I see them are whether or not there is an implied waiver of sovereign immunity in the 1968 Civil Rights Act and whether in fact, the Civil Rights Act gives Federal Court’s jurisdiction in anything other than habeas corpus provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.335" offset="1489241">The argument has been made that it would apply to the Governor and based on what I have indicated a while ago, the Governor just has the power to run the day-to-day affairs and has no power beyond that into the counciliary. So I do not know what effect that would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.513" offset="1549949">If as Your Honor pointed out, there is jurisdiction then we get to the question of what standard of Equal Protection should apply under the Indian Civil Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.327" offset="1713267">Speaking of the waiver of the sovereign immunity, there has been over 145 years that this Court held the tribes are sovereign nations.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.475" offset="1901871">It must be an expressed waiver and Congress must spell this out.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.408" offset="1973551">The reasons for this principle have been pointed out are two-fold, one is because of the limited resources of the tribes to be constantly in Court defending their culture, their way of living and the other is so that they may continue to perpetuate their culture without interference from an outside alien culture if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.501" offset="2077936">The plaintiffs in, I might point it out that there has been a half-a-million dollar judgment under the Indian Civil Rights Act in the Tenth Circuit as is pointed out by amicus, just recently.</text>

Burton; however, the Tenth Circuit did apply the improper rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.002" offset="5759948">The undisputed testimony was that from a Dr. Allis who was hired by the Government not by the tribe initially that the culture would eventually break down and be lost if this ordinance were not allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.442" offset="6417711">In fact, the expressed witness for defendants to which counsel just referred to find the Santa Clara Indian as a Tewa Indian as one who speaks the Tewa language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.975" offset="8251820">Furthermore, the legislative history is a confusing point here because we are relying on different parts of the legislative history and I think it is really essential to answer this question and some others to make clear where the legislative history lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.164" offset="8312634">Counsel for defendants has principally relied upon hearings, upon testimony before hearings including testimony of persons who oppose passage of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2111.246" offset="8524957">We submit that the report of the Senators themselves indicates that they contemplated that the federal courts would review membership cases and the other cases in that report are there two cases on freedom free exercise of religion, and there is a case on tribal taxation of members and there is a case on tribal taxation of non-Indians on the reservation and all of those the Senators were expressing disapproval of the lack of a remedy for those plaintiffs and they were saying that this is why this Act was passed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="2269.542" offset="9158060">Well, the written constitution of the Pueblo says that he has all the executive authority of the Pueblo, the authority to enforce all the laws and we assume that included membership laws, we still assume that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.475" offset="9205812">We take the written laws at their word, it is in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.790" offset="9223053">We would point out in connection with the scope of the Act again that the Act on its face limits and these are the words of the statute, “All governmental powers possessed by an Indian tribe executive, legislative and judicial and all offices, bodies and tribunals by and through which they are executed including courts”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.418" offset="9297659">So it is comprehensive the Act on its face and its terms is comprehensive in defining what it limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.713" offset="9330782">That relates to one of arguments that has been made by my brother which is that the Equal Protection clause of this Act should be interpreted only to enforce existing tribal rules evenhandedly, I believe they call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.506" offset="9397969">In the first place of course, the Act says that the legislative councils of the tribe are limited as well as the administrative and this evenhanded rule of course would only go to the administration of a law, and in the second place such a rule would make a marker here of the Equal Protection Clause because as soon as an uneven application arose all that would be necessary to make it immune from any review would be for the legislature to codify that rule, so that rule makes no sense to us and we submit that Congress could not possibly have intended such an undertaking as particularly since Congress paid special attention, the Senators paid special attention to the Equal Protection Clause in this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.994" offset="9555958">When the law was drafted by the Interior Department, there was an Equal Protection Clause in it, that guaranteed equal protection only to members of the tribe and the Senators did not like that and they changed it in guaranteed equal protection to all persons under tribal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.174" offset="9608620">A point which has been noted by lower courts in some other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.752" offset="9622936">So the Senators took a particular look at the question of Equal Protection and they rejected an error with clause, in which regard I might add, there a reply brief was just filed by petitioners in which they quote some legislative history about Equal Protection and they quote legislative history about that rejected clause applying only to members of the tribe and they do not disclose that and so I think the Court should note that that legislative history does not apply to the clause that was actually enacted by the Congress.</text>
