            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="79997">The second case involving solicitation by a lawyer is 76-1650, Ohralik against the Ohio State Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.013" offset="123987">It comes to us on appeal from the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.550" offset="138093">The solicitation in this case is quite different from that I have just described in Primus.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.554" offset="170172">The appellant, an Ohio lawyer, professionally solicited two young women who had been injured and hospitalized following an automobile accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.183" offset="204653">He approached one in the hospital room while she was in traction.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.813" offset="219177">He solicited the other at her home the day after she left the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.890" offset="239553">He advised both of them that they had good claims for damages and offered to represent to each of them on a contingent fee basis of one-third of any recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.675" offset="286678">The young women separately agreed to the tender representation, but thereafter sought to discharge appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.779" offset="315099">But he resisted, they file complaints with the local bar grievance committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.337" offset="341326">After due proceedings and on appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio, appellant was found guilty of violating the Disciplinary Rules against solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.790" offset="383122">The court rejected appellant's reliance on the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.725" offset="406841">In Bates against the State Bar of Arizona, decided last term, the Court held that lawyers could not be disciplined for truthfully advertising the availability of routine legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.519" offset="462012">Such advertisement were viewed as commercial speech, entitled to a measure of constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.605" offset="490328">The Court reserved the question in that case as to the right of a state to discipline lawyers for in-person commercial solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.466" offset="537767">The state has a strong interest in protecting the public from the aspects of solicitation that potentially involved fraud, undue influence, overreaching, and other forms of vexatious conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.127" offset="596490">As appellant solicited employment for pecuniary gain under circumstances likely to result in these evils, we hold that the state interest out ways the First Amendment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.836" offset="651243">We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.977" offset="667857">Mr. Justice Marshall filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.275" offset="689068">Mr. Rehnquist concurred in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.982" offset="699830">Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
