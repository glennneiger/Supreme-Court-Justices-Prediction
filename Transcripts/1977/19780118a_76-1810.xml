            <text syncTime="22.676" offset="170704">We are here today because the Court of Appeals refuses to follow the Supreme Court in General Electric versus Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.114" offset="204454">Manhart decision was issued just ten days before the Gilbert decision came down and was directly contrary to the Gilbert decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.802" offset="235174">Nevertheless, two of the three judges refused to change their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.384" offset="253460">We are also here because the Court of Appeals refused to follow the plain language of the statutes and the will of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.572" offset="286270">This is just a question of statutory construction but what the respondents seek is a policy statement from the Court contrary to the plain language of the statute, contrary to the will of congress and contrary to the decisions of this Court in Gilbert and in Nashville, Nashville Gas versus Satty.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.748" offset="370907">In September, a case was filed in the Northern District of California are entitled Retired Public Employees Association versus the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.099" offset="408314">The case is a suit under Title VII by females to recover back retirement contributions and by males to increase retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.641" offset="458469">The California Public Employee Retirement System had both unequal contributions and unequal benefits based on sex differentiated actuarial tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.736" offset="506848">We cite this case simply to emphasize to the Court today that in this particular case, only the female employees are before the Court but the impact of this decision will affect male employees, their spouses and a multitude of Retirements Systems across the country has witnessed the many Amicus briefs that have been filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.987" offset="671942">We would like to point out first four points that we would like to make in argument and then commence the arguments if we may.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.206" offset="704751">First, this case is just an application of the principles in General Electric versus Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.330" offset="733277">Second, Title VII and the Equal Pay Act do not prohibit the practice challenge that is to measure contributions and benefits in retirement plans using sex differentiated mortality tables.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.139" offset="792523">Third, the Lower Courts in order to arrive at the contrary decision, as they did had to abdicate their responsibility and differ totally to decisions of administrative agencies that were contrary to the statutes and contrary to their own authority to issue such bulletins.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.085" offset="876324">And finally, Congress did not intend adapting different standards for discrimination under Title VII then were previously known in 1964 under the Equal Protection clause under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.890" offset="939540">I would like to begin by saying at first; there is no discrimination in the retirement plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.701" offset="958766">The facts are simple, males and females receive the same gross salary but the department simply withholds more for retirement from the female salary than from the males because all the mortality experience and more particularly the department's mortality experience show that women have a greater life expectancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.768" offset="1047060">This is true at all ages and of course, it is true in retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.739" offset="1066913">It is impossible to test or determine individual life expectancy, there is no way you contest for it so you have to fund based on group mortality experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.048" offset="1112157">Group mortality experience showing that women will receive far more pay outs than men; you have only three ways of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.525" offset="1146012">Given the greater life expectancy of females over males, you can either have the females pay the additional cost of their life expectancy or you can have the employer pay it or the females and the employer together or you can have the male subsidize the females.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.151" offset="1216543">In the department’s plan, the females pay slightly higher contribution than the males and that was matched by the department 110 percent so that the department also paid more to females than the males.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.926" offset="1279654">Mr. Oliphant, is it true that members of one race or actuarial principle might have a longer expectancy than members of another race?</text>

            <text syncTime="314.781" offset="1339109">It is possible but our current actuarial statistic seem to indicate that the difference between Whites and Non-Whites which is the only racial characteristics that I have seen studies on indicate that they are getting closer and closer.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.161" offset="1408595">As a matter of fact, in the later years over the 70s, it may be that the Non-Whites are actually outliving the Whites.</text>
