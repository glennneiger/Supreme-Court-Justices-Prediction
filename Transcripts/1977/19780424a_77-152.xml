            <text syncTime="85.994" offset="423861">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.699" offset="442774">This case involves the validity of a no solicitation, no distribution rule as it applies to a nonprofit hospital's cafeteria which is used by patients, their families and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.856" offset="495332">The primary function of a hospital is to provide patient care and critical to that function is providing an atmosphere as free from stress and strain as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.853" offset="539322">The hospital's rule, banning solicitation and distribution of literature which can be disruptive to the care of patients and all patient and family access areas including the cafeteria is clearly in furtherance of that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.619" offset="598359">Congress, in amending the National Labor Relations Act in 1974 to include coverage of nonprofit hospitals explicitly stated that hospitals are unique and expressed its concern for the well being of hospital patients and a need to avoid disruption wherever possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.724" offset="674845">This concern was recognized by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in NLRB versus Baylor, cited in the brief, and the Tneth Circuit Court in NLRB versus St. John's Hospital also cited both of which denied enforcement to Board orders and upheld no solicitation rules in patient access areas of those hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.265" offset="768991">The lead and justification of Beth Israel's rule is graphically demonstrated in this case where union literature was passed out in the cafeteria viciously disparaging the quality of healthcare provided by the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.292" offset="825102">Let us consider the effect on an ambulatory patient visiting with his family in the cafeteria who picks up a union leaflet left on a table with statements such as the following: "They totally ignored me while I was a patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.767" offset="882989">My experience was bewildering, painful and ugly.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.009" offset="895946">I was lucky it was not a complicated delivery.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.644" offset="1330519">Mr. Chandler, I do not claim to be an expert on union organizing tactics but this does not strike me as the ordinary union organizing literature which would be urging claims for added benefits or criticizing in some other way than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.506" offset="1409931">Is there something in the record that suggests why this sort of criticism was resorted to?</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_chandler" startTime="338.171" stopTime="397.671">
            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="338.171" offset="1432605">Your Honor, the Board, National Labor Relations Board, has recognized in numerous cases that union solicitation -- forget about scurrilous propaganda -- but the normal union solicitation as a part of an organizational campaign is potentially disruptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.216" offset="1512749">In the retail store industry and restaurants, they find that this is enough to warrant a broad ban on such activity, union solicitation and distribution wherever customers are present or likely to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.409" offset="1569592">What the hospital is asserting is the same interest that applies to an employer who operates a restaurant or retail store, that patients who are sick and their families who are coming to a hospital setting and understandably anxious and vulnerable, as the Board itself has recognized, should be entitled to at least the same treatment as customers who come into a retail store.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.585" offset="1662274">It is a matter of common sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.379" offset="1741477">The tenor of this literature is geared towards complaints about working conditions as most union campaigns are.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="423.383" offset="1773451">But they do not always in their organizing stage emphasize so much the need for more employees as this literature would appear up here to --</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_chandler" startTime="435.509" stopTime="488.922">
            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="435.509" offset="1821934">Not in other kinds of situations but here we are dealing with a hospital and they are raising concerns that are concerns to patients and here where the hospital has areas that are set aside for employees to engage in this activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.238" offset="1884837">There are employee only areas within the hospital and they may organize, they may distribute literature in those areas without interfering with patients or their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.487" offset="1929872">So the hospital feels that in order to protect patients, to insulate them from the potential disruption of this kind of literature or any kind of disruptive literature, and especially union literature because the Board itself has given its staff approval to banning that kind of distribution because that in and of itself is inherently disruptive according to the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.195" offset="2056723">As a matter of fact, the hospital's rule was promulgated initially during the Vietnam War to avoid demonstrations in the hospital throughout patient care at patient access areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.515" offset="2122029">The rule has been amended since then a number of times, however, the present rule involves a total ban on solicitation and distribution in patient access areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.734" offset="2202904">Mr. Chandler, does the record tell us how often this material actually fell into the hands of patients or visitors?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="537.693" offset="2230698">There is no evidence in the record your Honor to indicate that it fell into patients' hands at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.099" offset="2256298">However, the Board, in its other case precedent, recognizes that leaflets may be left in customer access areas and may be discarded and picked up by a customer and we feel that there is a logical inference that that could happen in this setting as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.280" offset="2341040">Rather than being sensitive to the unique conditions found in the hospital, and to the declared intent of Congress to recognize the special needs of patients, the Board has mechanically applied rules that pseudo factory environment where no patients, customers or third parties are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.627" offset="2426408">I have already alluded to the special circumstances present in a hospital environment involving patient care considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.456" offset="2457755">Inherent in the nature of the hospital operation and the treatment of patients, is the fact that patients are understandably anxious and vulnerable and likely to be upset by union solicitation and distribution in patient access areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.210" offset="2508746">The Board itself recognized this principle prior to the 74 amendments, in the Guyan Valley Hospital case which was cited in the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.401" offset="2549497">Mr. Chandler, do you think it necessarily follows that a patient would upset by a leaflet that said, "Beth Israel employees get only so much an hour, Peter Bent Brigham employees get 10% more", do you think that would upset a patient?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="637.072" offset="2628178">I think your Honor, that there is a question of degrees and if the hospital were to allow some union solicitation on a selective basis, it would create problems of deciding which to allow and which not to allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.203" offset="2708739">In that particular case, I would think that there could be a problem from a patient's point of view feeling that there is some undercurrent within the hospital that employees are dissatisfied with the hospital and they may not be able to go about their duties properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.510" offset="2801944">As I was saying earlier, the Board, in Guyan Valley, affirmed administrative law judge's decision, and the administrative law judge found that the hospital services ill individuals who in their weakened condition may readily be upset if they overhear anti union, pro union arguments among employees while they, the patients, are in their rooms or in the halls or elevators and taking into consideration the nature of the institution and the necessity for protecting patients, any presumption of illegality is over come.</text>

            <text syncTime="732.642" offset="3010506">The Board recognized that a hospital creates a special circumstance and they allowed just like they did with retail stores, they allowed an exception to the normal presumptions and said that in patient access areas and they defined them as the gift shop, elevators, stairways, corridors, patient rooms and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.562" offset="3094202">This was in the administrative law judge's decision affirmed by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.568" offset="3110189">They recognized that solicitation could be prohibited, however after the amendments were enacted in 1974, a-year-and-a-half later, despite the fact that the Board conceded before the Tenth Circuit in the St. John's case, that Guyan Valley represented an accurate state of the law at the time the amendments went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.497" offset="3217918">A-year-and-a-half later, in the St. John's decision, the Board's St. John's decision, the Board without articulating any reason for departing from the Guyan Valley analysis, without medical evidence, without any medical expertise, reversed its position and they ruled that although special conditions exist in a hospital that although a tranquil atmosphere is essential to a hospital's primary function of providing patient care, and that although solicitation might be unsettling to patients in strictly patient care areas that solicitation could have no adverse effect on patients in other areas such as cafeterias, lounges and alike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.907" offset="7079547">We submit that the legislative history of that statute and those amendments shows quite contrary that Congress intended to leave it to the Board's discretion to continue the exercise its preexisting responsibility to accommodate employee's organizational rights and the employer's management interest which in the case of a hospital is to maintain patient care.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.297" offset="7389151">The remainder of the meals were purchased by students, volunteers, doctors, nurses, and others.</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.869" offset="12203414">One of those presumptions is that employee solicitation and distribution of union literature in nonworking areas and during nonworking times is presumptively lawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.128" offset="12992416">I do not think there will be the doctors would be disturbed nor does the hospital argue it, and so the question is whether the 1.5% patients and 10% guests argue for a different presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.775" offset="13059081">I think that the Board preceded perfectly, rationally in the following sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.415" offset="13089592">There are two lines of cases as we have developed and contrary to the impression created by the petitioner that there is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.748" offset="13130969">Line one says that where you have an employee only cafeteria, a restriction to this type is presumptively unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.309" offset="13173183">Presumption number two says that where the facility is primarily for the general public, such rules are presumptively lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.359" offset="13213412">And what the Board did here was to say that to begin this process as a working hypothesis, we will say that this rule is presumptively unlawful and put the burden on the hospital which after all claims to have the medical expertise to show that there are special circumstances which make the rule lawful, and the hospital did not accept that invitation instead, they argued what the Board's presumption is arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.674" offset="13342666">We think that that places a very heavy burden on them under this Court's general law regarding the review of administrative agency determinations and that they have not begun to carry it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3720.881" offset="14963407">Briefly there are several points in reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.587" offset="14974274">The record Appendix verifies that there are approximately 700 lockers in just four of locker areas to which all of that Beth Israel employees have access.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.299" offset="15013144">Secondly, brother counsel stated that the Board's rule is a rule prohibiting solicitation during work time is presumptively valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.886" offset="15055463">What he neglected to say was that the Board rule also says it is presumptively valid to prohibit solicitation in work areas and public or customer access areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.938" offset="15095691">Here the Beth Israel cafeteria apart from being a place where employees are working is a customer access area and the customers here happen to be patients and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.357" offset="15137383">At the very least the hospital is entitled to the same consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.785" offset="15163087">The question of numbers has been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.666" offset="15174581">The Board has never raised question of how many customers are in a particular area in an elevator of a department store or in a cafeteria in a department store.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.383" offset="15221497">We see no reason to apply it in a cafeteria setting especially here where there are substantial numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.671" offset="15250649">The primary function that brother counsel mentioned that apply in the retail store I cite again the Goldblatt Case because in that case because in that case the primary function was selling merchandise cafeteria and that case was not for selling merchandise or was with selling food and adjunct to that operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.429" offset="15337689">In the remand that brother counsel referred to in the related Beth Israel Case, the Administrator law judge made certain findings of fact and I would read from the addendum in the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3832.566" offset="15410205">"Solicitation and distribution in patient access areas can interfere with patient care functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.778" offset="15430999">Such activity can be disturbing to patients and their families.</text>

            <text syncTime="3857.166" offset="15508635">Curiously, the Board in the McDonald's Hamburger case apply the restaurant rule by saying and I quote from the decision of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.166" offset="15552625">"Union solicitation can lead to heated verbal exchanges among the solicitors and those solicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.389" offset="15573523">Indeed it is certainly not unknown for violent physical exchanges to occur in such circumstances should such that be in the presence of customers would not be unlikely the employer can well foresee the destruction of the rapport which this employer and any normal employer would like to have with its customers."</text>

            <text syncTime="4013.505" offset="16133902">The hospital, I am talking about medical people who make a determination as to what may be detrimental to patients in a hospital setting, made a determination consistent with the Board's own case law that union solicitation is potentially disruptive.</text>

            <text syncTime="4037.010" offset="16227943">The hospital has indicated to its staff not to discuss concerns inpatient access areas that could affect patients and this is a consistent concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.984" offset="16263887">The Baylor Court and the DC Circuit has recognized that this is controversial material that should be banned as opposed to innocuous things, and unless the Board shows that the hospital's administration has made a bad medical judgment, then we see no basis for the Board to insist upon a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.776" offset="16370989">As this Court determined recently in the University of Missouri Case against Horowitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.507" offset="16405993">That involved the academic field, but there they recognized that academic people are better able to make determinations as to academic problems and subject matter than the Courts or Administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.109" offset="16468374">Here we would suggest that the same principle applies in a medical field especially where there was no medical evidence or medical testimony other than the Board's own medical perceptions that supports this distinction for ambulatory as against non-ambulatory.</text>
