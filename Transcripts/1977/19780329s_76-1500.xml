            <text syncTime="15.472" offset="141952">Massachusetts v. the United States is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.396" offset="177583">The Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, a federal statute imposes an annual flat fee registration tax on all civil aircraft, including such aircraft owned by the States and by the Federal Government, that fly in the navigable airspace of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.094" offset="276430">That tax was imposed upon a helicopter owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and used by the state in the state police work.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.218" offset="320943">The Commonwealth instituted this action contending that the United States may not constitutionally impose a tax that directly affects the central and traditional state function of uprating a police force.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.126" offset="384577">The Court of Appeals held that the registration tax was a user fee and therefore did not implicate the constitutional doctrine of the implied immunity of state governments from federal taxation.</text>
