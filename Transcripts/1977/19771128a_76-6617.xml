            <label>Mr. John T. Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="76.591" offset="386342">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I am John Chandler attorney for the petitioner Richard Greene admitted pro hac vice in case number 76-6617.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.780" offset="439005">This case arises upon the petition for the writ of certiorari to review the decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which affirmed the denial of Habeas Corpus relief of the United States District Court for the middle district of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.535" offset="498042">The issues presented in this case are twofold, one brought forth by the petitioner and one brought forth by the respondent Raymond Massey.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.385" offset="541509">First issue is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause in Fifth Amendment bars retrial of the defendant for the same offense where in Appellate Court reverses a conviction because the evidence was insufficient to prove the charged crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.491" offset="597934">Secondary issue, in one which respondent would have as threshold is whether Federal Habeas Corpus review of the Double Jeopardy Claim is precluded after consideration of that claim by the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.188" offset="664703">The case briefly and it is a case that arises some 13 years ago or almost 13 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.602" offset="694378">In 1965, Richard Greene and Jose Manuel Sosa were found guilty of first degree murder, they had a trial by jury, they made both a motion for directed verdict of acquittal and a motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.571" offset="762192">It is noteworthy that the motion for new trial was stricken and never was operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.326" offset="785180">On November in 1968, the Florida Supreme Court, on appeal of this death penalty case reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.111" offset="828334">Due to the insufficiency of the evidence, this was a per curiam decision and was unequivocal as for the reason for the reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.978" offset="871802">Upon remand of this reversal by the Supreme Court of Florida, there was a change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.539" offset="902104">Defendant was tried then in Orange County, Florida instead of in Hillsborough County, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.758" offset="938989">In the trial Court, at that time the defendant made a motion to dismiss on Double Jeopardy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.385" offset="969500">Alternatively, he asked that the case be transferred to the Criminal Court of Record because in Florida the Criminal Court of Record would then have jurisdiction so as we will no longer be operating in a first degree murder situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.914" offset="1031567">That motion was denied, at that time the defendant applied to the Second District Court of Appeal with a suggestion for writ of prohibition to prevent again on Double Jeopardy grounds, his retrial for that same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.758" offset="1098962">Now this was denied by the Second District Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.113" offset="1124354">On January 15th, 1972 after defendant was retried again for first degree murder, he was convicted and the prosecution at that time presented new witnesses and the defendant after the trial was sentenced to life imprisonment this time rather than the death penalty upon a jury verdict recommending mercy.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.335" offset="1345245">The defendant then appealed to the Fourth District Court of Appeal of Florida which affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.603" offset="1370322">That Court recognize that the issue was an intriguing one intellectually but felt for some reason not apparent in Florida law that they could not decide the Double Jeopardy claim because of the Second District Court's opinion which had said that the retrial did not violate Double Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.842" offset="1443256">They said that the issue was res judicata and therefore they could not decide it.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.701" offset="1458721">Or might they not have found, felt themselves bound by the earlier opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida too which said the evidence did not meet the reasonable doubt, standard and went on to city, interest of just as require a new trial?</text>

            <text syncTime="363.218" offset="1532804">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I do not believe the Fourth District Court of Appeal was at all motivated by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.254" offset="1560912">It was motivated only by the Second District Court of Appeals opinion which had denied the writ of prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.094" offset="1584318">The Second District Court of Appeal had for some reason or had recognized a standard of proof which they said that the Supreme Court did not reverse because of the insufficiency of the evidence but that certainly is not apparent from the Supreme Court's opinion and also was not required by the Second District Court of Appeal to recognize that type of legal proposition.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="400.977" offset="1683792">It certainly is apparent from the Supreme Court of Florida's opinion though, that the Supreme Court of Florida intended that there be an another trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. John T. Chandler</label>
            <text syncTime="408.247" offset="1712945">Absolutely that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.905" offset="1727573">In 1975, this Court denied a writ of certiorari on this issue and in 1976 the U.S. District Court from middle district of Florida denied a petition for writ of Habeas Corpus recognizing, also the interesting nature of the issue and saying that it would have been inclined to grant the writ, had the matter been of matter of first impression in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit but that because there was prior precedent in it and because the prior precedent of the Fifth Circuit would allow retrial, he had to deny the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.749" offset="1866962">The US Court of Appeals in January of 1977, affirmed the Fifth Circuit Court opinion on the basis of the precedent that the District Court had recognized namely, United States versus Bass and Musquiz versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.779" offset="1955047">Now if the petitioner's proposition in position that the Florida Supreme Court held the evidence to be insufficient as a matter of law, both the US District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recognized that this was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.716" offset="2014816">If the Trial Judge had directed acquittal when the original motion for directed verdict had been made, obviously there could be no retrial on the Double Jeopardy principles because at that time the man had been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.707" offset="2066747">The Florida Supreme Court's holding indicates that the Trial Judge erred in not in acquitting because this is as much a function of the Trial Judge to direct a verdict of acquittal on proper motion made as it is for the Appellate Court to reverse on the insufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.001" offset="2131949">Then why should the not the appellate find the insufficient evidence, not entitle a defendant to a directed verdict of acquittal?</text>
            <text syncTime="520.001" offset="2159952">The reason, and which results in what I believe is an anomaly lies I think in the history of the Double Jeopardy cases before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.023" offset="2551998">The earliest being United States versus Ball and in the Ball case, the reversal was based upon an insufficient indictment and in that situation, we did not quibble and we did not argue that retrial would not be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.710" offset="2614796">The first case, and the real troubling case and the case that troubles all of the Circuit Courts of United States and many of the trial of the State Courts is Brian versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.233" offset="2660876">Where this Court said that retrial after finding of insufficient evidence did not violate the Double Jeopardy principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.198" offset="2688670">Apparently, because of a notion that by appealing the defendant waived the Double Jeopardy argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.503" offset="2721898">At that time, the possibility that there may be a reason to delineate reversals for insufficient evidence and reversals for other trial era did not seem to -- it was not apparent to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.352" offset="2765366">But in Sapir versus United State, this Court reversed a Circuit Court, United States Circuit Court opinion of the Tenth Circuit, which had first, reversed a conviction and directed acquittal and then on rehearing, under its power, under 28 USC section 2106 decided that it would remand for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.205" offset="2888768">This Court reversed the District or the Circuit Court's opinion per curium without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.050" offset="2920115">In a concurring opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas, it was stated that the reason for this was when a directed -- that a finding of insufficiency of the evidence was entitled to the same treatment as if the trial judge had directed a verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.957" offset="2995766">For that reason, Mr. Justice Douglas said, they must reinstate the initial reversal and so that the man could not be retried.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.064" offset="6836184">Mr. Chief justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.189" offset="6852693">I have raised two issues in my brief the stone issue point A and my point B the Double Jeopardy, claim I want to argue the stone issue in the latter part of my argument if Your Honors please to reserve several minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.477" offset="6901803">We feel Your Honors that there is no Double Jeopardy violation when an Appellate Court reverses on insufficiency of the evidence grounds as well as others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.783" offset="6939106">We feel that the Federal Statutes, one is 2106 as well as Florida Appellate Rule 6.16 (B) in Florida as well as some 30 States Statutes allow an Appellate Court to reverse on insufficiency of the evidence grounds as well as reversible error grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.701" offset="7010682">We feel that in our situation the case of bar where the Appellate Court felt that it was appropriate and just using the words in the interest of justice, the trial would be proper upon remand it was within their power and discretion, despite the sufficiency of the evidence in the case of bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.195" offset="7084660">We feel also if Your Honors please basically that the case law enunciated by this honorable Court through the years has permitted what the Florida Supreme Court did in the first reversal back in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.366" offset="7141398">The Bryan case reversed where the State rather Government there failed to make Prima Facie case,Prima Facie evidence case according to the position taken by the petitioner there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.174" offset="7180582">The Yates case where this Court reversed and ordered a new trial and discharged other defendants and went ahead and said if there has been some evidence as to conspiracy in the 1957 case, I think the words were used probably insufficient as to some and there was some evidence where the jury could have indeed convicted as swither, so it was reversal for a new trial as a sum clearly within the Court's discretion rather than review the history going back to US V. Ball and the more recent cases of Sapir and Foreman which do indicate that in Appellate Court if Your Honors please do have that power to reverse for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.126" offset="7336481">We also feel if Your Honors please that there is nothing inconsistent with Double Jeopardy Clause that would preclude in Appellate Court to reverse for a new trial that the public policy reasons clearly favor the Government or the prosecution in the case at bar and we do not say in all the situations that an Appellate Court can go ahead and reverse for a new trial or Government may take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.849" offset="7431358">For example, if the jury comes back not guilty or if a Trial Judge enter the judgment of a acquittal then it is clear that Government can not take an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.541" offset="7466048">Also if there is prosecutorial overreaching in the sense as US V. Jorn where discharge of the jury occurred without the defendant's behest, without his request and it did not fall into what is been termed adamant necessity or absolute necessity, going back to US V. Perez we feel new situations, the law is clear.</text>

Denets (ph) and US v. Lee, does indeed support the contention that where defense requests a certain relief as defense counsel did in the Trial Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.757" offset="12862946">There is nothing to preclude in Appellate Court or Trial of Court to go ahead and grant the defendant exactly what he requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.802" offset="12891158">That is also what I am saying and of course, good policy reasons for that which is that the burden is on defense Counsel to go ahead and request certain types of relief as again a motion for mistrial and examples of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.905" offset="12951554">If Your Honors please that is a basically the State's position is well supplemented by the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.061" offset="12984154">If I have a few minutes I would like to basically just argue our stone proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.685" offset="13002649">There is no petition for certiorari or whatever file by State to this Court, I believe does have power to go ahead and look at the issue after Swain v. Pressley the District of Columbia Statute goes ahead and holds, it has no suspension so called writ of Habeas Corpus to go ahead and a preclude the defendant from having his sentence and judgment reviewed ultimately by an Appellate Court and the Constitution of course, does not mandate more than one appeal indeed it does not even mandate one appeal according to some of the recent indications by this honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.749" offset="13146949">I would also submit that 2254 D requires petitioner to go ahead and allege that there are some kind of deficiencies in the state proceedings that was not done in the case at bar, and I would submit that there is obviously presumption of correctness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.614" offset="13214345">Also 2254 E says that where the evidence is ample that the burden and the duty is on the applicant to go ahead and submit the transcripts and trial proceedings that was not done here and again it is not the duty of the appellee, if Your Honors, please to go ahead and submit this materials to the Trial Court or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.174" offset="13304625">That is as to the Stone issue, if Your Honors have any questions I will be please to answer them, otherwise, I would -- in sum I would say that the Double Jeopardy Clause is invariably been read by this Court to be a balancing of the equities in situations and I would submit if Your Honors please that the policy arguments that I argued here in my brief do allow an Appellate Court in the interest of justice to go ahead and reverse for a new trial.</text>
