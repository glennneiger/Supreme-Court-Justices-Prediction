            <text syncTime="16.004" offset="143937">In 76-1137, Fulman, a personal holding company distributed stock of another company to it's shareholders as a deficiency dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.812" offset="199212">The stock had a fair market value of $32,525 but on it's books and adjusted basis was only $18,725.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.639" offset="266503">Now there is a treasury regulation that provides that a personal holding company in these circumstances is entitled to a dividend paid deduction only in the amount of the stocks adjusted basis, that is in this case $18,725 and this case involves an attack on the validity of that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.777" offset="375068">The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit sustained the validity of the regulation but that decision is in conflict with a decision of the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit which held that the regulation was invalid and we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.939" offset="455734">We conclude with the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that the regulation is valid and affirm it's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.532" offset="494082">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion concurring in the judgment and concurring in part with the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.159" offset="528564">Mr. Justice Powell dissents and has a filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
