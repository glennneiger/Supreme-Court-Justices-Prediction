            <text syncTime="11.848" offset="152806">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.954" offset="165240">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.514" offset="191467">It involves a First Amendment problem and involves the privacy statute of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.145" offset="209962">On file originally, there was a jury verdict of $175,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.735" offset="228352">Reversed on appeal, was being grossly excessive and for prejudicial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.190" offset="246220">Upheld however, on liability with the presiding Justice Botein dissenting in a -- on a written opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.650" offset="275999">Retrial without a jury, a $30,000 award that went up to -- direct to the Court of Appeals, affirmed with -- dissenting, they affirmed on the opinions of the Appellate Division with dissenting opinion by Mr. -- by Judge Fuld and Judge Bergan along the same lines as presiding Justice Botein.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.522" offset="355516">There are three factual elements that go into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.108" offset="373802">First, a 1952 incident in which Mr. Hill, the appellee and his family were held prisoner by three escaped convicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.980" offset="417374">Secondly, a book written in 1953 by one Joseph Hayes, later converted by him into a play in a motion picture called “The Desperate Hours” which involved a family held prisoner by three convicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.010" offset="481426">And lastly, a reporting by Life Magazine in February of 1955 when the play appeared on Broadway which involved a prominent mention of the Hill family in connection with the recording on that play.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.969" offset="549345">I think I have two main functions today.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.245" offset="558435">First, to tell you about the facts and probably more detailed than is normal because the facts are somewhat complex but I think once they'll understood, the conclusion flows in actual belief from those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.797" offset="612561">And secondly to suggest one or two propositions that may lead to what I think is a rather simple solution to this case which has been over -- overly complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.008" offset="657492">And I start with Mr. Hill and his family back in September 1952 and he and his wife in their early 40s, they were an attractive couple and they had two teenage daughters, a young son aged 11 and a pair of four-year-old twins.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.790" offset="720603">They lived in the suburbs of Philadelphia and they got up on September 19 of 1952 and they had breakfast and after breakfast, Mr. Hill and their daughters went off, they went to school and he to work and Mrs. Hill turned on the radio and heard a report that there had been three escaped convicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.596" offset="791761">Shortly thereafter and precisely at 8:30 o'clock in the morning, there was a knock in the door and there was the three escaped convicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.275" offset="822481">Two of them was -- were brothers, the older one was the spokesman for the three and they entered the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.771" offset="844528">They held the family captive.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.827" offset="852679">They captured Mr. Hill and their daughters when they returned later on the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.794" offset="868561">They stayed until 3:30 the following morning when they left in the family car.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.579" offset="887787">The family was unharmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.908" offset="897087">Those are the essential elements of that incident.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.620" offset="3207879">Now after these things have happened, we entered the scene and our editor-in-charge of the entertainment world, Tom Prideaux.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.976" offset="3245286">The first he heard of it is in a chance conversation with Robert Montgomery, the director of the play.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.465" offset="3271304">And Robert Montgomery told him that it was based upon an incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.859" offset="3288858">Shortly thereafter, he saw a man named Bradley Smith, a freelance photographer and a friend of Joseph Hayes the author and Bradley Smith said, there is a substantial connection between the play and a real life incident in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.533" offset="3351552">Later, he noticed that the play was opening in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.928" offset="3369106">He called Hayes, the author in Philadelphia and said, “Was there an incident?”</text>
            <text syncTime="819.011" offset="3381436">And Hayes said, “Yes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.237" offset="3390318">And there after at Prideaux's request, Hayes made arrangements to go out to the house which the Hill's formerly had occupied but then they'd left so that pictures could be taken in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.071" offset="3461684">Now based on all of that, and the fact that Mr. Prideaux had read the Time's article, he saw the play twice and he said, “I came to the conclusion that the play was the heart and soul of the family's incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.522" offset="3539529">And based on that, I thought that what we finally wrote in the article was completely truthful and true and honest.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.020" offset="3581534">I may say also that is as the case in any Life with Time article, there is a specific researcher assigned to check the matter and her job is to check the facts and put a checkmark over every word to show that she's going back to make sure of his accuracy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="885.599" offset="3647781">And she was the young lady named Laura Ecker at the time of the trial she'd left us and was married named Laura Ludwig.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.857" offset="3676829">And she testified, “Yes, I checked this article and the checkmarks appeared and I was satisfied that it was true and correct and honest.”</text>

            <text syncTime="954.131" offset="3921962">And the fact that the author had made all the preparations for use of this very house which was obviously envisaging a connection between the incident and the house and said nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.813" offset="3972639">Prideaux said, “I assumed after all that that there was a connection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="972.819" offset="3996672">The article itself at pages 15 and following in the record is headed, "True Crime Inspires Tense Play," and it shows the Hill house and then goes on and says, the ordeal of a family trapped by convicts gives Broadway a new thriller, The Desperate Hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.889" offset="4077025">Then it goes to say “Three years ago, Americans all over the country read about the desperate ordeal of a James Hill family who were held prisoners in their home outside Philadelphia by three escaped convicts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.358" offset="4126866">Later, they read about it in Joseph Hayes' novel, The Desperate Hours, inspired by that family's experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.798" offset="4156646">Now they can see the story reenacted in Hayes' Broadway play based on the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.817" offset="4172737">The next year, they were seen in this movie which had been filmed and which is being held up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.393" offset="4191023">The play directed by Robert Montgomery and expertly acted is a heart stopping account of how a family rose to heroism in a crisis then it goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.026" offset="4233550">Now that's the gist of the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.832" offset="4260718">After the summons and complaint served in this action originally named all of these other defendants which I have pointed out to Your Honor and also through three verified complaints said that the play with some fictionalization was based on the Hill's story and that the play constituted a portrayal of the Hill story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.301" offset="4374612">It was at that point that the author of the play Joseph Hayes was examined before trial and obviously being anxious to avoid the effect of those three amended complaints he backpedaled as far as he could on any connection between the incident and the play although he did affirm that the title "True Crime Inspires Tense Play" was a correct and true title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.307" offset="4466667">And did state that later, they read about it in Joseph Hayes novel, “The Desperate Hours” inspired by the family's experience was true and correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.946" offset="4517240">Thereafter, the present complaint was served nameling -- naming Time, Inc. and Hayes and the Desperate Hours Company as the only remaining defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.872" offset="4560917">But this complaint says, it wasn't a portrayal at all and it wasn't based on an incident at all and to have said that was at -- was completely false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.471" offset="4599265">We move for summary judgment that was denied and was affirmed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.444" offset="4615147">The motion for summary judgment is being based on precisely the same grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.116" offset="4629880">I'm now putting forward -- or will be putting forward Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.067" offset="4645658">At the trial, Mr. Hill was merely the sole witness for himself on saying that he had been distressed by this and people would think that he'd lied when he described what had actually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.407" offset="4699052">Hayes was cross-examined a -- cross-examined and he finally admitted on cross-examination that the matter had been triggered in a very direct way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.960" offset="4745237">It was brought out on cross-examination that in 1954 when the novel came out, he had written a little advertising splurge that came out in wings, the Reader's Digest Magazine, stating that the story was based on two incidents, one, the Snyder case in New York and the Hill case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.344" offset="4826843">The Snyder case in New York had no resemblance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.788" offset="4836561">It was merely one convict pulling a woman and her young daughter, a prisoner and killing the daughter as the police closed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.513" offset="4863519">Later, it was brought out that in January 1955 and this is prior to the Life article, he had written an article for the New York Times entitled, “Fact out of Fiction” and he said it was based then on four incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.830" offset="4924750">The Snyder case, the Hill case and two others, one in Detroit that turned out to be just a man driving the girl out on a car and another one, a California episode where some convicts captured a car in a dessert, drove back to a family's home and then were captured as they drove back to town.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.774" offset="7128545">I may say in addition when Mrs. Warren and Brandeis first proposed this “right of privacy” in 1890, they were careful to observe obviously truth or falsity has nothing to do with these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.248" offset="7186432">The American Law Institute says in 1867 dealing with “right of privacy” states specifically in its comments that truth or falsity has nothing to do with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.449" offset="7223212">And my point on this is that you cannot constitutionally test the matter of privacy on the ground of truth or falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.278" offset="7270546">This -- just to test out that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.464" offset="7279323">Last night's paper at an article on Big Fireball startles many in the East and they quoted three gentlemen, Dr. Thomas Nicholson, Chairman of the Hayden Planetarium and Dr. Fred L. Whipple, Director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Dr. C.T. Olivia, President of the American Meteor Society all with conflicting statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.521" offset="7375454">Now let's suppose that as a practical matter one of the reporters for the evening story got mixed up and none of those gentlemen made those statements whatsoever so that it was completely false to have stated that they made those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.714" offset="7432296">What I'm suggesting is that those three gentlemen did have relevant connection to a story about a meteor and that that should be the end of the matter privacy wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.566" offset="7479735">It may be that you're going to get into libel and if you get into libel, truth or to -- falsity is the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.247" offset="7506380">But I'm -- getting the head of my (Inaudible) -- of the game but that's really what I'm (Inaudible) I'm coming to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.808" offset="7528636">Now, I have really two initial points and two corollaries problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.227" offset="7550370">First, privacy cannot constitutionally exist for a public fact which is relevantly connected with the present news or general interest event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.425" offset="7603137">Secondly, the privacy cannot constitutionally exist for a public fact period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.855" offset="7628842">Now if either relevance or the nature -- the public nature of the fact be the only two tests that you have, you don't have the guessing contest which was condemned in Winters against New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.272" offset="7686520">And all we've been doing in this case for 10 and a half years frankly is guessing as to where we're going.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.693" offset="7712225">And I suggest however that as between the two tests constitutionally in trying to put aside -- make some solution to the “right of privacy” on the one hand and the First Amendment on the other hand that it's an easier solution to use the relevance test than to use the public fact test because with the public fact test, you have the constitutional point of can a man put his past in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.542" offset="7847539">Can you say that after awhile a public event which has been reported, he can say to the press, you can't touch it again?</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.746" offset="7876378">It's just as if Roy Riegels on his 1929 wrong way touchdown which was most embarrassing to say, the press can't mention that anymore, this is in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.376" offset="7926951">Now I suggest, this is a slightly tougher question to decide constitutionally on this public fact although I think it is the correct constitutional solution in trying to harmonize the First Amendment and “right of privacy”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.289" offset="9578621">As a solution, the question of is it relevant to a present news event and do you know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.371" offset="9618954">That's the solution that we've mainly suggested in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.634" offset="9631911">It was the solution suggested by Mr. Justice Botein and Judge Fuld and Judge Bergan below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.906" offset="9657093">That's -- follows along your New York Times against Sullivan sort of a -- primary past suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.698" offset="9688231">The second point is, if it's public fact, you never get to that because with the public fact -- well, as the Supreme Court of Alabama said, "You can't do anything because the story of John Lindgren is part of the history of our community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.300" offset="9754582">And I say that once it's part of the history of the community that you can't take it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.833" offset="9772763">But again, that's a more difficult point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.161" offset="9786034">Perhaps the type of statutes you might have to deal with is -- the defense law for instance says that after ten years, truth is no longer a defense for libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.642" offset="9819993">They in effect put your past in your pocket in ten years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.647" offset="9875999">One was the case of the reform prostitute on California, Melvin against Reid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.875" offset="9892927">Another was a similar criminal identification case in Utah, Mau against Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.575" offset="9911735">But every other case which has passed upon in this country has upheld the right and I think it's a constitutional right that once a matter gets in the public news, it stays there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.710" offset="9956248">Now mind you here, we're dealing with a very limited area of the law of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.891" offset="9984982">I'm not touching intrusion or appropriation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3523.642" offset="14199996">I believe that the fundamental issue here cannot be determined unless there is a judgment with regard to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.244" offset="14242419">There has been discussion to the effect that the truth or falsity of the Life article is not material and should not raise a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.186" offset="14298216">But if the Court would permit, I would like to present the facts as we see them for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.606" offset="14331862">And in doing so, let me read from the reply brief of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.535" offset="14363523">The Desperate Hours in a very fundamental way was the reenactment of the Hill incident and the Life article was accurate and substantially more accurate than it needed to be to gain First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.041" offset="14433635">And later on, the differences are superficial differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.929" offset="14461116">Now, as my argument will develop, if those statements or conclusions are correct, this decision by this Court of New York should be reversed both on constitutional grounds and also, I would say parenthetically that this case would not qualify for liability under the law of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.932" offset="14585145">Let us turn to the facts for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.494" offset="14607402">Was this a reenactment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.720" offset="14620254">Now the Court has some primary documents which it can examine to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.298" offset="14642615">Therefore, one, the Life article, two, the play, three, the current news accounts which are in the record written at the time the play came out, and four, an article by the author written at the time the play came out indicating his view as to whether the play was a reenactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.527" offset="14763510">Looking to the point of whether the play was a reenactment however, I think it is fundamentally necessary for us to get away from the superficial and I would state that they are those similarities or differences as far as the cast of characters in the stage setting are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.180" offset="14858177">It doesn't make any difference whether or not it happens that the Hill family, there were five children and in the fictional family there were two children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.032" offset="14893599">It doesn't make any difference that this incident may have taken place in early fall or late fall that in the Hill incident, it occurred in Philadelphia and that in the fictional incident, it occurred in Indianapolis or that the house in the Hill case was a three-storey house and the house in the case of the fictional story was a two-storey house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.255" offset="14994432">All of those factors whether they are similarities or differences relate to the cast of characters into the stage setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.684" offset="15032153">And as the member of this Court, I think we'll agree, the cast of characters in stage setting tell us no more about a play than a picture frame tells us about a portrait or a painting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.974" offset="15093279">The question with regard to the portrait is what's on the canvass?</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.158" offset="15114073">And the key question with regard to the play, what took place in the play?</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.118" offset="15133926">What went on?</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.373" offset="15146883">Now on that point, we have some primary evidence and it comes directly from the article itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3858.267" offset="15538510">What I am saying is that when we look at the Hill incident and the play, we have incidents that instead of being similar except as -- for the cast of characters in the stage settings are concerned are as far apart as they could possibly be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.041" offset="15613534">Let's look at the Hill incident for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.872" offset="15624923">What made it a particularly unusual hostage instance?</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.082" offset="15645717">What made that particularly unusual hostage incident was the fact that it had an absence of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.539" offset="15675601">As Mrs. Hill pointed out, the convicts acted like perfect gentlemen in Time Magazine in a current news report precociously said and titled its account, house party because a complete lack of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.198" offset="15742161">Now what made the play a hit?</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.781" offset="15756581">It wasn't the fact that it was just about hostage instances or that because it happened to relate to the Hill incident which it didn't but what made the play a hit was that it took an old theme as the New York Times review pointed out which many times have been written about in plays it as novels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.825" offset="15840695">And that the author quoting again from the New York Times review, melt the last drop of horror from this macabre situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.323" offset="15878729">So you have the Hill incident distinguished for the fact that it lacked violence completely and you have a play, a three-day reign of terror.</text>
