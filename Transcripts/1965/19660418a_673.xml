            <label>Mr. Paul O'Dwyer</label>
            <text syncTime="34.274" offset="240515">I think it might be well at the outset to give some facts surrounding the history of literacy test in the 19 states where they are in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.979" offset="295267">We've had the problem previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.318" offset="308642">One of the counsel who just addressed you stated and gave the outline and the background of the enactments in both Massachusetts and Connecticut and I may say that the history of literate -- of literacy test indicate that in practically every state where they exist, they were -- they were determining a right to exclude people from voting rather than as qualifications for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.245" offset="432358">I must say that I was somewhat surprised to hear the literacy tests that the statute in New York prescribed as benign by comparison with the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.732" offset="482304">I may say that it was enacted in 1922 at a time when there was absolutely no necessity to enact a literacy test with respect to native born New Yorkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.807" offset="526608">They'd had a school system at that time for almost a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.152" offset="548028">Many attempts had been made previously in the State of New York to enact literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.920" offset="567045">In the convention of 1848, they almost got one through but there were too many people that were talking Dutch in the State at that time so consequently, they weren't able to put it across.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.883" offset="622947">1915, they tried it in 1917, it was successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.565" offset="653667">The lady who appeared here talked about the fact that it was meant for the purpose of attempting to saying the people of New York who are not conversing with English in the industrial plants and that it had for its purpose assisting in many other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.728" offset="738304">I may say to that the history of the hearings more or less belies that.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.705" offset="766203">I am turning to the brief of the American-Jewish Congress at page 27 to read some of the things were said at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.662" offset="809984">Mr. -- one of the arguments presented on behalf of it is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.524" offset="833494">More precious even than forms of Government or the mental qualities of our race by those stand on impaired all are safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.081" offset="871737">They're exposed to a single danger and that is by constantly changing our voting citizenship through the wholesale but valuable and necessary infusion of Southern and Eastern European races.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.675" offset="926072">The danger has begun, we should check it.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.394" offset="940910">That was on the one side proposing the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.571" offset="953657">On the other was Senator Wagner, obviously, that proposal is directed against the foreign born American.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.859" offset="990856">Remembering that the great mass of foreigners that come annually to our shores are simulated into and become part and parcel of the American people because they strive and hope and succeed in acquiring the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.825" offset="1046653">You cannot recognize in the amendment, a clandestine effort to prevent this assimilation of alien blood without citizenship and to segregate and exclude the foreigner from the rights, the privileges, and the opportunities which we have always held out to all men.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.252" offset="1140381">I should think the effect whatever the -- whatever the rhetoric was and I've seen in your brief, there was some rhetoric along racial lines and the lines of bigotry but I see the effect would be an effect of assimilation into American society rather than the dissimilation?</text>

            <text syncTime="276.414" offset="1209031">Whatever -- whatever the end result was, I am speaking here to the point of the polluted origin of the legislation in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.583" offset="1249677">It was at that time that five elected assemblymen were prevented from being seated in the New York State Legislature and a hearing of the type which has never before happen in the State of New York or anywhere else followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.925" offset="1315088">It was in the middle of this type of hysteria that this enactment was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.079" offset="1331702">It was condemned by Governor Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.464" offset="1341210">It was condemned by Senator Wagner.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.320" offset="1348629">It was condemned by the progress of that date but it was enacted in the state of hysteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.253" offset="1416338">It was after it had this period of hysteria had prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.440" offset="1445177">I may say that we come to the questions which are raised here with regard to whether or not the 4 (e) and the New York State statute are intertwined and it would seem to me that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.782" offset="1502542">It would seem that the justification for the passage of 4 (e) has been because of the discriminatory character of the legis -- New York State legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.076" offset="1547682">It would seem that one of the things which I think has been overlooked is that in somewhere about 1946 as a result of a committee from Columbia University, a travel to Puerto Rico to examine the educational facilities there and the results upon the children of Puerto Rican schools and found that our attempt to Englishized had totally failed and it was as a result of that was a new method was developed whereby this appellee and other children born in Puerto Rico have no choice but to read and write, and learn American history and civics through the medium of Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.221" offset="1708283">So that for all intents and purposes, we have -- we are a country of two languages.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.362" offset="1728867">We have fostered one throughout this island.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.435" offset="1741093">We have developed it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.262" offset="1748407">Of the 19 states which have a literacy test, there are some like the State of Louisiana which permitted at least in the language of one's forebears in the mother tongue as well as in English.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.438" offset="7141125">Moreover, New York by amendment of absentee registration, the amendment of absentee voting, the availability of voting to members of the Armed Forces and veterans has made an intelligent effort to get all the citizens of New York State who made possibly be eligible become part of the -- of the electorate of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.062" offset="7267662">And so for -- for instance, the Attorney General of Puerto Rico suggests that New York doesn't care what happens to its Puerto Rican population is a tremendous disservice because a great deal of money and effort is being put into a campaign and has been put into a campaign to see that persons, American citizens originally from Puerto Rico are given a -- every opportunity to vote and in the election of 1965, New York sent automobiles, trucks to the various areas where the Puerto Rican population was located in order to make it easier for these persons to come out and register, and as you've heard, actually their actually there only 8000 persons that took the opportunity under this 4 (e) to register for the 1965 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.247" offset="7548322">So far, there's been a great deal of discussion about the power of Congress to surround a certain group of the United States citizens with a protection which follows them wherever they may go and keeps them a separate and distinct class in any -- in any society in which they may live and I want to point out to you that the effect of the desired result sought by the appellant would be that there would be setup an enclave in the city such as New York where all the Puerto Ricans would read Puerto Rican newspapers, listen to Puerto Rican radio stations and television stations, read the literature in Puerto Rican and have no opportunity to integrate into society around them either in New York City or California whatever the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.580" offset="7817697">We have heard from the appellant in the Morgan case that Congress has done that by enacting Section 4 (e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and at the same time, we have heard from appellant in this case that the Congress did it long ago by treaty, by statute, by the United Nations' charter, and by the Constitution of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.561" offset="7913618">We submit that there is no substantial basis to any of the contentions the appellant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.852" offset="7938800">We submit further that something very important has been lost sight of along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.606" offset="7961788">We are not talking here about Puerto Rican citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.434" offset="7977148">We're talking about New Yorkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.978" offset="7991254">The Fourteenth Amendment defines state and national citizenship, all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of United States and of the state wherein they reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.018" offset="8071398">The appellant here is entitled to be treated like any other citizen of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.388" offset="8100968">New York cannot create a separate class of citizens based solely on the fact that citizenship was a crime in a place other than New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.941" offset="8155094">The very idea is repugnant to the basic ideas of our society and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment which says that a state shall not, “Deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.413" offset="8237014">Appellant's position throws into question the power of the state to set voting qualifications of its citizens and to have those qualifications apply equally to all its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.407" offset="8300962">Yet, the Constitution and the decisions of this Court have left that power beyond question so long as the qualification set by the State bear a reasonable relation to the exercise of the franchise and are not used to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.230" offset="8388315">This Court has held that literacy does indeed bear a reasonable relation to the exercise of the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.853" offset="8426768">This was held not only in the Lassiter case, but most recently in the Harper case, Mr. Justice Douglas referred to the same intelligent exercise with the franchise which is the basic foundation of literacy test in English.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.732" offset="8494268">Moreover, it cannot be denied that in times of New York and indeed of the Continental United States, literacy can realistically mean only English literacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.563" offset="8553618">New York has always contained the greatest diversity and language of any state and consequently, it's not pertinent for the appellant to suggest that the same problems may exist in some other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.747" offset="8638360">In New York, New York believes that one common language serves all the courtesies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.117" offset="8667826">The policy of one language has served New York well as it has served United States well, since English was required and is required as a prerequisite to naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.173" offset="8720071">Even today, in New York, there are many persons whose primary language is not English and it is not Spanish but the policy of one common language makes for integration and makes a workable community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.838" offset="8786735">English literacy is a reasonable qualification or exercise of the franchise in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.324" offset="8836681">The ballot itself demonstrates this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.906" offset="8850996">Each year, the ballot presents a long list of candidates and a wide range of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.653" offset="8886000">It is a primary concern that the voter have the ability to confront the ballot independently and that he had no need to rely on any person or group to act as an intermediary in confronting the ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.203" offset="8960188">It should be pointed out that the English literacy qualification in New York was initially proposed as an alternative to shorten the ballot and was -- the shortening the ballot and was not accepted by the voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.222" offset="9024240">There were some comments this morning by one of the appellants to the effect that -- in the newspapers -- in the Spanish newspapers, there was a printing of the ballot in Spanish and of the constitutional amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.554" offset="9109608">Now as far as our information is, we followed the Puerto Rican press, this was not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.891" offset="9142941">The Puerto Rican press is mainly concerned with discussion of life and events in Puerto Rico and another Spanish communities and little attention was given to general information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.649" offset="9209919">Supposing the President of United States makes a television address, he makes the address in English.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.314" offset="9248580">The -- not only the content of address -- of the address but the manner in which it is understood by the voter is very important in order to have an appreciation of the sense of the speech by the President or possibly by a candidate of President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.178" offset="9328097">The 1960 election turned on television with debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.946" offset="9351189">These debates are conducted in English.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.950" offset="9363205">This -- the voter whose knowledge would only be in Spanish would only get this permeated to him through the Spanish press and through the Spanish radio station or television.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.600" offset="9429765">To achieve an independent electorate, New York is interested only in an -- a minimal amount of English literacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.938" offset="9463097">No person is being required to abandon his reading of material in other languages or his use of another language as his primary medium of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.592" offset="9509700">No one is being asked only to acquire enough English to enable him if he chooses to participate as an individual in the business of governing the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.166" offset="9555989">Now in our brief, we have inserted comments from respectable persons and groups which demonstrate that the New York literacy test which is conduct at -- not by any political officials but by the Board of Regents of the State of New York, the Education Department, the English literacy test is a model and you have a copy, a sample copy of the English literacy test attached as an appendix in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.525" offset="10605484">It does not say in there that you then have to qualify by English literacy and that we have contacted the New York City Board of Elections and we find they have no experience of anybody who has registered under that provision without qualifying and passing a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.258" offset="10700361">Now as a matter of fact, in is much Mr. Chief Justice as you expressed interest in that point and the argument of my associate Mrs. Cone under the 4 (e) case, we have available, I'd like to make available to the Court in a further appendix, the form which is used by the Board of Elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.539" offset="10789491">Under this Section and you will see in there, there is a provision where the applicant must state whether he or she has a literacy certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.647" offset="10849991">So that there is no substantial basis to the argument that the State has done anything, but I think is the most laudable thing here as tried in every way possible to give everybody the opportunity to register and vote regardless of the fact that because of their domicile and because of disability they may be unable to either take the literacy test or by the same token may be unable to register because they are located somewhere outside their voting district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.091" offset="11003695">This is in the same line as I think the most frivolous objection that's been made by the appellant is that it's a badge of unconstitutionality for New York to provide that if you're disabled you can register and vote provided you -- the Board of Regents or the examiner is satisfied that but for the disability you would be entitled to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.287" offset="11120515">The same provision is contained in the Federal Naturalization Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2768.691" offset="11178088">In 1952, New York provided that anyone who's naturalized and therefore had to satisfy the federal authorities of the ability to read and write English, does not have to pass a literacy test as exempt for it and the ground for that thing that having already satisfied literacy requirements, it would be unnecessary for them to pass another examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.076" offset="13979669">Secondly, that the -- before this Court should uphold this extension of congressional power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court should be impressed with the fact that it was in the South Carolina case that there's a long history of frustration of judicial and administrative process to command respect for the dictates of the Fourteenth Amendment and this of course is wholly absent from this case and the only attempted evidence of that is to go back to 1920 -- 1915 to 1920 when the amendment was on the consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="3561.542" offset="14349563">In so consequently in order to arrive at the point where you feel that Congress is justified in the enactment of 4 (e) having first from to the conclusion that by virtue of the Grandfather Clause and the other provisions and the other arguments which are made that the law is unconstitutional in the first -- in the first place then this presents a basis for the -- for the establishment of the 4 (e) if the law at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.214" offset="14464188">But it would seem to me that they are intertwined to the point for a consideration of the first case must come after a full and complete consideration of the Cardona case.</text>
