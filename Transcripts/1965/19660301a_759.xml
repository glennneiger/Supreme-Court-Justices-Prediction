            <text syncTime="12.937" offset="157194">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.459" offset="171301">My name is Duane Nedrud, I'm counsel for the amicus, National District Attorneys Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.457" offset="191258">My co-counsel is Ms. Oberto.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.740" offset="200349">I thought that her presence might show that prosecuting attorneys are not all bad or she wouldn't be working for us in the full time basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.890" offset="248936">I may use some words of one of the justices of this Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.657" offset="268058">The Escobedo decision and the Dorado interpretation makes it more necessary than ever that we stop and look where we are going.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.398" offset="314974">If we are talking about equality between the rich and the poor, we are thriving for a worthy objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.888" offset="356979">If we are talking about equality between the policeman and the criminal, we are on dangerous ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.927" offset="397103">I would remind this Court that we are not talking about the police versus the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.044" offset="429599">We are talking about the people versus the defendant in any -- in the same way that we would not talk about the Army or the Marine Corps versus the Vietcong but we would talk about the United States versus the Vietcong.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.136" offset="493965">I have not mentioned in my brief anything about the Fifth or the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.196" offset="518207">I concede that this Court can interpret those Amendments in the way that it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.273" offset="554465">I am willing to agree with the ACLU in their brief in one point where they quote me although they do misquote me when they refer to Malloy and Haynes in substitution for -- on page 26 of their brief instead of Hailey and Payne whom I consider entirely different that in the admonishment in the Dorado interpretation will not affect materially confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.334" offset="670762">If this is to be our objective to limit the use of the confession in criminal cases then you are taking from the police the most important piece of evidence in every case that they bring before our court of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.199" offset="770236">Police officers are public servants.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.367" offset="790925">They are not attempting to put innocent people to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.711" offset="808270">They want to follow the dictates of this Court and they will follow them to the best of their ability but they too are human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.702" offset="848185">They do have, however, an experience and knowledge which many of us lack because this is their job in investigation of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.382" offset="886951">And we have not, as lawyers, paid attention to their problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.299" offset="918612">We have seldom bend on to the police station and asked what can we do to assist you in your problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.341" offset="954765">We are more inclined.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.958" offset="961243">And I talk about the prosecuting attorneys and I am not referring to this Court anymore than -- any other lawyer in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.797" offset="996561">In the case, if I may use the present case of Miranda as an example, the defense admits that there is a voluntary confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.981" offset="1041387">He says that we should not allow this confession because he did not have counsel present because we would not have been able to convict him because there was no other evidence except his own voluntary statement that his male organ had penetrated a half an inch, otherwise he would have been acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.877" offset="1124979">Is this what we are looking for to acquit Miranda because he did not have counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.732" offset="1164372">The amicus here as presented data covering thousands of man-hours on the part of the members attempting to show the widespread use of confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.477" offset="1223304">I am not saying that the widespread use of confessions justifies their use.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.800" offset="1244620">I am just attempting to present to you through our members the importance of the confession in our criminal administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.607" offset="1291849">I believe that there is something beyond that which we are discussing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.944" offset="1329152">I think that there is a need and I have mentioned this and I pray for it that all public servants, law enforcement officers and prosecuting attorneys, trial courts and members of this Court work together.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.141" offset="1401981">We are not adversaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.549" offset="1411594">There is a need I think on the part of the people to be able to refer to my policemen, my -- our police, my court and not those cops (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="374.427" offset="1603124">It's the system -- our system of justice in effect which we need as a matter of change.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.769" offset="1636456">I do not attempt to say that defense counsel is wrong when they attempt to do the best they can for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.256" offset="1666445">This is our system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.187" offset="1682119">But I could tell you for example in the State of New York that when a defense counsel is picked by those who are in the profession of criminal -- of crime, if I can use this, that they wonder who is hot for example in winning cases now and they are picked almost like whether -- as if they were race horses because now they are winning.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.954" offset="1793191">There is nothing so fickle as a criminal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.197" offset="1810223">He wants only one thing, he wants to win.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.129" offset="1825896">Now, if a prosecuting attorney only wants to win then we should not have that prosecuting attorney in office.</text>
