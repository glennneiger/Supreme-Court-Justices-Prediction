            <text syncTime="55.656" offset="325987">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.845" offset="338735">These three petitions arise from a single decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.137" offset="363917">That decision affirmed in an injunction entered in the Middle District of Florida, in action brought by the United States against the Florida East Coast Railway to enjoin what we allege to be violations of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.314" offset="416580">Eleven unions representing nonoperating employees of the Florida East Coast Railway intervened in the District Court in support of the injunction and participated in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.641" offset="465899">One of the petitions here has been filed by the United States, thats Number 782.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.821" offset="486693">One, taking essentially the same position has been filed by the unions, that's Number 750 and the third which is a cross petition has been filed by the carriers, that's Number 783.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.236" offset="532355">For purposes of the oral argument, I shall present the argument in chief for the position jointly taken by the unions and by the Unites States.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.770" offset="570493">Mr. Devaney will then argue for the carrier and Mr. Rutledge representing the unions will present a rebuttal argument for the position which the unions and the United States jointly take.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.215" offset="620231">The issue here essentially is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.168" offset="632038">The question is where and to what extent carriers covered by the Railway Labor Act must obey first their duty to bargain with the representatives of their employees and secondly, their duty to adhere to existing collective bargaining agreements which they have previously made with those representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.313" offset="712600">During the course of a lawful strike, the Unites States takes the position that both of those duties remain upon the carrier during the course of a lawful strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.520" offset="757426">It must both bargain with the representatives of its employees and it must adhere to collective bargaining agreements which continue to exist during the course of that strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.470" offset="797236">The carrier, on the other hand, takes the position that it is under neither those, that it must neither bargain nor adhere to existing collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.810" offset="838614">Let me briefly sketch to the Court the statutory scheme which maybe somewhat unfamiliar under which these issues arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.332" offset="872678">In the first place, like the National Labor Relations Act, the Railway Labor Act contains a general duty to bargain between employers and the representatives of their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.227" offset="912280">It goes a little bit further in general than the Railway -- than the National Labors Relations Act, however, in providing rather affirmatively that there's a duty of all carriers to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay rules and working conditions and to settle all disputes arising out of those agreements with the representatives of their employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.938" offset="1003081">There's nothing like that that explicit in the National Labors Relations Act about the duty to make and maintain agreements and of course a continuing duty to bargain with the representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.357" offset="1044773">Then the Act becomes much more explicit than the National Labors Relations Act and much more absolute in describing the meaning of the duty to bargain, “once agreements have been reached with the representatives of employees, as agreements had been reached in this case, first the Act provides that when either the carrier or the union wishes to change existing agreements covering rates of pay rules or working conditions notice must be served on the other party and negotiations between the parties undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.007" offset="1187401">If these negotiations fail to result in agreements either party may then invoke the services of the National Mediation Board which is created primarily for that purpose, to mediate disputes which haven't been settled by a negotiation or the Mediation Board may itself proffer its services even if the parties don't ask it to.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.853" offset="1262738">If this mediation fails, the Board, the Mediation Board, is then directed to encourage the parties to submit to the dispute to binding arbitration, although it can't compel the parties to do so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="301.754" offset="1310386">If one or both of the parties refuses arbitration and there's another step, the last resort you can create a presidential commission, an Emergency Board it's called, to recommend the solution to the dispute and again its recommendations aren't binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.094" offset="1371721">And --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="317.427" stopTime="319.206">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="317.427" offset="1373080">And the discretion of the president is not --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_bender" startTime="319.206" stopTime="558.454">
            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="319.206" offset="1380185">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.347" offset="1384782">I think the Mediation Board has some rule in making recommendations for the President but of course the President does not have to appoint the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.427" offset="1413099">In thus providing these detailed procedures which don't have any direct parallel in National Labors Relations Act, the Act provides as explicitly as one can imagine that existing conditions, those subject to the dispute, those that one party or the other wants to change must not be changed by the carrier while these negotiations, the mediation, the arbitration or if there's an Emergency Board, the Emergency Board is acting, while these procedures are in progress, you may not change the existing conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.744" offset="1538382">Then there's a general provision which again provides as explicitly as you can imagine, that you cannot make changes without entering into these statutory procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.618" offset="1577880">That provision, Section 2 Seventh of the Act, provides that unless the statutory from the negotiation procedures are undertaken, no carrier, its officers, agents or agent shall change the rates of pay, rules or working conditions of it's employees as a class as embodied in agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.807" offset="1650604">Thus, it seems to us quite clear and I don't think anyone disagrees with this, that the duty to bargain under the Railway Labor Act is defined in part and perhaps its most essential part, as the duty to adhere to existing collective bargaining agreements and not to change those agreements for employees as a class not the institute what would amount to amendments or changes without bargaining with the representatives of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.860" offset="1758856">At the same time as the carrier thus found there is a similar rule that applies to unions requiring the maintenance of existing agreements while these statutory procedures are in progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.445" offset="1805145">Thus, when a union for example is engaged in a wage dispute with a carrier, it may not strike on to and I think everyone agrees with this, although this is not as explicit in the Act, it may not strike until it has exhausted the statutory procedures just as the carrier may not unilaterally change the wages until it's exhausted the procedures are the carrier can engage in a lockout until the procedures have been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.075" offset="1895633">When the procedures are exhausted without a solution being reached, then and only then may the union strike to achieve its aims of proposal, and then and only then may the carrier implement the changes which it proposes without first exhausting the statutory procedures, both parties have to stand by existing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.156" offset="1972015">That's what the Act provides and I can imagine that it could do so anymore clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.531" offset="1989465">Now, it's -- as I said I think it's conceded that those provisions as I've described them are applicable in the ordinary situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.877" offset="2026872">The question here is, and also let me put that they are enforceable by injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.872" offset="2062817">I don't think there's any dispute about that any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.237" offset="2072325">There once was a question whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act might have prevented either of the parties from enjoining the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.652" offset="2093955">That is no longer a question seriously open to dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.612" offset="2109837">The question in this case is whether that statutory scheme as I described, it remains applicable during a lawful strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.249" offset="2144319">The carrier argues that those provisions do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.701" offset="2158216">In its view, when a strike occurs even though it's a lawful strike, it is entirely free, completely free to implement whatever wages, work rules or working conditions it desires for as long as the strike continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.819" offset="2218611">And that it doesn't have to bargain with the union about the implementation of any of those procedures either before the strike or during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.294" offset="2252570">As far as it's our concerned, the strike uses a complete freedom to treat its employees as it wishes so long as the strike continues and it carriers and I quote from it's brief, it says “It's agreements with the labor organizations were suspended during the period of the strike and FEC was not required even to attempt to comply with.”</text>

            <text syncTime="767.106" offset="3171767">But Mr. Justice Stewart, the union doesn't lose its status as bargaining representative simply because it goes out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.132" offset="3203950">That's not even true under the National Labors Relations Act and it's certainly isn't true under this Act where there's no provision provided for a union losing its representation without a new election, without a new representation proceeding being commenced and that has never happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.593" offset="3273749">Now, the Court of Appeals, in all of these, took a middle brown between these two positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.196" offset="3292139">It agreed with the United States that the carrier couldn't, as it still asserts it can do, completely ignores existing agreements and ignore the union because the union is out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.867" offset="3330800">The Court did however, purport to write a new gloss into the Act and it's a concededly new gloss that appears nowhere in the Act creating an exception to these broad prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.604" offset="3369775">The Court held that while a carrier can generally change its collective bargaining agreements during the strike, it can institute such changes in these agreements and -- as are and I quote again, “Reasonably necessary to effectuate its right to operate, to continue to run its railroad under strike conditions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="834.090" offset="3439783">Now, we think this gloss, this new exception while it's not as dangerous to collective bargaining and it's not -- well, it's not dangerous to collective bargaining as the rule of carriers -- it still terribly dangerous to bargaining and it's still contrary to the terms of the Act and we also believe that there's no cause for it's creation at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.188" offset="3536123">We're frankly concerned here to overturn this principle like you can violate collective bargaining agreements during a strike when it's necessary to operate rather than its application in this case, and let me be candid about that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.725" offset="3586278">The District Court in this case permitted only four changes under this exception and they were all relatively narrow minor changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.981" offset="3619297">If that were all that were going to happen under this exception, it wouldn't be dangerous, but as I will try to show later, we think its potentialities are much greater and there's a very good reason for getting rid of this now because the difficulties of reviewing these broad changes in the future when they're given in the form of temporary -- temporary release maybe in surmount of.</text>

            <text syncTime="1080.167" offset="4424077">Well, I suppose a common carrier with a certificate would have to attempt to operate under the Interstate Commerce Act but certainly if it was prevented from doing so by a strike because railroads generally are prevented from operating during a strike, there would be no violation of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.922" offset="4491055">And clearly I think that you can't read either of those duties as carte blanche just ignored other duties under the Railway Labor Act including the duty to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.803" offset="4534627">In the long run that sort of thing is much more detrimental to the passage of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.934" offset="4559078">The whole purpose of the Railway Labor Act was because labor disputes which were not settled amicably has been causing terrible disruptions to commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.985" offset="4595336">Now, if you say that you can forget about the amicable solution of labor disputes in order to permit carriers to operate that's going to boomerang and you will get -- and it's Congress' choice, it's not something I'm making off, I'm asking the Court to make up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.805" offset="4646640">That's the choice that Congress has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.546" offset="4653537">It seems to me clear that that's the choice of this Court has got to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.397" offset="4669001">Now, let me, although it comes rather late, let me go through these issues again fairly quickly in the context of the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.454" offset="4697213">They may become a bit clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.160" offset="4704005">In 1961, 11 nonoperating unions, those were the unions representing people who don't actually run the trains like clerks and machinists which had had collective bargaining agreements with all of the large railroads in the country for a number of years, served notice upon all these railroads including the Florida East Coast Railroad that they desired a 25 cent an hour wage increase and some, I think six months advance notice of job abolitions and layoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.519" offset="4809435">The carriers, bargaining as a group, proposed wage decreases and notice of abolitions of only 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.501" offset="4845380">This dispute as to whether wages should go up or down or what the notice should be for employees, it was a dispute subject to the -- to the negotiation and mediation procedures which I described before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.596" offset="4901804">Thus, the carrier couldn't implement their proposals nor could the union strike to implement its proposals until the whole bargaining procedure was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.744" offset="4934301">Over the course of the next nine months, all the acts of bargaining procedures were entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.132" offset="4955930">Negotiation and mediation failed with regard to this dispute, but then the presidential board was appointed and the presidential board recommended a solution of a 10 cent an hour wage increase and 5 days notice of job abolitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.630" offset="5009847">In June 1962 this settlement was accepted by every Class I railroad in the country except the carrier in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.239" offset="5044328">Florida East Coast Railroad was the only railroad of its class, those are the large railroads, not to accept the presidential board's recommended solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.717" offset="5082258">After they did that, the mediation board attempted further to mediate the dispute which was now a dispute simply between the FEC and these unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.694" offset="5118098">This mediation was unsuccessful and the board was unsuccessful in getting the parties to agree to the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.486" offset="5141295">At the beginning of both parties refused the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.893" offset="5150908">Later on, the union when requested again by I think the Secretary of the Labor agreed to arbitration and as it now stands, the union will agree to arbitrate the carriers will not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.578" offset="5197720">Thus, you have an impasse reach with Florida East Coast and these unions about this wage dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.811" offset="5222588">Then the dispute reaches the point where a strike becomes lawful where you can use self-help in these Court's work The union can go out on strike to enforce its demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.944" offset="5263130">The carrier can implement its demands if it wants because they've gone through all the statutory negotiation procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.717" offset="5294268">In January 1963, such a strike began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.081" offset="5307747">Now, I emphasize again, this strike was entirely lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.146" offset="5323943">It occurred only after the union had in good faith attempted to bargain with the employer about the requests it made and about the proposals that the carrier made, which as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out before it limited to this wage dispute and this notice of dispute, how much notice you need for job abolition?</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.480" offset="5405341">At the beginning the strike was apparently effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.403" offset="5416939">The other employees refused to cross the picket line and the railroad shut down for about a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.112" offset="5443793">The strike however didn't result as apparently most railroad strikes do result in a fairly quick settlement of the dispute and the railroad decided to attempt to operate despite the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.843" offset="5482768">As I say again, it had a perfect right to attempt to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.223" offset="5500217">The question is whether in attempting to do it, it did it consistently with it's obligations on the Railway Labor Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2001.042" offset="8107551">The carriers said you can't do that because the unions forfeited its right to mediate or to engage in any of the other statutory procedures because it walk out on that meeting because of the Court reporter and the Mediation Board said “That was not a refusal to bargain because you had not right to bargain with the court report.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.091" offset="8171708">The carrier ignored that -- ignored the fact that the Mediation Board has docketed the dispute and went right ahead and permanently instituted these changes which it had sought to bargain about and which the Mediation Board still wanted it to bargain about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.918" offset="8227088">It was at this stage that the United States initiated the present litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.072" offset="8243702">In our view by permanently implementing this working agreement proposal, despite the Mediation Board's decision to docket the dispute, to carrier is directly violating Act and it's completely undercutting the Board's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.935" offset="8295111">The Board believes and we thought correctly the meaningful mediation that carriers' proposals would be entirely frustrated by the carriers having already implemented those proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.434" offset="8333145">In addition, the previous action of the carrier and just acting unilaterally with regard to its employees was in our view completely, a flagrant violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.907" offset="8379016">To our knowledge, no carrier previously had ever contended that it could do such a thing and we thought it was important to vindicate the Act in the face of these action as means of maintaining good faith bargaining in our labor industry and we would -- normally we are mindful in doing this that the railroad involves survival defense installations of Cape of Kennedy and surrounding areas and that prolongation or intensification of this dispute might very well have consequences, adverse consequences on the Government's programs there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.308" offset="8492596">Plus it's also a standing in this action the practical standing close from the considerations that I've just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.708" offset="8518196">The legal basis for the standing I think that flow from those directly with -- it's not necessary in any event because Section 2 Tenth of the Act, it seems to us clearly, gives the United States standing to initiate an action such as this and that's what we've got.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.428" offset="9385044">We will deal with our employees however we want” and they can go further as the carrier went in this case, they can propose once they've got these changes instituted, they can propose to keep them there permanently and file this Section 6 notices to permanently change throw out all the collective bargaining agreements and to run the shop on their own terms and again, they sit back.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.658" offset="12713984">It never attempted to comply with it and their position in this Court is just that and boldly that because they don't have to make any attempt to comply with their agreements during a strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="3362.227" offset="13552306">That's all we have insisted that we have the right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.634" offset="13565889">And when the strike began we had absolutely no employees, but supervisors and when we operated the first train on February the 3rd, we used supervisors because this was the only way we could operate and in using the supervisors we clearly crossed every craft line imaginable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.726" offset="13658258">We had to run them through terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.024" offset="13667453">We have to have them do the yard work, local freight work, inspect their own locomotives, they fueled their own diesels, they did everything that was required to be done, because there was not anybody else who could do this work for the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.179" offset="13756061">As we began to hire replacements, in the first place when it wasn't hired until more than a month after we ran the first train, it was in April and we hired one man in April.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.210" offset="13812172">Now, with one man we have to use his skills and ability to do whatever he could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.136" offset="13835891">It is conceded all the way through that we could not hire qualified employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.488" offset="13861282">They were basically unqualified and we have to train them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.511" offset="13877373">It was earlier asked about training time well, in shop class alone, there is a four-year apprenticeship program which is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.723" offset="13910288">We couldn't get the journeymen and to train these people under the agreements themselves would take a period of four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.143" offset="13943933">So we have no alternative but to hire people with as much skill as we could find and we have to use those skills the best way we could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.755" offset="13982386">And if the men were not fully qualified to perform the work of machinist, he had to do whatever part of that job he could do and we have something else that somebody else could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.743" offset="14026376">We have to use another person to try and fill in and do the job and to keep the railroad operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.659" offset="14058036">That's what we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.509" offset="14065455">It was asked earlier to what we do about payment well, there's no question about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.074" offset="14087711">When the strike replacement problem first came up in April, the only way we could get replacements was to pay them on a salary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.453" offset="14133164">I think it's perfectly understandable why they might have wanted a salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.454" offset="14149151">They didn't know and the railroad didn't know whether we could operate this railroad one day or two days or a week or whether it would be successful but he wanted a salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.005" offset="14191365">The record shows that we took the hourly rates in the contract, we converted them to a salary, that's what we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.024" offset="14223444">In addition to that we did because of severe shortage of clerical employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.934" offset="14247058">We did take the holiday pay provisions and included that in these base rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.627" offset="14277883">Every one of the agreements had a different eligibility provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.336" offset="14296691">And we just didn't have the personnel to keep all the records required so we put it all into the base rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.224" offset="14328247">Now, except for those changes, this is what the people were paying and as early as April, when we were beginning to get a few more replacement employees, we started moving back to the hourly base, the hourly rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.957" offset="14387179">Now what we have to do, and we don't deny, it is perfectly clear in the record that we had no choice but to use the people to perform whatever job they could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.998" offset="14439320">You didn't have journeyman machinist, you didn't have journeyman electricians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.984" offset="14459277">And if we had a man who had been an automobile mechanic, he'd done some welding before he might be working for us as an electrician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.046" offset="14491564">But if we needed the welding, we have to use that man to do the welding if he was the only person available to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.787" offset="14514552">This is what we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.797" offset="14522598">This is what we say we have a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.607" offset="14533778">We say this is what self-help means and that is what this case was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.787" offset="14562513">Really, the issue is, as Mr. Bender has stated, it's a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.636" offset="14589889">It's whether a rail or an air carrier has the right to try to operate in the face of a strike with whatever personnel it has available and it is our position that a carrier does have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.806" offset="14650598">We say that this is precisely what self-help means.</text>

            <text syncTime="5470.564" offset="21985677">In the American case, it differed a little bit because the pilots and the flight engineers on American got together and they signed or issued an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.851" offset="22034787">Then it was the pilot's international union that it refused to approve this agreement that the American pilots had negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.423" offset="22081076">So, the -- the local pilots on American when the international refused to go along with the package they had bargained sought separate representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.833" offset="22158712">Well at this point, the flight engineers asked to continue bargaining with the American.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.498" offset="22189328">And American said, “No, you have signed this agreement and have initialed it merging your bargaining rights in with the pilots.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.503" offset="22225377">Second Circuit said “No, there's no strike here and American must continue to recognize and bargain with the flight engineers until there is a final consummation and a final change that changes or wipes out the bargaining rights with the flight engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.289" offset="22308551">So that there is no doubt in our judgment, look at the Court cases, look at the decisions of the adjustment board itself, the adjustment board has said over and over again that when a strike occurs it creates an emergency condition that justifies the carrier in performing the work with supervisors or in whatever way it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.587" offset="22405726">We say that -- we believe the strike on Florida East Coast have that effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="5981.070" offset="24027617">Now, this was unusual in one respect in that there had been an initial strike date set and in anticipation of this original strike date, the President of the United States seized all of the railroads in the country under a statute which was then in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="6493.840" offset="26078751">Now, we say that the -- we believe that the Court of Appeals in the Trainmen case because the same issue was raised there and when the Court of Appeals said that the corollary to the right of the union to strike was we had the right to operate and we have -- it was not a violation to hire replacements, so we had no duty to discharge unless or until membership that was offered to them without discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6524.277" offset="26200482">We said to the District Court that we think the Court of Appeals meant that if these people were being discriminated against that they shouldn't be subject to discharge until membership was offered to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.264" offset="26252413">The District Court did not agree with this and it did not contain this provision and to that extent you are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6546.240" offset="26288358">We did take the position that if these people have to be subject to the union shop agreement that it should be subject to the union making membership available and if it isn't willing to do that, then the agreement as to that should not be enforceable during the period of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.888" offset="26362964">Now if I may refer to one last matter which the unions have raised, it is this question of the Toledo, P. &amp; W.R. and Eastern case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6573.662" offset="26398072">Now, we believe that this has no application for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.518" offset="26417403">To begin with we have not asked for any equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6582.006" offset="26431404">It's our position that the right of self-help is a legal right that this all we have asked for as all we feel we're entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6591.697" offset="26470170">But second, the Toledo, P &amp; W.R. case itself makes it perfectly clear that the Court in that decision was confronted with a situation where the carrier had refused arbitration prior to the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="6606.549" offset="26529520">Now, the exchange of correspondence is set forth in Appendix A of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.378" offset="26556897">It clearly shows that Florida East Coast before the strike simply said that we believe your offer of arbitration is premature that there should be further mediation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6625.159" offset="26604022">The union came back and said, “We don't -- we reject the suggestion of mediation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6630.724" offset="26626278">We reject arbitration.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6632.664" offset="26634010">At that point, the Board listened to the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6635.664" offset="26646026">Later Florida East Coast even said, “Well -- to the Mediation Board, we believe that there should be an emergency already created.</text>
            <text syncTime="6643.417" offset="26677060">There was no such recommendation and the strike began.</text>
            <text syncTime="6646.432" offset="26689076">Now, Toledo says, as I read the case clearly and without any provocation that it applies only where the procedures of Railway Labor Act including the proffer of arbitration has been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="6660.294" offset="26744560">There was no rejection prior to the strike which are the procedures of Railway Labor Act by the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6667.560" offset="26773608">It was a rejection by the unions of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="6671.238" offset="26788342">We do not believe that the offer of Secretary of Labor were some four months after the strike began to help -- to bring about a settlement means that even if equitable relief were asked for that the refusal four months after the strike had began and after we got back into operation it meant that we have not made use of the procedures of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6699.010" offset="26899414">So that we say that the -- that the argument really has no application to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.372" offset="26924910">We believe that -- that however it's construed that it would not be applicable by way of limitation on anything that Florida East Coast has done.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="6718.892" offset="26978931">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6722.374" offset="26992828">I believe I have about nine or ten minutes left and I understood under the arrangement that we had that the rebuttal would be 15, I will try to compress it within the time left so I will move fairly fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6737.142" offset="27051969">I think that at this time of the oral argument, the point that we would like to address ourselves to right at the initial outset is where what has been conceded by both sides does the exception to the Railway Labor Act spring from.</text>
            <text syncTime="6756.540" offset="27129501">Where did the Court of Appeals find the basis for creating the doctrine which is under review here, the so-called doctrine of reasonably necessary exceptions to the Railway Labor Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="6769.663" offset="27182059">I think everybody concedes the FEC, the Association of American Railroads, the Government and the unions, that what was done here by the FEC could not have been done but for strike conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6783.018" offset="27235453">And the plain categorical language of Section 2 Seventh of the Railway Labor Act makes this clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6789.615" offset="27261785">And I would like to refer to that, it hasn't been mentioned in so many words and it's very short and it's very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6795.906" offset="27286967">And it says “No carrier, its officers or agents shall change the rates of pay, rules or working conditions of each employees as a class as embodied in agreement except in the manner prescribed in such agreements or in Section 156 namely Section 6 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6815.877" offset="27366902">Now, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had said that doesn't apply because of strike conditions because it bears too heavily, too hard on the railroad under strike conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.830" offset="27418728">The Court of Appeals does not refer to any language in the Act to support this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.228" offset="27440253">The Court of Appeals does not refer to any legislative history to support this exception and we submit that the mere fact that it is contended that it bears too heavily on the carrier faced with the strike conditions is not in law sufficient to create the exception here found to exist by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6857.471" offset="27533249">Now, there are three basic positions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6862.126" offset="27551848">One position is that the Act applies under strike conditions just as it applies when there are no strike conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.754" offset="27582360">That is the Government's position, that is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6873.801" offset="27598555">The other position is the position of the American Association of Railroads and the FEC that under strike conditions even though it may be with just one union this gives the railroad the legal right as Mr. Devaney referred to it to totally suspend all of its contracts with all of its crafts, in this case there are 21 different crafts, 21 different contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6899.722" offset="27702209">That is the counter position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6902.043" offset="27711509">In between the Court of Appeals who said “No, you cannot totally suspend the provisions of the Act, but we will permit an application, the railroad to come in, in the nature of equitable relief and seek certain limited exceptions where it makes a showing that it is reasonably necessary for the railroad to do so in order to operate under strike conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6927.227" offset="27812237">We say the Court of Appeals decision is wrong because it spins out of the whole clock an exception into the Railway Labor Act which readjusts the economic balance struck by that Act by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6940.314" offset="27864586">We say that the position of the railroad is wrong because it is far more extreme and even the limited exception or gloss put on the Act by the Court of Appeals and because the only actions of the railroad in this case shows that there has never been an understanding either in the industry or by this particular carrier that contracts are totally suspended under strike conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.454" offset="27969181">Three concessions have been made by counsel for the railroad in this case which are totally inconsistent with any idea of contracts or the Act being suspended during a strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="6979.798" offset="28022575">How can they earn seniority if the contracts are suspended?</text>
            <text syncTime="6982.973" offset="28035218">One is the grievances maybe processed during the strike as they are being done on the property today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6988.378" offset="28056848">How can you have grievances if the Act or the contracts are totally suspended?</text>
            <text syncTime="6994.127" offset="28079835">The third is, if the union is the representative of the replacements -- well, how can that be if the Act or the contracts are suspended?</text>
            <text syncTime="7004.443" offset="28121109">And we would like to point to something which we think is even more clearly about what the understanding of this particular carrier and the railroad industry is generally and that is the Section 6 proposals involved in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7018.348" offset="28176802">The proposals made by the carrier in September of 1963, eight or nine months after this strike began and I would like to refer to page 44 of the Exhibit record where one of those Section 6 notices is set forth, and page 254 -- excuse me, page 416 of the Exhibit record where another of those Section 6 proposals is set forth and this is what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="7047.196" offset="28292159">They say “Article 3, “We propose a bargain with you about putting in to our collective bargaining contract Article 3 entitled work stoppages.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7056.729" offset="28330297">And then it goes on and there's a full paragraph here in which it sets out contract provisions that would govern during work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="7064.221" offset="28360286">Now, how is this consistent with any idea that the contracts or the Act are totally suspended under the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="7073.109" offset="28395813">We submit Your Honor that the whole process of the Railway Labor Act, the whole scheme of it is to take disputes and narrowly confine and refine and define them to the point where they become confined rather than expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="7092.427" offset="28473031">This dispute started out as a very simple wage dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7096.769" offset="28490480">It got down to the point where the difference between the parties was only 10 cents an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="7100.969" offset="28507199">It now involves literally every single rule, rate of pay, and working condition in 21 different contracts on the entire property.</text>

            <text syncTime="7124.161" offset="28599986">That's correct Your Honor, but what they did here and what the record shows they did, they put in these conditions of employment the so-called strike imposed conditions of employment, they said they were only to be temporary but actually what they did, they put those in, they codified them and written for them on September 1, three weeks later, September 24 -- September 25, they issued Section 6 notices which are substantially the same saying “We want this as the permanent change.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7149.650" offset="28701968">In other words, what has happened here is that the whole issue has expanded to the point where the mediators involved, labor department throw up their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="7160.724" offset="28746271">I think that's the reason the Government is in this suit is because the whole process of mediation of existing disputes once a strike exists is completely frustrated both by the doctrine of the Court of Appeals and by the doctrine asserted by the carriers in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="7210.058" offset="28943653">Eastern Airlines never attempted to operate contrary to an existing contract.</text>
