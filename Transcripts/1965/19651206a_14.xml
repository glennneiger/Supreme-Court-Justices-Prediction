            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="47.759" offset="294431">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.268" offset="308433">This case began with an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission which did only one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.763" offset="334451">It ordered the respondent railroads, pay reparations of about $8900 to a shipper, Thomson Phosphate Company, based upon shipments of ground phosphate rock from Florida points at -- in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.440" offset="405086">This Court granted the Commission's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the respondent railroads could bring suit, seeking review of the Commission's reparation order under the statutory provisions governing the review of Commission orders generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.422" offset="493066">We contend that contrary to the court below that the railroads may not bring suit to challenge a Commission order awarding reparation, but that they may attack that order only by way of defense to the Commi -- to the shipper's suit seeking to enforce the reparation order under the provisions of Section 16, paragraph 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.364" offset="600795">We contend that only in this way can there be effectuated two congressional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.916" offset="630993">First, to leave to the shippers rather than to the Government, the enforcement of reparation orders and secondly, to accord to the shippers' specific procedural rights as to venue cost and attorney's fees which will enable shippers to assume that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.670" offset="710092">The railroad brought this suit in 1961 in the United States' District Court for the Middle District of Florida, naming United States and the Commission as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.685" offset="758157">The shipper was not named as a defendant and has not intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.339" offset="784697">The railroads brought this suit in Florida in reliance upon three statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.577" offset="805700">The first was Section 17, paragraph 9 of the Interstate Commerce Act which is set forth in our brief at page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.469" offset="841226">We submit that on its face, 17 (9) is simply a requirement for the exhaustion of administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.680" offset="874141">The railroad contend that 17 (9) refers us to the Judicial Code, Section 1336, that's in our brief at page 2, which provides that except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress, the District Court shall have jurisdiction of any civil action to enforce, enjoin, set aside any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.391" offset="976959">The railroad further point to the venue provision 1398 of the Judicial Code, which provides that such an action shall be brought only in the judicial district wherein is the residence or office of plaintiff or one of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.160" offset="1035995">So the railroad contended in this case that under Section 1336, they could bring their own direct action in the District Court for review of the Commission's reparation order and that under the general venue provision of 1398, they could bring it in Jacksonville, Florida where the Atlantic Coast Line, a respondent here and a plaintiff below, has its principle place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.902" offset="1134947">Now, we admit that 1336 and 1398 of the Judicial Code, provide for the judicial review of the general wrong of ICC orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.771" offset="1186461">However, we contend that they are -- those two sections are rendered inapplicable by the specific provisions of Section 16, paragraph 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act as to what shall happen when the Commission directs railroads to pay reparations to a shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.427" offset="1273083">Before getting into the heart of the problem, I can refer briefly to the prior Court decisions on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.312" offset="1304639">This Court has never given plenary consideration to the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.642" offset="1321984">In 1911, in Southern Railway Company v. United States, the former Commerce Court of United States held on a literal reading of its jurisdiction to review any order of the Commission that it could entertain such a suit by a railroad at attacking a reparation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.803" offset="1406621">That case has not been cited since 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.637" offset="1425951">Later in 1924, a three-judge district court and in 1937 the Third Circuit, have held that a railroad may not maintain such a direct suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.196" offset="1476106">I might also say that a mere glance at the annotations to Section 16 (2) of the Annotation Code, shows that there are large number of cases in which the courts have look up reparation orders in the context of a suit brought by the shipper under 16 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="360.186" offset="1544129">For 50 years, except for three -- of three cases in which I have mentioned before and this case, for 50 years, the courts have reviewed reparation orders in the context of a suit brought by the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.640" offset="1605883">Before going into the details of Section 16 (2), I think it may be useful to point out the Court the status of a reparation order issued by the Commission as compared to the other types of orders, many other types of orders which the Commission issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.139" offset="1671920">Since the Hepburn amendments of 1906, with the exception of orders for the payment of money, the Commission's orders are self-executing, self-operating, in that they must be obeyed subject to penalty unless a court sets them aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.509" offset="1753422">And it was -- in making orders – such orders other than for the payment of money, self-operative for the first time in 1906 that Congress for the first time provided for direct review of Commission orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.782" offset="1810474">In addition, if a railroad fails to obey any order of the Commission other than for the payment of money, the Commission or any party injured may go into court and seek affirmative enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.255" offset="1872436">In contrast, when the Commission orders a railroad to pay reparations to a shipper, that is an order for the payment of money, that order is not self-operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.033" offset="1923532">By that I mean, that if the railroad is unwilling to comply and pay, nothing happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.255" offset="1944430">It is not subject to any penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.883" offset="1954879">Moreover, the Commission is not empowered to go into court to enforce a reparation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.333" offset="1984658">Rather Section 16 (2) has its own specific machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.779" offset="2006497">It's set forth in pages 4 and 5 of our brief and it provides that the complainant, that is the shipper, may file in the District Court of United States for the District in which he resides, on which is located the railroad's office or through which the railroad operates or in any state court which has jurisdiction of the railroad, a complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="758.853" offset="3138748">We think Section 16 (2) has four salient features.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.624" offset="3157870">The First it provides that the Commission order awarding reparations shall be enforced by the shipper not by Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.504" offset="3189426">It gives the shipper a choice of venue, including most importantly the District in which he resides.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.280" offset="3248462">We believe this whole procedure, careful procedural pattern of 16 (2) were before him, if it's the court below held the carrier instead of waiting for the shipper's suit which must be brought within a year, instead of winning for the shipper's suit, it instituted its own direct review proceeding in a suit brought against the United States and the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="832.417" offset="3432991">That suit is being held in the abeyance on this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.066" offset="3451591">The respondent railroad contend that the provisions of 17 (9) of the Interstate Commerce Act and 1336 of the Code in authorizing actions to enjoin any order of Commission must be read as including all orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.860" offset="3526823">Now, we -- we point out that this Court in a series of cases, Los Angeles Railroad, Griffin has held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.296" offset="3572590">In Waterman for example, these cases were -- were summarized briefly by this Court as follows and I quote, “this Court long has held that statutes which employ broad terms, to confer power of judicial review are not always to be read literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.433" offset="3633089">Rather this Court has held that the meaning of a statutory provision for review of any order must be read and must be found in the context of a statute about.”</text>
            <text syncTime="893.935" offset="3679065">And so, we say that this Court is wholly free as a matter of statutory construction to hold that a railroad may attack a reparation order only by way of defense to a shipper's suit under 16 (2) in order to carry out the legislative policies underlying 16 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="913.055" offset="3755551">Next the railroads contend that they should not be relegated to defense in a 16 (2) suit because they say 16 (2) is not a review provision and they seem to say that the District Court in a 16 (2) suit brought by the shipper would not have power to review the Commission's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.313" offset="3848652">We think this Court has clearly held of the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.673" offset="3862026">In 1915 in Meeker case, this Court held that Section 16 (2), cuts off no defense, interposes no obstacle to a full contestation of all the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.457" offset="3909151">And in 1949 in U.S. v. ICC this Court referred as guaranteeing railroads a complete judicial review of adverse reparation orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.766" offset="3966412">So we submit that there would no unfairness in relegating the railroads to the remedy of defending against the reparation order by way of defense to the shipper's 16 (2) suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.535" offset="7597537">Mr. Chief Justice, members of this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.019" offset="7619480">I think if I may I would like to state at the very outset that my answers to most of the questions addressed to Mr. Ginnane with the possible exception of those posed by Mr. Chief Justice -- Mr. Justice White would have been exactly the reverse to the answers he gave this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.749" offset="7694399">For example, before I attempt to deal with my prepared argument, it's my understanding that the law is entirely clear in response to the first question that Mr. Justice Harlan asked that the Court could not change the amount of damages which the Commission had found a particular complainant to -- entitled to in a Section 1 case, a Section which alleged that the charges under attack were unjust and unreasonable in violation to that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.292" offset="7836505">As a matter of fact, this Court itself and I don't have immediate reference to it but it's the brief, this Court itself has said in the case of that kind and incidentally, the case that precipitated this particular proceeding before this Court is what -- is the Section 1 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.358" offset="7908812">This Court has said that the amount damages, is in effect fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.472" offset="7929292">It's the difference between the rate originally charged which is a sale before the Commission as unreasonable and the Commiss -- and the rate which the Commission decides would have been a reasonable rate and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.061" offset="7975581">In other words, if the sale rate for 50 cents, and the Commission says, a reasonable rate would have been 40 cents, the damages are fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.496" offset="8013406">There 10 cents per 100 pounds times the weight of the shipment and there's nothing for the court to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.500" offset="8041409">Now in Section 3 case, where the allegations before the Commission turn on a finding of undue preference and undue prejudice and there which is extremely rare incidentally, there the Commission decides that the complainant is entitled to damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.385" offset="8120926">The amount of damages there determines as I read the cases can be looked at by the -- by the court because there the damages go beyond the measure of the rates charged for transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.149" offset="8183933">There the Court is entitled to look, to see whether or not the plaintiff has been made whole for his total damages which is not the case in a Section 1 proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.105" offset="10231829">I've said and we have said in substance in our brief and I'm sure I don't have to repeat it here that Section 16 (2) is not a review section as Mr. Ginnane has indicated with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.130" offset="10275924">And this Court has said in the substances as has others that it's an action sounding in tort for damages and that it's a civil action that can be brought only by the party claiming damage or injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.147" offset="10336005">Its nowhere the accident and I'm sure it isn't for the reason of Mr. Ginnane said that the Commission wasn't empower to enforce the reparation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.022" offset="10375502">It is because it involved the taking of money which -- in which they had no direct interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.256" offset="10396400">Anybody entitled to damages from a railroad who is charge to unlawful rate would be the plaintiff in the case and they have referred or left rather to the -- to their right to seek seek damages they would as this Court has said in any of the civil action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.116" offset="10463796">Now, 1336 the section of the judicial review statute that gives the carriers the right -- gives anybody a right to seek, to enjoin set aside then no an Commission order is a so-called direct review section.</text>

            <text syncTime="2614.448" offset="10561181">So let me say that -- I put this way, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.126" offset="10575914">In two decisions at least by this Court, United States against ICC and Pennsylvania against United States, the opinions in which were both written by Mr. Justice Black, it seems to me that there's no question whatever that this Court has in all and every -- in practical results taken the position already that suits to it maybe brought to enjoin any order for the requirement of the Commission and not as they say any order except one requiring the payment of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.653" offset="10713945">Now, the late Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the first case, United States against the ICC reported at 337 U.S. in a -- in a dissent that if I recall correctly was longer rather than the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.430" offset="10765040">Trying to read into the statute, into the Section 16 (2) the very language that Mr. Ginnane contends for all practical purposes is there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2682.659" offset="10834004">Any order or requirement other than one for the payment of money, but the Court obviously didn't listen to it then and I know of no reason why I should listen to him now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2727.901" offset="11014980">And incidentally as I mention in that brief, right now we have an action similar to this pending in the District Court in Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.975" offset="11051238">If my memory serves me correctly, it's been there over two years now, waiting the disposition of this jurisdictional issue, involving some 16 or 18 complainants -- plaintiffs before the -- complainants before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.343" offset="11112782">In a few instances, two have intervened in the proceeding and filed a counter claim, seeking damages and an award of attorney's fees and costs and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.082" offset="11171715">I think that's entirely proper but the important thing about the disposition that we're trying to make indicates of that time where the plaintiff as if they become, excuse me, where the complainants before the Commission were all the way from California to Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.855" offset="11242768">I'm sure that the figures are minimum of 16 and I recall a republic steel company in Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.627" offset="11261889">I recall somebody else in San Francisco, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.555" offset="11281638">Now apart from those 16 or 18, the entitlement to bring suits that are in any time in the course of the first year to enforce the order there, other people unrelated to the action who had similar transportation services performed with them on the strength for the reparation of the administrative findings and order which we are there seeking review of, could go into any State Court or any Federal District Court and ask for damages on the strength to those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.357" offset="11400756">Now, the action that we're attempting to take is to clear the air promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.681" offset="11422072">If we don't do that we got to sit by and wait for the expiration of 12 months to see if any body is going to sue us if we don't comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.791" offset="11462510">Perhaps even more important in that ethically is no other way, this statute, the Interstate Commerce Act makes it a duty of carriers to comply with any order of the Commission as long it is on the book so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.907" offset="11519039">And while as my friend says there's no “penalty” as there is, if you fail to comply with an order, “telling you to publish a rate for the future to take effect one month from today when you can be subject to a $5,000 fine, there are penalties here as the law or the Court find it out and the -- as this Court has said itself in the Baldwin case which is likewise been shown in -- decided in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.470" offset="11629275">The purpose of 16 (2), according to this Court was not to place the burden of enforcement as Mr. Ginnane puts it on the complainant for the reasons I have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.401" offset="11688939">The Commission itself couldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.112" offset="11695835">In any other respect or any other case, they have the right under Section 16 (12) to go into court and so do other people as well to compel enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.471" offset="11733243">In the case of a suit for money, that's left to the private parties, but the -- I forgot what I'm trying to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.068" offset="11787682">In any event the point of it here is, we would be, I started to say about the Baldwin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.098" offset="11807744">In the Baldwin case, this -- this Court said in the substance that the reason for 16 (2) was to preclude reluctant railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.699" offset="11846196">I don't know if they use the term reluctant or not, but they certainly used terms like coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.033" offset="11871483">They wanted to keep railroads from offering, harassing resistance to comply with these orders when they didn't have a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.935" offset="11903143">Now, we are not here because we didn't think we had a defense to these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.193" offset="11916100">We think quite -- quite to the contrary and that's the reason we probably would has a good offense and undertook the pursue it and I'm not at all impressed by Mr. Ginnane's continued repetition about it here and in the brief but this is the first time in 50 years that somebody has thought of seeking judicial review directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.468" offset="11997288">Maybe there were another case as I'm -- I'd be the first to say that in the -- I would think in the large of jar of instances where that railroads defend reparation cases before the Commission and lose they comply with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.180" offset="12068133">They pay Comm -- they pay the amount specified in the Commission's order with interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.259" offset="12084433">It's only an extreme cases whereas in this one in the Baltimore one that I've talked about where they're satisfied and would believe in their minds that they have a good reason to challenge the validity of the of the Commission's administrative findings and order as a matter of law that they do what they did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.508" offset="12165413">And again, that doesn't deprive any shipper of a choice of venue or attorney's fees or anything else if he chooses to protect themselves, but he doesn't even have to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.376" offset="12208880">But the lower court commented on that too and pointed out that as practical matters, if we have a direct review proceeding and lose, the complainant before the Commission is almost home free so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.078" offset="12275649">There's no defense left then in the Section 16 (2) and contrary to the position taken by the Government, I can't imagine any single instance in which railroads, who lost the direct review proceeding brought under Section 17 (9) or 1336, not to mention the Administrative Procedure Act, incidentally, would even bother trying further to contest the validity of that action or require any complainant -- any complainant to become a plaintiff in a Section 16 (2) suit to get the reparation that then I don't think any defense to which it is simple as that to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.078" offset="12431653">Now, the -- another thing that I think this Court should know is that in the cases that I referred to already which the opinions are written by Mr. Justice Black, the United States took a position directly opposite that which the United States and the Commission combined are attempting to turn it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.471" offset="12529246">In those cases, they in effect said and I pointed this out in my brief as I recall correctly at page 19 and begin around 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.518" offset="12609494">In those cases, the United States took the position in substance that this language of the statute was clear and that there was no doubt at all that any order meant any order and that any party could attack him in a Section 1336 suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.874" offset="12686817">Now in its brief, the -- and particularly in its reply brief as I recall correctly or if it is not there incidentally, it is in the Government's brief in the case following this immediately, the Consolo case which was not consultative for oral argument by this Court but in the in its -- in its brief -- I'm sorry, I've lost my thought and I'm trying to find a place it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.439" offset="12865076">Oh, in its brief, they -- now, I have lost my thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.205" offset="12908231">Finally -- finally, the Court -- I'm sorry the Government in its – argument here says in substance that the fact that there's slight difference that they talk about in a Section 16 (2) suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.026" offset="12991509">He can get the administrative findings and order set aside and the other when you can is from that standpoint doesn't mean anything that we have no cause to compliant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.332" offset="13036648">Oh, I say with that's all -- that's all the cause in the world we need to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.957" offset="13051173">What they may think is minor in some instances maybe major from our standpoint – One thing more; Mr. Ginnane referred to a case that was before the courts in the 1913, if I recall correctly the so called Southern Railway case and mentioned the fact that nothing came of that because of the complaint was withdrawn and it couldn't be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.904" offset="13227029">I think the Court should know that the decision in that case, it wasn't written by was at least joined in by Judge Knapp who had been challenging the Interstate Commerce Commission for some 12 or 14 years, prior to his appointment to the bench and as such he appeared as a witness before Congress on a number of occasions when revisions of the Act where under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.291" offset="13356492">He certainly, if anybody was, was thoroughly familiar with the meaning of the phrase “Any order or requirement” at the time the decision in the Southern Case was laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.926" offset="13411035">And that -- that one important in that it was referred to in a St Louis versus Ophalen case by this Court which again is referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.188" offset="13468087">I wouldn't for a moment consider -- I'm sorry I find my time is in --</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.971" offset="13571218">But the -- there's no question but what -- there was extensive discussion in the Congress as to the meaning of the language that we're here particularly concern with any order or requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.134" offset="13643943">I have here represent pages of 40 congressional record beginning at 6685 and running through 6787.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.872" offset="13690859">I just like to say that in the discussion on the floor the -- the knowledge of these words and the import was so well understood that Senator Bacon asked not once but several times if there was any language in any words in the dictionary that could be more specific in substance and at one spot and this is short, so I suppose I must point to this extent at 40 congressional records 6773 when they were discussing an amendment which eventually became part of the Hepburn Act, Senator Bacon said, “Here is an amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa which is absolutely without limitation which is as broad as human language can make it, giving to the Court the right to review every order or requirement made by the Commission.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.488" offset="14149360">I started to say that finally that the one thing that I don't understand is the thought of the Commission that when an order -- when administrative findings and orders by the Commission in a reparation case are attacked by the losing party that the Commission shouldn't be called upon to defend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.934" offset="14235146">They admit, they found out the hard way in 337 U.S. that if they deny reparation it's proper to seek review -- to find out whether denial was proper as matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.838" offset="14286764">They found out in 363 that the losing party in a referral case, one that reached the Commission from me to the Court of Claims for example, the State Court or anything like that the losing party can seek review before the courts under Section 1336, but in the case of a railroad who loses before the Commission in a case, they say you can't have direct review there.</text>
