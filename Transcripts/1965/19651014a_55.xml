            <text syncTime="16.925" offset="171029">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.911" offset="187016">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Claims, the complaint charged United States for having infringed the Adams battery patent held by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.244" offset="236335">A Commissioner of the Court of Claims after an evidentiary hearing issued proposed findings and conclusions holding that the patent was valid and that some batteries of United States had infringed that patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.378" offset="296835">The full Court of Claims in the brief, one paragraph per curiam opinion adopted all of the findings and conclusions of its Commissioner on these two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.855" offset="342810">The Government sought certiorari and only one aspect to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.465" offset="361200">It left unchallenged that part of the decision below holding that there had been an infringement if the patent were valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.898" offset="394951">We brought to this part only the question whether the Adams' patent was valid patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.899" offset="426924">The basic principles involved in batteries of this general type are fairly easy to grasp.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.589" offset="461720">What's involved in this type of a battery are three elements, two electrodes, and an electrolyte.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.469" offset="497246">The electrodes are metallic stripes or cylinders or rods.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.576" offset="517726">The electrolyte is a liquid solution and the electrodes are suspended in this liquid solution and if the electrodes have a sufficiently different electro-motor force then small particles of matter known as ions will move from the positive electrode to the negative electrode.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.852" offset="602781">And that movement will take place through the liquid solution in which the two electrodes are inserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.665" offset="642069">An electrical charge can be recorded and measured by touching wires to the terminals of the electrodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.445" offset="673102">The lower court found that the Adams invention consisted of a combination of electrodes and a combination of electrodes only.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.321" offset="712704">This is set forth, we believe in finding 12th.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.517" offset="733393">The Commissioner's proposed finding which was subsequently adopted by the full court.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.597" offset="757739">And as said forth in those findings what the Adams' invention purported to teach was anode which is the positive electrode composed of magnesium and the cathode which is the negative electrode composed primarily of a copper salt known as “Cuprous Chloride”.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.707" offset="838196">It did not Court -- did not hold that the invention consisted of a combination of these electrodes with any particular electrolyte.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.991" offset="887306">Now, this brings us to the statutory standards of utility, novelty, and nonobviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.923" offset="919071">We conceived that the Adams' patent was useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.313" offset="932655">We raise no contention on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.156" offset="948015">We contend, however, that it meets neither the test of novelty nor the test of obviousness as set forth by the Congress in Sections 102 and 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.192" offset="988139">So far as novelty is concern, we believe that Skrivanoff, a British patent English issued in 1880 is as dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.444" offset="1029099">It was a combination patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.830" offset="1038712">It was not a carbon copy of Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.532" offset="1053550">Adams was not a carbon copy of it in all respects but in our view the differences are sufficiently mind and trivial that the two, after all intense and purposes the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.421" offset="1109034">Skrivanoff called for a magnesium anode.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.269" offset="1124498">Adams called for the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.004" offset="1139440">Skrivanoff called for a cathode composed of cuprous chloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.781" offset="1162533">Adams called for a cathode composed of cuprous chloride.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="270.055" offset="1183640">(Inaudible) all of the -- that was in that anode?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_w_douglas" startTime="274.456" stopTime="801.063">
            <label>Mr. John W. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="274.456" offset="1201194">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.718" offset="1202239">I'm going to continue Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.269" offset="1216449">In addition, Skrivanoff called for the addition cuprous chloride of carbon.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.439" offset="1237138">Adams called for the addition of carbon with a cuprous chloride cathode.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.811" offset="1258663">And finally, Skrivanoff however, did add other materials to carbon and to the cuprous chloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.152" offset="1291995">But in each cuprous chloride was the primary element in the cathode and there was no finding, indeed, no showing that this omission from Adams of these extra elements in Skrivanoff was significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.539" offset="1361481">Now, the Court sought to distinguish Skrivanoff on the basis of its non-operability and there was testimony to that effect and the Court found that it was inoperable.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.131" offset="1407875">Accepting that finding, we would say that operability in itself does not establish the novelty of a present invention over a prior art, or an element in that art because operability can stand from a number of different changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.488" offset="1481331">It might have stemmed from pure materials from a different type of container or from a larger electrode.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.910" offset="1511006">There's no inherent reason why operability should stem from a patentable change.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.893" offset="1546951">In this case, there were no findings of the operability of Adams was caused by the differences between the Skrivanoff and Adams cathode.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.188" offset="1584149">And only if a cause and effect can be shown between the differences in the two cathodes, in our view, can the differences which are minor on their face be shown to be significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.051" offset="1639528">Indeed, the record suggests that Skrivanoff did not work because of the nature of electrolyte it employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.487" offset="1677354">And there was testimony that the electrolyte in Skrivanoff was too strong and it had water being used, the battery probably would have worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.651" offset="1718000">There was no finding to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.405" offset="1725001">We're not resting our case, our novelty on this point but I'm merely saying is that unless there are some findings that a difference on operability stems from a difference in the make up of the two patents then there's no basis for distinguishing the prior art for reasons of novelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.523" offset="1817475">And of course, Your Honors, it is true that a presumption of validity normally attaches to the patent, when issued by the patent office.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.185" offset="1864077">No such presumption in our view should attach here.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.994" offset="1879333">The file wrapper in this case which discloses the proceedings in the patent office is Title Exhibit 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.497" offset="1909321">Unfortunately, we did not include that in the printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.456" offset="1925204">It is a part of the original record file with the clerk and the parties have stipulated that it can be referred to and cited by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.698" offset="1962193">But an examination of that file wrapper indicates no mention of the Skrivanoff patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.414" offset="1989047">And since the most important element in the prior art at least in our view was not mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.680" offset="2014124">It's difficult to see how the patent should be assumed to be valid merely because of its issuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.425" offset="2045053">At a minimum, it suggests that no presumption of validity should attach so far as Skrivanoff is concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.439" offset="2081102">This brings us to the requirement that a patent not be obvious to a person skilled in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.075" offset="2115688">First, if a patent is found to be old, that's the end of it, can't be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.356" offset="2136795">If it's new, it must still get over the test of non obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.049" offset="2155604">Here, the Commissioner in the Court found that each of individual components comprising the Adams invention was known and had long been known in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.617" offset="2205863">And the respondents have frankly conceded in their brief that this was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.089" offset="2227702">As a matter of fact the court below found that each of the individual elements have been available for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.874" offset="2254869">Magnesium is used as an electrode had been anticipated by four sources cuprous chloride had been anticipated by three so that the question in terms of obviousness is whether or not the combination of these individually known electrodes can be said not to have been obvious to a person skilled in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.494" offset="2341386">And I would suggest that on its face an argument to this effect cannot be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.834" offset="2366673">An electrode does not exist in the vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.249" offset="2380361">It does not generate electricity by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.491" offset="2393318">It generates electricity only in combination with another electrode.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.175" offset="2412022">When your composing a battery of this type, you're looking for possible combinations of electrodes and your looking for a difference in the electromotor force.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.548" offset="2465520">If you have used magnesium in a battery, you know in general what's its electromotor force is in relation to other elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.742" offset="2498330">Same thing is true if you have used cuprous chloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.082" offset="2511705">So anyone in our view who knew that magnesium and cuprous chloride had been individually used as electrodes would have occurred to him to at least try combining the two and discover whether or not a practical battery could be developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.591" offset="2585788">And it isn't a matter of just abstract reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.055" offset="2599581">There were suggestions or at least strong hints in the prior literature and the prior patents, to the combination to this effect was feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.529" offset="2649527">The Codd Treatise in 1929 called for a magnesium anode and a copper electrode -- copper cathode, Juno which is a patent, 1934, called for the union of magnesium on the one hand, a lead chloride on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.829" offset="2750673">If one looks at the electromotor rating contained in Codd which describes the various elements in terms of their rating whether they're positive or negative one would see that lead and copper are very close.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.054" offset="2815561">Just as one would see that magnesium comes near the top of the scale and chlorine comes near the bottom of the scale, and the important thing in an electrode or one of the important things in choosing an electrode is to choose one where there is a substantial difference between the two electrodes to be employed in the battery itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.070" offset="2895600">And finally so far as obviousness is concern, Skrivanoff -- even if it didn't completely anticipate the Adams battery, surely suggested the possibility of combining magnesium and copper chloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.358" offset="2952756">It is true that there are other elements not present in Adams but the possibility of omitting some of these other elements but not have been difficult, indeed, would have been the most natural thing in the world for someone skilled in the art to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.475" offset="3017226">So all we have in our view is a selection of known battery elements from a known and finite list of possible components and a battery of known design with no change in the respective functions of the elements, that is to say, the electrodes comprising the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.126" offset="3103848">Now, the Court in the respondents seek to avoid what we consider to be the obvious thrust of the prior art by pointing to some unique characteristics and results found by the Court to have been developed by the Adams batteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.365" offset="3172812">These findings are set forth and the Court's finding 23 and there are two a number.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.776" offset="3202487">A constant current, sometimes referred to as a linear potential and the ability to operate under low temperatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.610" offset="3241775">And on this basis, the respondents in the lower court contend that the requirement of nonobviousness was satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.604" offset="3281795">But this approach in our view misconceives the basic nature of the obviousness test.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.518" offset="3437484">This approach Your Honors in our view doesn't do justice to the standard laid down by the Congress in Section 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.102" offset="3479803">What Congress wanted in that Section was a comparison between the alleged teachings of the patent and the claims in the patent and the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.564" offset="3525674">And one looks to secondary evidence such as results or commercial success only where the evidence in the prior art is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.484" offset="3569351">If only there some kind of equivocation in the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.731" offset="3590248">When there is no ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.875" offset="3598921">When the prior art is clear in terms of obviousness then one may look at this secondary element.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.462" offset="3629223">It's a sort of best evidence rule which the Courts have developed and makes the great deal of sense because what the Congress was seeking to protect in accordance with the constitutional provisions was the enhancement of scientific advances and the encouragements are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.177" offset="3704038">Here, the obviousness in our view is so strong that you don't look for outside elements or outside matters such as commercial success or new results.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.399" offset="3757014">And I might say that even if and we would dispute this most vigorly but -- vigorously but even if this were said to be a close question in terms of the prior art the new results asserted here would not have established patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.522" offset="3821484">There were no findings in this Court of a long search for these particular qualities.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.958" offset="3851160">It's true that there was a statement that the individual elements have been available for 50 years, that doesn't establish a long search.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.072" offset="3887626">It's true that the Court found that there was a long standing need that in itself doesn't establish the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.083" offset="3915734">And maybe any number of reasons why scientists devote their attention to one thing rather than to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.677" offset="3942066">Priorities, problems with the prior art, the point is, what were looking at is whether or not someone did in fact searched for these qualities for a long time and there's no finding in the Court's record that this was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.726" offset="4010297">That being so the long felt need referred to by the Court would not have been important even if these were a close question on the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.913" offset="4051048">We don't believe that it was a close question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.435" offset="4349158">The first is according to the lower court that operability will distinguish one patent from its prior reference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1074.632" offset="4401925">We think there has to be a finding with the operability in fact stemmed from the difference between the two patents themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.858" offset="4430764">The second paragraph which the lower court committed was that it seemed to be precluding that new results in and of themselves was sufficiently to get over the test of nonobviousness set forth in Section 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.506" offset="4493354">And I think it important in preserving the delicate balance which this Court has long monitored between competitive enterprise on the one hand and patent monopoly on the other that these two doctrines be as -- made clear that they're not applicable --</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.255" offset="5052374">As my Brother Douglas has said, the claims of the patent that are involved in suit, the entire 11 and we have relied primarily upon claims one and ten as being exemplary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.147" offset="5103992">Claim one of the Adams' patents reads, a battery comprising a liquid container, a magnesium electropositive electrode inside the container and having an exterior terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.905" offset="5158954">A fused cuprous chloride electronegative electrode and a terminal connector with said electronegative electrode.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.608" offset="5185808">Claim ten calls in a battery, the combination of a magnesium electropositive electrode and an electronegative electrode comprising cuprous chloride fused with the carbon catalytic agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.640" offset="5249964">These elements had all been available in the art for more than 50 years prior to Adams had -- went on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.955" offset="5295208">Magnesium was isolated in 1854, became commercially available in 1870, was suggested by Skrivanoff in 1888.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.662" offset="5333974">Cuprous chloride came into the art about the same time and was mentioned by Skrivanoff the proto-chloride of copper means cuprous chloride as a Government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.207" offset="5380159">In the Skrivanoff recipe -- in Skrivanoff disclosure which Mr. Justice White asked the question about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.840" offset="5418715">We had cathode which comprised carbon or copper paste with the paste of phosphoric acid, amorphous phosphorous, metallic copper, and cuprous chloride, mixed together with sulfuric acid and applied hot to the carbon and covered with blotting paper impregnated with zinc chloride and sulfuric acid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.762" offset="5538461">And when our expert put that together with the pure materials that he had available in 1960 and I don't know that the materials in 1888 were any purer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.990" offset="5579316">He had two files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.014" offset="5587466">That was the use of cuprous chloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.980" offset="5599274">I asked the Government's expert when he testified as to Skrivanoff whether when the mixture of the cathode was put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.007" offset="5627382">Did it still contain cuprous chloride?</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.809" offset="5638562">And he said, I don't know?</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.136" offset="5643891">All I have is the information concerned contained in the patent and beyond that I had no information whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.462" offset="5677223">Following that, our expert attempted to put the entire Skrivanoff battery together including the magnesium anode and the electrolytes specified by Skrivanoff and he had an explosion which blew out the vent of his laboratory which is the device for exhausting air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.128" offset="5743888">And at that point, he stopped working on Skrivanoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.590" offset="5765726">Now, the interesting thing about this battery and I would really like to show it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.592" offset="5789759">I've taken the trouble or the effort here of putting together the parts of it because it's so very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.732" offset="5810343">This is a piece of magnesium which I have bent over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.254" offset="5828420">Started out like this, it's now bent this way and this is a cuprous chloride electrode which has been combined with a bit of carbon and it takes about five minutes to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.851" offset="5862797">You take a piece of cuprous screening such as you use the mosquito netting and you draw it through a crucible of cuprous chloride and you get this sort of plating out on the wire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.198" offset="5904175">And I connected the two electrodes together to a bowl and I might say that I'm going to put this together using the method taught by Alessandro Volta in 1880 --</text>

            <text syncTime="1472.547" offset="5993514">But this is a very, very simple thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.484" offset="6005321">You just take a piece of Kleenex and wrap it around the cathode so as to prevent a short circuit between the cathode and the anode.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.080" offset="6035728">Then you put the cathode inside the anode and hopefully it'll work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.380" offset="6076897">Now, actually since 1800 everyone has known that this combination really can't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.090" offset="6135724">Batteries were invented by the great Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta in 1880 -- 1800 and at that time, he determined by a very simple experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.210" offset="6176162">He used a sheet of silver, a piece of silver and a piece of copper, between them he put a little piece of cardboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.167" offset="6212002">And he took that battery and soaked it in water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.830" offset="6226735">First water-activated battery and the first one that didn't worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.809" offset="6242617">And immediately determined that since it didn't worked he had add substances such as salts or basic materials or acids to the water in order to produce the ions that my Brother Douglas has mentioned so that electricity can be conducted by the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.131" offset="6315865">Pure water is an insulator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.852" offset="6322761">It will not conduct electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.149" offset="6331956">Magnesium is insoluble than water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.162" offset="6343973">So is cuprous chloride.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.814" offset="6350660">So is cuprous chloride with carbon, insoluble in water so when you put the two substances into water neither one can dissolve in the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.284" offset="6384515">You can't get a chemical reaction to form a conductive electrolyte and the water remaining can conduct electricity, so on the basis of conventional voltaic theory, this battery cannot operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.765" offset="6438431">And that's the very good reason why nobody bought it with these things together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.045" offset="6455568">As the expert the trial testified, in 1939 it was ridiculous for Adams to take two insoluble substances like magnesium and cuprous chloride and put them in an insulator like water and expect to have a battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.706" offset="6514186">Now, if I have some water which of course (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.174" offset="6556087">Now specifically, the Government's position is that the battery is not new, it is useful and it's obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.661" offset="6594017">There is a very short answer to this and the answer is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.535" offset="6609481">If the components of Adams had been put together before, the battery would have had the characteristics of the Adams battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.736" offset="6642291">Chemicals are chemicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.263" offset="6648456">They work the same way every time if you have the same chemicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.131" offset="6663920">But the fact of the matter is that there has never been a battery prior to Adams that had its characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.962" offset="6691192">The Adams battery characteristics are opposite in most cases to every prior art battery, a 140 years of battery research.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.017" offset="6731421">This is the first different battery since Volta invented the battery of 1800.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.754" offset="6758379">Secondly, the Government says it's obvious but when Adams took his battery a month after Pearl Harbor and went to Fort Monmouth as he was directed to do and displayed it to the assembled battery experts including Dr. Fishback and Dr. Mendel, who later on filed their owned patent on the same battery, they looked at the battery working in front of them with a steam coming out of it and told Adams it can't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.469" offset="6873213">That's the battery the Government say's is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.790" offset="6886484">Now, I'll put in the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.947" offset="6895156">Now, I'm using warm water here, hopefully so that this battery may activate before my 30 minutes are up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.730" offset="6934340">The Government relies upon two additional references, the Niaudet text and the Hayes -- and the Hayes patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.373" offset="6964851">Both, well, I think Niaudet with 1880 and Hayes is 1883.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.496" offset="6989406">The Niaudet text teaches the second water-activated battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.970" offset="7007274">My Brother Just -- my Brother Douglas is correct on this and in the same text if you read it and you'll find it at page -- Record 515 on the same or the next page it says that the Niaudet battery which was actually the Marie Davy battery did not work and it didn't work until another scientist named De la Rue came along and put salts or sal ammoniac in the water and then the battery worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.934" offset="7115107">So the art had it's understanding of the battery theory reinforced by Niaudet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.757" offset="7138408">You have to take all of the Government's references put together because when you take the totality of the Government's references in conjunction with the ones that Adams put in, you arrive at the inescapable conclusion that what the Government and Adams combined to prove was that no one in the battery art believed that water could possibly function in a battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.231" offset="7220328">Everybody in the battery art knew that you couldn't use magnesium in a battery and the cuprous chloride had never been successfully used in any practical battery and that's the totality of the Government's art and ours.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.667" offset="7398066">But as a matter of fact to be fair to Adams, Adams is a natural genius and he disbelieved these theories that I've been talking about.</text>

            <label>Mr. John A. Reilly</label>
            <text syncTime="1910.486" offset="7745285">Oh, quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.669" offset="7750092">That's proven by the article Dr. Fishback wrote in 1952 where he said, “When we looked at this battery originally we thought that because of its self-initiation and exothermic reaction was inoperative but now we realized that those two characteristics give it two of his most important advantages and that's why it files this patent on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.809" offset="7826578">And my Brother Douglas finds both with the claims of Adams, but if you read the claims of Fishback, you will find that Fishback is claiming a battery with a magnesium anode and a cuprous chloride cathode with carbon in it except he said that my battery is porous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.828" offset="7894706">He didn't tell the United States patent office which the Department of Justice sometime excoriates that the Adams' patent taught how to make the cathode porous by the use of carbon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.819" offset="7950608">And the 1880 Niaudet reference which has just been referred to taught the exact method that Fishback used to make his electrode.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.904" offset="7990941">So that the invention of Fishback is anticipated by the art that is cited by the Government today, yet the Government has not disclaimed that patent, it is still viable, it could be asserted against anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.441" offset="8045171">Indeed, it could be asserted against Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.333" offset="8056665">Now the third reference, the fourth reference presently relied on by the Government is Codd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.226" offset="8080280">And the Codd textbook I think is the most devastating answer to the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.640" offset="8105984">It's a textbook published in 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.943" offset="8115179">It's fairly extensive in three places, widely separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.443" offset="8133151">It mentions one, magnesium, and teaches that if you put magnesium into a sulfuric acid opposed to copper you can measure its electromotive force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.724" offset="8174320">Two other or three other references put in by the Government teach that if you put magnesium and sulfuric acid it will be destroyed in a matter of minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.605" offset="8209742">Other references put in by the Government teach, teach no one knew how to use magnesium in a primary battery as of 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.827" offset="8238686">So it was perfectly obvious that what Codd was teaching was merely an electrical measurement method, it was not a battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.457" offset="8265226">The second substance mentioned by Codd is silver chloride 40 pages away from the mention of magnesium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.159" offset="8300022">The third being mentioned by Codd is that the arts was trying to make water-activated batteries and it gave several examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.114" offset="8339832">And these water-activated batteries were made by putting the salts which you need to make the water conductive into the interstices between the electrodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.328" offset="8376717">Then you pour the water in, the salts are melted by the water and the battery becomes conductive and operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.956" offset="8403153">So there in Codd mind you, is magnesium, silver chloride, and water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.540" offset="8433560">No one suggested that they could ever be put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.427" offset="8445053">Codd didn't suggest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.121" offset="8451845">The closest the Government comes to anticipating Adams is defined that almost all of the substances used by Adams which were cuprous chloride magnesium activate the battery with water were combined in a book, not in a battery, 1928 ten years before Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.082" offset="8531675">Now, actually all of the references are distinguished because of the ref -- several references cited by my Brother Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.445" offset="8561142">He mentioned Jiu Mao, and Jiu Mao was a patent in 1937, just two years before Adams and Jiu Mao said, “Here is the way you make magnesium work in a battery.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.382" offset="8604923">Jiu Mao doesn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.794" offset="8610565">The testimony shows Adams' expert, faithfully reproduced Jiu Mao tested it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.445" offset="8633135">It does not function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.379" offset="8640867">That's Jiu Mao.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.978" offset="8647241">The second one is that silver chloride is cited by the Government and may refer to the Hayes and Niaudet, those patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.016" offset="8675453">Now, at the trial, Adams insisted that cuprous chloride which he disclosed in his patent and silver chloride which is not disclosed in his patent but which he told the army about in 1942 were equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.938" offset="8735117">You said they'll both work in my battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.762" offset="8746402">We put in eight requested findings of fact to the Commissioner requesting the Commissioner to find that cuprous chloride and silver chloride were equivalents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.210" offset="8780257">The Government opposed them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.613" offset="8793840">The Commissioner in his decision stated that he refused to find that cuprous chloride and silver chloride were equivalent, he therefore held that the Government's procurement of silver chloride, magnesium, water-activated batteries was not an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.708" offset="8858206">We acquiesced the Government with no exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.498" offset="8873357">Now the Government comes to you and says in its petition for the reason for granting certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.231" offset="8896345">Cuprous chloride and silver chloride are equivalence and you should reverse the Commissioner because he didn't in fact find that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.915" offset="8927065">In other words, they ask you to reverse the Commissioner on a finding of fact -- for filing to find or for making a decision that they themselves induced the Commissioner to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.779" offset="8978474">And as you know we have a motion pending on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.114" offset="8995819">Now, to get to the point about the battery being unobvious, the reason the Adams battery could -- the reason the scientist couldn't believe the Adam's battery when saw it operating is because in fact it does not operate like any other battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.617" offset="9053811">I have here a draft which is a copy of plaintiff's Exhibit 38 with the exception of the two ledgers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.268" offset="9084426">And this graph was made by a battery scientist at Fort Monmouth named Shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.079" offset="9103653">Now, Shore was not one of the men that Adams talked to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.879" offset="9114937">Shore was the man who was given a -- just simply a copy of the Adams' patent and asks to do some experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.973" offset="9143254">And the experimentation he did was to follow that art and make several batteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.279" offset="9160495">This is one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.605" offset="9165824">And if you see this curve, this flat line going out about three-quarters away across the graph that is the curve of the battery he made following simply the instructions in the Adams' patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.662" offset="9218069">Now, he had some other duties that were not fully explained but at any event he took each of the elements in the Adam's patent such as magnesium and he tried all kinds of other chlorides with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.086" offset="9267702">And then he would take cuprous chloride and find all kinds of different metals with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.150" offset="9287973">And then he experimented with different types of electrolytes and he found out that the only combination that worked was the one that Adams thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.507" offset="9321409">All the others were failures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.460" offset="9329246">At the same time he ran some tests on two commercial Colesman's (ph) batteries which at that time and this is 1944 were being procured by the Government for high altitude meteorological research and he plotted the curves of the voltage delivery of those two batteries and here you see that they go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.742" offset="9422346">Now this is an experimental Adams battery, built by a man who built two or three of them against the best commercial procurements of batteries that the Government could manage in the middle of the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.360" offset="9476786">Your Honors, this is the real prior arts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.887" offset="9490892">This is what's Skrivanoff pays Niaudet, Codd and all of the rest of them taught the battery art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.835" offset="9518686">You couldn't make a battery that would give you any constant current on continuous service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.675" offset="9546062">You couldn't make a battery that didn't show an early failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.372" offset="9568841">This battery of Adams is the first battery that would give continuous power efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.855" offset="9594755">Every other battery when you put it on in continuous service declines so fast that it reached the point of an operativenss -- even operativeness in a very short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.807" offset="9638640">This is the first battery that will give a level power like a generator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.979" offset="9655254">And practically every electrical device, radio sending or receiving sets, whatever it may be requires level electrical power to work efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.803" offset="9694542">It cannot work efficiently on declining (Inaudible) fading radios and various other patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.153" offset="9719933">The third thing about this battery and the reason why the battery scientists at Fort Monmouth had so much trouble understanding how it could work is that when Adams demonstrated it and I don't think you can see that here there's too much water but the battery heats up and as a matter of fact it will boil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.383" offset="9788897">The water in the Adams battery will actually come to a boil, steam will come out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.872" offset="9806869">Now, every prior art voltaic battery, when it begin to heat up it was polarizing, losing power and destroying itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.276" offset="9840515">In the Adams battery the heating reaction is pure side reaction, it does not affect the level -- continuous production of electrical power whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.624" offset="9885863">But, because of the boiling phenomenon the Government felt and these experts felt that this was a battery that was running away and destroying itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.479" offset="9925256">In fact it is the boiling of the Adams battery that permits the battery to operate at -960 degrees below zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.105" offset="9963813">Almost a 100 degrees below the freezing temperature of the water it's filled with and this is the battery that has licked the age old problem in the battery art of low temperature performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.798" offset="10010520">There is no other battery that will work well at 60 degrees below zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.711" offset="10030268">There's just isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.245" offset="10036328">And the Adams battery today is used by the Government for more unusual and usual uses than any other battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.948" offset="10075199">This battery for example is used in meteorological research.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.170" offset="10088051">Its sent up to a 100,000 feet in the stratosphere where the temperature goes down to 60 degrees below zero and this is the only battery that will work under those conditions effectively.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.658" offset="10157955">Now, there were other reasons why the Government experts could not believe that it worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.764" offset="10178435">And these are the reasons why the battery is not really obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.746" offset="10194317">You can't start this battery when you want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.166" offset="10208005">It isn't like everyone of the prior art batteries which -- they are both experts at the trial called a bell ringer, when they pushed the button, the battery delivers current and the bell rings, when you take your finger off the button it stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.129" offset="10255862">The Adams battery won't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.350" offset="10264743">It takes a half hour to start the Adams battery if you put it together unless you use special methods such as hot water to energize it rapidly and if you don't do that the bat -- and another thing about the battery is that you can't stop it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.547" offset="10329527">I can des --I can take that bulb out and break the external circuit, that battery will go right on boiling and generating and using itself up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.236" offset="10360351">That's what the Government experts called a self-destructive feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.887" offset="10378951">The other thing about it of course is the fact that it boils over and conventionally all the experts know that a battery that heats up was destroying itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.540" offset="10409566">Now, we say that the Government takes the position that the Adams battery is simply not new and simply obvious because it doesn't wish to address itself, so the real question for which possibly this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.785" offset="10486471">We feel that if you apply the test which were set forth in the A &amp; P case and in Cuno and in Ray-O-Vac and when I refer to the ANP case I refer to both the majority in the concurring opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.772" offset="10542477">We feel that when you apply the facts of records to those criteria, you'll find that Adams meets the criteria of ANP completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.037" offset="10579571">For example, in ANP it was stated that as a result of the combination there had to be something unusual, the whole had to be greater that the sum of the parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.454" offset="10621158">Now what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.068" offset="10627636">Supposing a battery that the whole were just equal to the sum of the parts, you're using a better anode, a better cathode, possibly energize it in some better way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.565" offset="10669641">You would get a better conventional battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.427" offset="10681031">These carriers might have come out a little further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.367" offset="10692838">But it would still be a bell ringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.968" offset="10699212">It would still give you only intermittent as opposed to continuous power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.470" offset="10717288">It would still give you only declining power as opposed to leveled power and it wouldn't work at low temperatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.346" offset="10744769">In the Adams battery you put together an anode and a cathode and what do you get?</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.471" offset="10769220">You get a battery that's not like any other battery, indeed it's more like a heat engine than a battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.226" offset="10792312">And it develops power in a way that it's none like a battery but indeed is like a generator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.977" offset="10815300">The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.228" offset="10828257">The second point made I believe in ANP was that it is necessary that the useful arts in majority opinion or the particular science involved had to be greatly advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.909" offset="10883009">In this case it would be the science of electrochemistry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.597" offset="10893772">I don't think the Government disputes that the science of electrochemistry has been greatly advanced by Adams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.406" offset="10921044">Here we have the first unexplained experimental results since Volta.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.269" offset="11016443">First of all, no one understands why this combination does generate current.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.534" offset="11037550">Secondly, no one understands why this delivery curve of voltage remains leveled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.414" offset="11061060">This is a primary battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.153" offset="11067956">You put the parts in it with all the electrical energy when you put it together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.008" offset="11083421">And then as it grows older and is used there's less and less material and you would expect and indeed all prior art batteries decline as you have less material, less magnesium, whatever it may be working in the battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.926" offset="11135039">This does not and no one can understand why it doesn't go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.333" offset="11152697">Almost every curve that you see in nature are natural phenomenon has a curve to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.108" offset="11175790">That's why they're called curves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.592" offset="11181746">This is the first straight line curve and when it comes to the end of it's life it falls right off the cliff, this peculiar little zigzag in this graph is due to the fact that Mr. Shore lets its battery run out of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.984" offset="11239320">So you put some water in it, gaining back the life and decline.</text>

            <text syncTime="2807.490" offset="11333360">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.244" offset="11336391">Yes, magnesium is not soluble in water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.796" offset="11346526">To any substantial degree I might say that magnesium is soluble in boiling water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.231" offset="11372335">So I suppose if you want to make a battery out of magnesium all you have to do is create one that will boil and if that's the answer this is the only boiling battery, that's true though.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.087" offset="11427715">The second point or the last point and this particularly applied to the concurring opinion in ANP with the requirement that masters in the field of electrochemistry should have recognized the contribution to be an important scientific advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.262" offset="11488423">And in that connection I would like to just mention briefly what the masters in the field of electrochemistry have said about the Adams battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.845" offset="11522800">Dr. Fishback, magnesium, cuprous chloride batteries have obtained considerable importance particularly as meteorological batteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.773" offset="11558431">Dr. Chove (ph) in 1952, the exact nature of the complex chemical current producing reactions of this type of cell is not known in any substantial detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.842" offset="11606706">Morse, the water-activated battery systems are among the relatively new power sources which have become extremely important to the military during the past decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.433" offset="11645053">Morse, the definite trend to water-activated batteries for high altitude and seawater applications indicates they are unsurpassed as one shot power packs for low temperature use and for underwater operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.974" offset="11699284">Morse, there can be no doubt that the addition of water-activated batteries to the family of power sources has brought about developments which would otherwise have been technically or economically impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.461" offset="11753200">Recognition by outstanding experts in the field of electrochemistry that this untutored simple man has made an important advance in the science of electrochemistry and I think the requirements that this Court enunciated in ANP for invention have been fully met by Adams and beyond that I think the statement in Cuno has been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.030" offset="11851525">I think this is surely a work of creative genius not merely the skill of the calling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.703" offset="11874200">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.290" offset="11900531">If the Court please, so far as constant current is concerned, that had been suggested in a number of prior references, Wensky, Niaudet, Hayes, and Jiu-Mao all contained in the record and the suggestion in those prior references was that a metallic chloride would do the trick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.083" offset="12007737">When this battery was taken up to Fort Monmouth, difficulty was that it boiled over and that's what put the army scientist off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.739" offset="12054340">But I think the significant point about my res -- distinguished opponents argument is that it was devoted almost entirely to results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.579" offset="12097703">There was no detailed effort to justify the scientific events in terms of the prior art except to say that one was operable and the other wasn't and that something else achieve certain results whereas others had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.276" offset="12172518">Even if what he said was absolutely correct, this would still not established patentability because the test under Section 103 is, had this been apparent to someone skilled in the field in the prior art and there's no findings that there was any such seach in this case and in fact the comparison of the Skrivanoff and Adams' bat -- patents saw that they're virtually congruent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.990" offset="12295293">And for these two reasons we believe that patentability should not be sustained.</text>
