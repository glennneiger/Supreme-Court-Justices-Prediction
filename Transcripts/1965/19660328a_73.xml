            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- 73, 74, 75, 76, 77.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.779" offset="150444">Mr. Sonnett, proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_f_sonnett" startTime="14.663" stopTime="635.728">
            <label>Mr. John F. Sonnett</label>
            <text syncTime="14.663" offset="162043">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.677" offset="174059">There are five appeals by the Government and four corporate defendants from a decree below in a civil antitrust action charging violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.434" offset="225155">In accordance with this Court's order for consolidation of the appeals and allowing additional time for argument, we have reached an agreement of counsel which we first meet with your approval as to the order of presentation and allocating points for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.818" offset="302686">In 74 for Grinnell Corporation, I propose Mr. Chief Justice to take 30 minutes and save 15 for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.018" offset="339466">I will be followed by Mr. Flinn for American District Telegraph who proposes to take 20 minutes, by Mr. Drye for Holmes Electric who will take 12.5 minutes by Mr. J. Francis Hayden for Automatic Fire Alarm who will take 12.5 minutes, and following Mr. Friedman's argument for the Government, I trust that our schedule works out well enough so that I will have indeed some brief rebuttal time.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.352" offset="448763">The questions presented to Your Honors are first, Did the defendants have a fair trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="93.198" offset="476139">Secondly, whether the resulting decree was improper, and then there are a variety of other questions relating to substantive aspects of the case such as the proper definition of a relevant market and the specific relief problems, these being dealt with fully in the briefs and will be argued by other counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.312" offset="564642">I would like briefly to describe the parties and the business involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.648" offset="589928">Grinnell, whom I represent, is a widely held company with some 5,000 stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.036" offset="619499">For many years, it's been engaged primarily in making and selling products used in the building construction industry such as pipe fittings, plumbing and heating equipment and sprinklers.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.257" offset="664430">For some years before 1961, Grinnell also manufactured some types of so-called actuating devices installed in some sprinkler systems, these being know -- known as waterflow alarms and sprinkler supervisory devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.974" offset="743320">They said the purpose of detecting the movement of water through a sprinkler system or the fact that the system is inoperable.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.842" offset="782712">There will be references in our argument as well to central stations.Central stations are premises located within 25 miles of the protective premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.358" offset="840808">The hazards involved being fire or burglary and the central station receives of at least telephones wires, a signal from a transmitter connected in the case of water protection to an actuating device, and in the case of burglary protection to some kind of burglar alarm.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.780" offset="934536">Following the receipt of the signal at the central station, appropriate action is then taken by personnel of the station who man the station on a 24-hour a day basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.681" offset="986049">These central stations also used to receive a variety of automatic signals from devices of other kinds with which Grinnell never has had any connection such as heat, smoke detection, and burglary detection devices, none of which obviously require a sprinkler system.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.234" offset="1072358">Grinnell itself has never been in the central station business.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.872" offset="1086882">It is not a service organization at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.343" offset="1100779">It sells plumbing and heating products and its only connection with the central station business involved in this case has been its former manufacturing sale of actuating devices and its stock interest in the three alarm company defendants before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.693" offset="1174131">The alarm company defendants are Automatic Fire Alarm Company referred to throughout as AFA, which is in the central station fire protection business in three cities -- New York, Philadelphia, and Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.392" offset="1248946">Grinnell acquired a majority of stock interest in that company in 1949 and now owns 90% of its stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.286" offset="1288547">The second company involved of the alarm companies is Holmes Electric Protective Company, which furnishes central station burglary and holdup protection in New York, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.809" offset="1346644">Grinnell acquired 100% of ownership of Holmes from the New York Telephone Company in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.939" offset="1383111">The third alarm company defendant is American District Telegraph, referred to here as ADT, and that company furnishes central station protection against fire, burglary, and other hazards in 115 cities throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.916" offset="1455000">Grinnell acquired a majority stock interest in ADT from Western Union in 1953 and now owns 80% of its stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.936" offset="1495124">These three alarm company defendants are engaged in rendering protection services in a variety of ways, all of which will be described to the Court later.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.720" offset="1538278">For purposes of my argument, they are presently irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.147" offset="1555937">I come to the brief description of the decree below.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.941" offset="1579133">The decree below adjudicated all four defendants to have violated Sections 1 and 2 with respect to a market described by the court below as the National Market of Insurance Accredited Central Station Protection Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.721" offset="1650291">The first of the so-called three-pronged decree relating to relief enjoins the defendants generally from monopolizing or restraining trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.562" offset="1693654">The Government's brief at pages 38 and 39 as conceded that that injunctive provision was defective under the decisions of this Court because it's too broad, so that aspect of the relief has been conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.405" offset="1756975">Another prong of the three-pronged decree was an injunction against the employment really providing for the banishment from employment of James Douglas Fleming, who was the president of Grinnell and a director of the alarm companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.102" offset="1831790">That provision, forbade his employment ever again by any of the four companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.943" offset="1863137">The Government here again has conceded that the relief was improper and should be deleted from the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.641" offset="1901902">The third prong, which I would address myself to primarily was that Grinnell should be required to dispose of all of its stock in all of the alarm company defendants and never acquire a stock in any such alarm company again.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.813" offset="1986644">On the first of the two questions whether the defendants had a fair trial, I should preface by -- what I have to say Your Honors by saying it's a rather difficult argument to make but nevertheless it must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.002" offset="2055398">The case was assigned especially to the Honorable Charles E. Wyzanski Jr. after Judge Day of Rhode Island and Judge Sweeney of Massachusetts had each disqualified themselves successfully -- successively on their own motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.531" offset="2129481">After the case was assigned to Judge Wyzanski, there were extensive discovery proceedings and a number of conferences with the Court relating to the administration of the case, discovery matters, so on, during which the Court consistently urged the parties to settle the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.337" offset="2204714">The parties engaged in extensive -- rather extensive consent decree negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.983" offset="2227284">And one of the principle problems were that although the complaint demanded divestiture of Grinnell's stock interest in ADT only, the Government raised the stakes and insisted that Grinnell should be divested of its interest in all three companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.100" offset="2307741">There were other stumbling blocks to a consent decree disposition but that was the principle one from our point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.556" offset="2341595">So, there are no agreement was ever reached on a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.175" offset="2360090">In the course of the pretrial proceedings, there were three pretrial hearings with Judge Wyzanski, each of which is of critical importance to the fair trial question which Your Honors have before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.281" offset="2432502">The first was December 18, 1963, the second was May 28, 1964, and the third was June 3, 1964 just on the eve of the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.075" offset="2495718">The -- our brief in Appendix A has a full transcript of all of these pretrial conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.416" offset="2545037">And I think that Your Honors may well conclude that Appendix A should be read in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.989" offset="2579310">They say they deserve reading in full so that you may have a true flavor of what occurred at these pretrial conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.466" offset="2613269">I would like to turn briefly to the pretrial conference of the December 18, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.223" offset="2644302">Your Honor --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="635.728" stopTime="637.427">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="635.728" offset="2646288">Mr. Sonnett, that was the --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_f_sonnett" startTime="637.427" stopTime="1107.522">
            <label>Mr. John F. Sonnett</label>
            <text syncTime="637.427" offset="2653080">That is the first of the three, Your Honor, relevant for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.056" offset="2671574">Your Honors will find the transcript of that at Appendix A13 -- A1-13, I'm sorry, of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.490" offset="2709295">It's in the record commencing at page 118.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.117" offset="2731865">The purpose of that pretrial conference was to report to the Court on the status of the consent decree negotiations and to arrange a schedule for the disposition pretrial of objections which the defense had to some 100 depositions and hundreds of proposed exhibits, all discovery having been completed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.526" offset="2833429">But at that meeting of December 18, counsel for the defendants suggested that there ought to be a further pretrial invoking the procedures recommended in the Handbook of Recommended Procedures for the Trial of Protracted Cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.680" offset="2910124">The counsel pointed out that the procedure as outlined in the handbook would have two objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.672" offset="2942098">The first, to define the issues in the case, and the second to offer an opportunity for the Court to assist in arriving at a settlement, if possible, after of frank discussion as the handbook recommends, all the Government's objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.617" offset="3009808">The Court at that time welcomed and I used the Court's words, welcomed the suggestion as an invitation to the Court to participate in a discussion of relief without addressing itself to the merits, and as being in accordance with what is quite customary practice and very helpful in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.384" offset="3112939">Thereupon, an order was made by Judge Wyzanski of December 18, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.284" offset="3140524">It is in Appendix A13 to our brief at 133 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.717" offset="3166229">And that order provided expressly among other things that there would be a further pretrial conference and I quote, “For the primary purpose of discussing the relief which would be appropriate if in the event plaintiff prevails.”</text>
            <text syncTime="784.432" offset="3241148">From December through the following months until April of 1964, the parties were engaged in consent decree negotiations and working on consent decree and relief problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.630" offset="3309902">And the parties submitted in accordance with the Court's suggestion, proposed forms of consent decrees and briefs on relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.898" offset="3350967">They came before the Court again on May 28 for a pretrial conference which the parties thought was going to consent itself with the matter of discussion of settlement in accordance with the handbook procedures, and the transcript of that pretrial conference is at A15 of our appendix, record 252.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.901" offset="3454934">Despite the fact that the prior order had directed that the primary question to be discussed was a matter of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.145" offset="3483982">After May 28 meeting, the Court brushed, decide entirely any discussion of the matter of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.385" offset="3508955">And the Court said, and again, I use the Court's words, “You would do better to get together with the Government than go to trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="860.342" offset="3544691">Judge Wyzanski emphasized that he knew that the trial was not going to take very long.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.522" offset="3565484">And he thereupon peremptorily set the trial date to June 15, some 18 days after the date of this pretrial conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.806" offset="3602578">And he stated, and I quote from record 257, “There would be no delays, postponements, or further method of avoiding the impact of this Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="889.523" offset="3661511">The parties were there abruptly confronted with the task of getting ready for trial in several weeks, not knowing which of the voluminous depositions and documents, which the Government relied on, would be used as admissible evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.678" offset="3726085">And a motion therefore was presented to Judge Wyzanski for a reasonable adjournment of two months in the trial date, and for a definition of the relief issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.202" offset="3768195">That is to say whether the relief we were confronted with was the relief as prayed for in the complaint for the wholesale divestiture and other relief which the Government sought in the proposed form of decree, its proposed form of a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.042" offset="3843532">And the Court denied that motion in all respects and rather than characterized the Court's frame of mind, I think I can do justice to the problem only by reading his words.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.834" offset="3894732">The Court said and I'm reading from the record at 281, A31 of our appendix, “The Court - I can't understand frankly why you don't realize that you have forced me to look at the documents in this case, which I dislike doing in advance of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.618" offset="3977801">You have invited me, therefore, into what I regard as, from your point of view, a rather undesirable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.244" offset="4008312">I think I made that clear at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.783" offset="4018552">I have told you that, forced by you to look, my views are more extreme than those of the government; and I have also made you realize that if I am required to make Findings and reach Conclusions I am opening up third-party suits that will make, in view of the size of the industry, the percentage of people involved higher than in the electrical cases, is that clear?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.843" offset="4146761">With that state of mind indicated by the Court, the defendants concluded and I think reasonably that there were grounds upon which to petition to disqualify the Court and petitions were filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 144, the text of which Your Honors will find at page 56 on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.344" offset="4248743">On the ground that the trial court had a personal bias or prejudice with respect to the case and in effect had prejudged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.423" offset="4285106">Judge Wyzanski referred the petitions to Judge Woodbury who had especially assigned him to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.531" offset="4309452">And at that point, I entered the trial aspects of the case myself and presented the petition to Judge Woodbury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.220" offset="4348217">Judge Woodbury decided after hearing counsel that the petitions to disqualify were not sufficient under the statute to warrant his disqualification at that time, whereupon shortly thereafter, the trial commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.851" offset="4410807">Now, at the trial which I had the pleasure of observing at least the first day of it, the Government's case which consisted of some 2,500 pages of depositions and another 2,500 pages of documents was received in bulk at the Court's suggestion without ruling on any of the objections to any of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.354" offset="4500773">And the Government's entire case, in this situation was concluded in less than one hour.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.495" offset="4629400">What the Court did was, as the Court assured everybody that the Court would take into consideration whatever evidence the Court later concluded was admissible evidence, and would note in his findings and conclusions whatever he thought is necessary, what evidence he was relying on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.794" offset="5378591">I have no other idea.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.298" offset="5384547">Mr. Fritz - “I have purposely never intended to convey the slightest information of that Your Honor, nor has it been in my mind at anytime, and if I did so, it was certainly inadvertence which I regret very much.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.163" offset="5436061">The Court - “You have made it quite claim to the country at large or at least to this community, that you regarded me as having formed an opinion from someway other than a judge ought to form an opinion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.993" offset="5495306">And there was a comment by Mr. Fritz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.130" offset="5503875">And then the Court said, the Court - “They did not tell the whole story referring to the pretrial hearings which I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.414" offset="5561031">They did not tell the whole story because over my strong reluctance, you insisted that I should hold the case in suspense so that you could confer about a possible settlement and that I could look at the papers with respect to the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.989" offset="5623306">You and I created the difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.020" offset="5635427">Any judge would properly resent being drawn into a situation as a trap and then have the door let loose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.399" offset="5668968">Now if Your Honors will look at the Government's brief at pages 107 and 108 and at 113, you will find that the Government conceives that Judge Wyzanski was factually wrong in material portions of those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.339" offset="5736678">He wasn't -- he had not been reluctant at the time when the pretrial procedures suggested by the handbook, had been recommended in December, and he adopted that he had wasn't reluctant at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.369" offset="5780877">He welcomed it and said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.628" offset="5789863">But now at the beginning of the trial, after the unsuccessful effort to disqualify him, he said that he had been reluctant and we forced him to look at the doctrines, and we forced him to make an opinion, an opinion I might have on the merits, thus becomes clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.739" offset="5854333">There's some further colloquy by -- statement by Mr. Fritz and then the Court said, “You proceeded to disqualify two judges and sought to disqualify the third on the eve of the trial that had been postponed for nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.655" offset="5917968">Your Honors we'll find in the Government brief, page 113, a concession that that statement was not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.613" offset="5949837">The fact is, we had nothing to do with the disqualification of the two prior judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.262" offset="5968436">And the fact is that contrary to what Judge Wyzanski said there, this trial had not been postponed for nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.312" offset="6000619">For some reason, Judge Wyzanski apparently concluded that there was some kind of ‘a plot afoot' to disqualify him by some kind of abuse, I suppose, of the procedures which we invoke in good faith in following the handbook dealing with big cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.800" offset="6378559">But we had carefully, at that time, spelled out and he had carefully spelled out that this was going to be a hypothetical consideration of liability and some tentative indication of what kind of relief might be in order if the Government proved all of its contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.170" offset="6444074">That's what we thought we were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.096" offset="6451806">What happened was he formed a conviction on the merits and on a relief which was unalterable and said that he'd go far, far beyond anything the Government had asked for on relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.911" offset="6495065">And there's nothing can be drawn from his words except to indicate that prior to the commencement of this trial, after the attempted disqualification had failed, by that time, he had a conviction of substantive liability and a punitive frame of mind which denied to us a fair trial thereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.439" offset="6705089">But if the consequence of invoking the statute in good faith is to have the judge become so convicted, so determined on the merits that he has opposed mind, and so punitive as the decree shows, I submit that all in all, the entire transcript compels the conclusion that we did not have a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.285" offset="6776560">I come to the decree itself, the Government concedes that the banishment of Mr. Fleming was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.666" offset="6806026">That banishment by the way was particularly shocking because Judge Wyzanski at the trial have directed a very high praise to Mr. Fleming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.781" offset="6838523">He'd spend a lifetime in this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.073" offset="6847613">He described him as a man of great strength and force of character, and great intellectual ability, and having that kind of quality that's so really admirable and then he turned around and said in this decree, Mr. Fleming shall be banished and shall never work for any of these companies again in his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.194" offset="6908113">Although he was not a defendant, he was merely a witness, at least that's what we thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.630" offset="6921906">Anyway, the Government concedes that that was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.690" offset="6938102">The same punitive approach is reflected in the divestiture provisions of the decree because it's quite clear that we were in this case, Grinnell, only because we acquired ADT in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.220" offset="7000273">I will not take the time of Your Honors to describe the circumstances under which we acquired Grinnell except to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.376" offset="7036844">It came to our attention because a broker said that Western Union's stock was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.399" offset="7052936">We didn't precipitate the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.690" offset="7062131">We bought the stock in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.678" offset="7070072">We made up our minds after a Justice inquiry, that if Justice objected to this, we wouldn't close.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.024" offset="7107480">It was the Department of Justice inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.722" offset="7118242">Justice said thank you very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.003" offset="7127333">Grinnell's counsel advised Grinnell that it was a clearance and they want to have it closed in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.446" offset="7149171">Now, thereafter, 1953 on, the only thing that occurred, Justice Department (Inaudible) its material is -- ADT made an acquisition of a company in Boston called General Alarm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.769" offset="7226493">It was submitted for a clearance and a clearance was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.369" offset="7240808">And a clearance was given by Justice in 1955 even though Justice knew what at the time and recognized that hat would eliminate the only central station competition in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.885" offset="7282918">So if there was something wrong, it was ADT or Grinnell, the Department sure had a chance to say so in 1955 or 1953, and they never said that at either time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Macdonald Flinn</label>
            <text syncTime="1820.685" offset="7386154">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.731" offset="7398275">In 20 minutes, I plan to deal too briefly with the difficult subject of market definition and also with the Government's appeal so far as it seeks additional relief against my client ADT.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.184" offset="7448116">While abandoning the District Court's presumptions of monopolization here, the Government does concede that the sole basis for inferring monopoly power is the fact that the alarm company defendants in 1961 accounted for 87% of the total revenue of accredited central stations including however both insurance approved and unapproved revenue by those stations across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.038" offset="7559502">The Government urges that central station services were correctly found below to constitute a single national market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.899" offset="7594924">Basically, the Government's argument is that ADT operates 115 central stations across the country and that it initially projects target rates so-called minimum basic rates based upon its system wide cost experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.730" offset="7662320">The defendants answered that the commercial realities of the central station business are such that a local market definition is compelled here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.074" offset="7695653">First of all, as Mr. Sonnett noted, central stations can furnish their services only within a radius up to 25 miles of the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.625" offset="7729821">Other than in a few contiguous cities across the country, the result is that a central station in one city is unable to compete with the central station in another city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.524" offset="7769422">Further, the cost of furnishing and the prices obtained for central station services very erratically from one city to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.420" offset="7805053">For example, ADT has obtained average charges for its services which have varied as much as 60% from one city to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.987" offset="7847372">Even where ADT serves some local installations of so-called national accounts which insist that contracts be processed, that there are central headquarters by legal security and insurance departments, those local installations nonetheless have local price estimates computed for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.286" offset="7916544">The prices determined there are response to local competition, local costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.172" offset="7936084">Special national rates or discounts are not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.920" offset="7955101">In such circumstances where customers cannot be supplied from outside their locality and those who furnish services or sell products to them must do so from plants physically situated in the same localities, this Court has long recognized that a local market definition follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.001" offset="10195362">In my oral argument today, Mr. Justice White, I have time to concentrate only on the monopoly aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.428" offset="10217096">We have dealt, however, with the Section 1 restraint of trade contentions in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.263" offset="10236426">They are dealt with even more fully in the briefs of the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.607" offset="10253772">Now if the furnishing of these different end use services by central station firms justifies including all of them in the same market as the Government argues, then we contend that logically it must follow that local alarm services, direct connected alarm services, telephone answering and proprietary alarm systems, all of which use exactly the same systems of electric equipment upon the subscriber's premises should also be included in the market for, as Judge Wyzanski himself found, practically all accredited central stations furnished one or more of these other forms of protection as well as others like watchman service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.590" offset="10413746">In point of fact, the defendants do not make that extreme argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.647" offset="10429942">We do not urge that every dollar of business in every one of these other forms of protection competes for every dollar of accredited central station business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.817" offset="10470588">We do claim however that this record shows that in essentially all of their users, accredited central station services do need effective competition from one or more other forms of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.711" offset="10518235">We claim that even if the Government did not have the burden of proving monopoly, the record here shows the reasonable interchangeability or cross-elasticity of demand required by Cellophane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.259" offset="10568391">I'd like to point out what I believe is the principal difference between the Government and the defendants on this aspect of the case, i.e. whether the market assuming that the different end services can be lumped together, properly excludes all other forms of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.055" offset="10639548">The Government relies solely upon alleged differences, product differentiation between accredited central station services and other forms of protection including unaccredited central stations which furnished the same services but without insurance accreditation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.511" offset="10701406">The briefs of the parties on both sides deal at length with this question, although the Government offers no customer testimony or evidence in support of its views as to the extent of these differences, the only significant view must be that of customers as to how different accredited central stations services and other forms of protection are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.201" offset="10784162">And that customer judgment will be reflected in the degree of cross-elasticity which is the ultimate calculus, the lowest common denominator in a market definition inquiry of the kind which confronts us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.465" offset="10833272">Though the Government refuses to discuss it, evidence of cross-elasticity appears throughout the record here, not only do customers similarly situated consider alternatives and regularly make different elections between accredited central station services and other forms of protection, but a marked price response and sensitivity are shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.884" offset="10918954">If the Court will indulge me, I'd like to deal briefly with some numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.223" offset="10936299">At pages 1801-12 of the printed record, for the City of Indianapolis, the Government has printed a total of 12 ADT competition reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.397" offset="10972975">Their purpose is to show that ADT meets competition only in the form of accredited central stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.833" offset="10998680">These 12 reports, the entire total for the City of Indianapolis selected by the Government here, deal with ADTs having to reduce its prices in competition with American Alarm Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.908" offset="11042983">Now concededly, American Alarm Company today has an accredited central station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.360" offset="11064822">But significantly, 11 of the 12 reports selected by the Government deal with periods of time when American Alarm was not an accredited central station and yet ADT, at these dates in 1957, 1958, 1959, before American became accredited on May 5th, 1960, ADT had to reduce its prices in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.771" offset="11158444">This is the kind of evidence which permeates this record in which the Government has to date refused to discuss and which was totally ignored by Judge Wyzanski.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.043" offset="11195538">These reports contain such illuminating little notations contemporaneously made by ADT salesmen as “We've been loosing customers and old subscribers to the American Alarm Company at an alarming rate because of price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.712" offset="11250186">Now these are the Government's own exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.058" offset="11259591">Looking at these competition reports of ADT on a broader basis, they showed that ADT had to “reduce prices in some 14,000 transactions and negotiations over a roughly eight-year period where --</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.235" offset="11556342">I must turn very quickly to the issue of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.736" offset="11566268">However, I do urge that in our briefs, we have set forth what we think is most convincing evidence of a substantial degree of cross-elasticity of demand here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.013" offset="11603466">We think this is the significant inquiry and should be dispositive on the issue of monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.857" offset="11626768">In its appeal for additional relief, the Government seeks to require ADT's relinquished title to these protection systems which are placed upon subscriber's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.109" offset="11667832">The Government claims that title retention was an important part of the pattern of monopolization that they see here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.870" offset="11694895">The court, however, below made no such finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.514" offset="11705448">To the contrary, the court found that title retention is the norm in the central station business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.326" offset="11724675">As in fact, it is throughout the entire electric protection industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.780" offset="11742542">The briefs by the defendant show what we think are some reasons why all alarm companies in the years passed have kept and have indeed been required by the insurance rating agencies to keep title to these systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.261" offset="11796459">But there is an even better reason why the request of the Government should not be granted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.057" offset="11819551">Requiring subscribers to buy ADT systems will not promote competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.710" offset="11842226">It will merely preclude ADT from competing because competitors not similarly bound can inevitably offer more favorable price terms to subscribers, spreading the cost of the system over the term of their entire relationship with the subscriber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.732" offset="11898337">Now there are many cities where ADT today has only one accredited central station competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.086" offset="11923728">The Government conceives there are many natural monopoly cities where today only one central station can be sustained, but as they grow and become able to sustain a second station, there will be only one competitor there with ADT.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.990" offset="11979316">We ask this Court, is it to the public interest in such circumstances to in effect deprive the public of ADT's competition by in effect locking them out because they are required to sell their systems as a predicate to serving a customer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.691" offset="12130095">I appear here as counsel for Holmes Electric Protective Company, one of the defendants in this case and while I join with counsel for Grinnell and ADT in pointing out that there are errors in both procedure and law and the findings of the court below which require reversing of that decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.850" offset="12246810">My main purpose here is to urge that position of Holmes and irrespective of the outcome of this case, the relief demanded against Holmes is unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.693" offset="12310131">We feel that Holmes has been sucked down the drain by some broad general findings of fact, in which we're only included by a very -- rather a different phrase, defendants or alarm company defendants, and that those -- so many of those findings are not only irrelevant as to Holmes but in the cases where they might apply that the facts are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.255" offset="12440430">So we believe that the relief that is asked against -- the action against Holmes for these reasons which are now discussed should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.516" offset="12493406">Holmes is an old and honorable, and respectable company in the burglary protection business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.143" offset="12523917">It was formed in 1858 by Edwin Holmes, promoter of electric alarm device and by his son who instigated the first telephone service -- exchange, telephone exchange service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.506" offset="12609390">Its business more or less patterned along the line of a telephone company.It installs its burglar alarm system on the devices on the client's premises -- the messages are sent over, released one of the telephone company, and its central station responds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.754" offset="12718373">It was in 1905, Holmes became a subsidiary of the New York Telephone Company and it remained a subsidiary of the New York Telephone Company until 1950 when it was purchased by Grinnell Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.425" offset="12809070">Our testimony is to the effect that the Grinnell Corporation urges this stock as a depression-free investment because it was engaged in supplying a highly evolved building industry and its earnings were very badly affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.611" offset="12877824">And that is born out too by the fact that we, Holmes, sells nothing to Grinnell, it buys nothing from Grinnell, and it has no relationship to Grinnell except from the standpoint of investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.608" offset="12957759">Now it has conducted the business only in the same way since it was organized -- in the same general pattern where it was organized more than 100 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.287" offset="13984475">I would -- I could -- it would be foolish and naïve of me to say that the company couldn't own all the stock of companies and compel them to do what they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.877" offset="14030869">Now, what is the evidence of conspiracy here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.839" offset="14054693">We have first the stock ownership question which we have discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.073" offset="14075695">Now in my -- in my mind, I could be as an instrument of the improper use of power, but there must be some evidence of it and there isn't any with Holmes in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.977" offset="14127313">There's no credible evidence that we conspire with anybody and the only effort to fill that gap is in 1906 agreement between Holmes and ADT which is allegedly illegal and I think probably was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.554" offset="14193560">And if you go back to 1905, a lot of corporate files, you'll find some documents that don't really fit into modern day thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.722" offset="14234311">So I'm not trying to defend that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.114" offset="14243819">But that agreement was terminated in 1947, or in Holmes, it was a subsidiary of New York Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.278" offset="14288436">And there's no evidence in this record that Grinnell ever even knew of that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.273" offset="14332426">They say well, the agreement was terminated but you didn't go into the fire alarm business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.439" offset="14357086">Well, Grinnell for 100 years hadn't been in the fire alarm business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.221" offset="14376208">It didn't want to go into fire alarm business and there's no inference to be drawn from that because as you're going into a new business, as everybody knows, involves the consideration of a lot of very vital economic problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.283" offset="14436498">It involves a little bit of your own knowledge of the business that you're going into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.232" offset="14492296">Then there is a statement I believe -- obtained our position in the market by acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.927" offset="14527091">But the Holmes Electric Company has made no acquisitions in more than 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.242" offset="14552377">And it has, even in the distant past, no record of any substantial acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.161" offset="14580067">It is said that some of the defendants -- the judge says, some of the defendants operated a “loss”, presumably, intended to confer the idea that the “loss” is to keep competition out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.268" offset="14636492">But Holmes never operated a “loss,” that it has never operated a “loss” in any year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.956" offset="14667212">There's no evidence that it ever kept out any competition or that it ever prevented any interest into the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.054" offset="14711620">There's another claim that we had common pricing practices, but I've covered that in the brief and I'm not going into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.821" offset="14750699">I'd like -- do I have -- I believe I have a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.257" offset="14792391">I'd like to go to the penalty provision of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.488" offset="14809318">The divestiture of Holmes was directed by the decree although it was not requested by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.161" offset="14847979">It's not in -- it's not asked or in the complaint, while I realized the broad power of the Court has in fixing the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.656" offset="14882043">I think that these facts which I have shown indicated that that's not necessary to restore competition and probably should be just -- divestiture should not be decreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.242" offset="14956335">Now I won't mention the two provisions in the decree which the Government has conceded error and which have been preferred to (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.642" offset="14989981">There's a prohibition against any acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.269" offset="15004400">Holmes is a small company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.930" offset="15011088">It was bought by Grinnell for $4,256,000 in 1947 for 100% of its stock, such a small fish in the big economic pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.384" offset="15064900">Now we've gather there's a provision in the there that we are forbidden to make any acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.397" offset="15096978">Well, I don't know what posture we'll end up in when this case is over, but a company as small as Holmes ought not to be a burdened with any such restrictive provision as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.224" offset="15152253">Any acquisitions that makes ought to be determined in the light of the competition in the area where it's operated at the time those things are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.894" offset="15198960">The second provision is that -- well, I'll have to rely on my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.847" offset="15218709">My light is on.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Francis Hayden</label>
            <text syncTime="3785.316" offset="15244622">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.811" offset="15262595">I appear here on behalf of the third of the so-called alarm company defendants Automatic Fire Alarm Company of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.509" offset="15301360">That's a company which is not organized until 1920, and thereafter, acquired all the stock of Automatic Fire Alarm Company, a New York corporation which had been in business since 1873.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.650" offset="15365935">Its business was central station fire alarm, automatic fire alarm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.237" offset="15388296">It operates only in three locations -- Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and it has no out of state customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.698" offset="15422151">It has no lines going across state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.879" offset="15442840">Now, Automatic of New York came into the sprinkler business, that is the sprinkler alarm and bell alarm business with these 1907 agreements, the so-called fire alarm agreements that Your Honors will be looking at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.552" offset="15509608">I don't want to attempt in this short argument to discuss much except to mention to you that you'll notice that the old Automatic Fire Alarm Company was involved in those agreements because there was some patent problems with another outlet called Automatic Fire Protection Company and these names may get confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.567" offset="15605635">And that there were some cross-licensing in those agreements whereby my client received a license to use this providence firm's patents in these three cities and we gave them a right, a cross-license, to use our patents anywhere else, and that's how we got involved apparently in the start of what's been called a territorial allocation which goes back before I was born, and there's hardly anyone around could tell us anything about what was really going on then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.658" offset="15734053">In any event, in 1949, Grinnell acquired a controlling interest in Automatic of Delaware that apart from naming a majority of our Board of Directors, they did nothing to change our management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.552" offset="15809599">Now Judge Wyzanski found that apparently they were running our company and that ever proposal that came from Grinnell was accepted by our Board, but even the Government had to admit in a big footnote on their brief, page 82, that he was wrong about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.872" offset="15878875">It was just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.993" offset="15887339">They never overruled any of our management proposals or plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="3960.063" offset="15943659">But that's a matter I want to press on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.051" offset="15955571">Wouldn't you say it's only 90% because we still have 10% represented by some 63 individual minority stockholders and that takes me to another point I want to bring home and that is that when they came to acquire the ADT stock which was a couple of years later, they then had a minority stockholders there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.767" offset="16066435">And you'll find that in this record, it's pretty clear that Grinnell has always very careful, not to be in a position of favoring one of the subsidiaries as against the other because there were two sets of minority stockholders whose interest -- they religiously respect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.703" offset="16138219">Now despite that, despite the unchallenged testimony here that Grinnell really never tried to run this business and tell them how to do it, they weren't in the business at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.621" offset="16181896">They were mainly investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.801" offset="16194539">Judge Wyzanski seemed to find that Grinnell was dominating this and that we are really a tool or a participant in a big national -- nationwide combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.244" offset="16248351">Well, I'm going to ask this Court to take a good look at this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.645" offset="16261935">It's going to take a long time for me to ever try to mention some of the things.</text>

            <text syncTime="4048.902" offset="16299029">The Government has ignored us in their brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4092.115" offset="16471855">There's no question that they had a majority but they didn't use that majority to hurt anybody in the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.662" offset="16506023">It seems to me they were particularly careful and concerned about the interest of the other stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.515" offset="16537475">And then when they got into a conflict between two subsidiaries with different sets, they -- or even more so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.585" offset="16569762">Now, when we set out the questions that we think are involved here, we put the first emphasis on this new rule of law, this presumption of guilt in this case, because we felt that while we subscribed to the arguments of our relevant market in the arguments made here about no fair trial, we think that we weren't held in this case in any way except by the invocation of this new doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.392" offset="16688985">And by throwing us in a bundle with these other corporations without analyzing what we were actually doing, just to give you an example, you'll find that Judge Wyzanski was holding that the alarm company defendants uses that expression, and so does the Government, served more than 900 subscribers across state lines and spent almost $700,000 in one year in interstate telephone line charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.831" offset="16806745">But we didn't have a single customer outside -- across the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.109" offset="16831822">And yet he's using this blanket expression that pulled us in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.633" offset="16849899">Now similarly, and for example, Appendix 39-41, you'll find a long list of items which he thought showed that we were engaged in a national pattern of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.720" offset="16894203">Within that long list, there wasn't any single thing that related to us, except one little thing and that is that we were accredited by national insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.469" offset="16941223">Well now, if we're going to get an interstate character, a nationwide character just because we happen to deal with an insurance company that is a nationwide insurance company, I think we'd be pretty foregone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.980" offset="16995244">I don't see how we could acquire an interstate commerce character in this fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4414.649" offset="17761991">He turns the whole case, I think, in the middle from his words in italics, as something he took out an admission in the brief in counsel's argument that ADT had 20 deficit officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="4509.548" offset="18141602">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.848" offset="18154768">At the outset, I would just like to outline what I propose to cover in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.775" offset="18174516">My argument really is broken down into five points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.581" offset="18185697">First, I would like to state in some greater detail, the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.162" offset="18203982">And then I propose to discuss the relevant market both the product and the geography of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.199" offset="18228120">And then I shall address myself to the substantive violations, then I shall discuss the relief, and finally I shall consider the claim that Judge Wyzanski advised in prejudice and denied the defendants a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.280" offset="18284544">Now coming to the facts basically with the facts involved, are the means by which the defendants acquired and maintained their share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.866" offset="18334804">And we started that it had been indicated back early in the century with a series of restrictive agreements by which the defendants divided up the country in terms of geographic markets and in terms of the services which they were providing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.400" offset="18400946">These agreements by the way, we're not just in formal understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.153" offset="18415992">It's a formal written contract embodying these understandings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.480" offset="18437308">The first one has been referred to as an agreement in 1906 which is known as the burglar alarm agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.315" offset="18464684">That was between ADT and Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.205" offset="18480149">And the -- under this agreement, ADT transferred its burglar alarm business in the Middle Atlantic States of the country to Holmes and agreed that it would not engage in burglar alarm service in those cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.434" offset="18545142">Holmes at the same time agreed that it would restrict itself to burglar alarm cities in those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.702" offset="18578160">Now the next year, was a series of complex agreements which were known locally as the fire alarm agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.295" offset="18608567">The parties to those agreements were Grinnell, which should not been a party to the burglar alarm agreement, ADT, another company whose rights under this agreement ADT acquired six years later in 1911, and AFA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.258" offset="18668440">And the end results of these agreements were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.526" offset="18685471">AFA received the exclusive right to provide certain types of fire alarm services in three cities -- New York, Philadelphia, and Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.309" offset="18736567">And it agreed in turn that it would not engage in the burglar alarm business in those cities, and also that it would stay out of the central station business generally throughout the rest of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.512" offset="18789439">ADT in turn was given the exclusive right except for those services in those cities to provide central station service throughout the United States but of course, that right in turn was qualified by the limitation under the 1906 agreement with Holmes, that ADT would not provide burglar alarm service in those three cities allotted to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.988" offset="18887346">Grinnell agreed to supply certain of the devices which was used in providing the fire alarm service, and in return for this, Grinnell was to receive 25% of the revenues generated by the fire alarm services for which it provided the devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.274" offset="18976475">The fire alarm agreement in terms executed in 1907 was to run until 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.739" offset="19010330">The burglar alarm agreement had no termination date but they were terminated by the parties in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.303" offset="19040632">But the significant thing to us is that after these agreements ended, the parties continued to observe the identical restrictions that had been contained in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.409" offset="19080965">In other words, 17 years after the burglary alarm agreement was terminated, 10 years after the fire alarm agreement ended by its own terms, what we find isn't Judge Wyzanski found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.142" offset="19139897">AFA was continuing to limit itself to fire alarm service into the three cities -- in the three cities in which it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.130" offset="19171871">Holmes was limiting itself to burglar alarm service in the three cities which it had and ADT was freed of the competition of these two companies throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.577" offset="19221713">Now ADT -- AFA -- Mr. -- my colleague is saying that AFA has shown no connection with us, AFA itself has recognized the part these agreements played in helping ADT to develop and gain the share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.529" offset="19301439">In 1954, when these fire alarm agreements terminated, ADT and AFA continued the arrangement they had had for sharing of revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.389" offset="19348877">And some years later, a disagreement arose between the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.447" offset="19365177">ADT was contending that AFA had not contributed enough to the revenues to warrant its share that it was receiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.919" offset="19399032">And in response -- and they wrote a letter to the president of Grinnell, Mr. Fleming, complaining about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.501" offset="19421393">And in response to this, the president of AFA wrote to the president of Grinnell explaining that in fact, this gave a distorted picture of it because AFA had made another contribution, an important contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.068" offset="19475623">Let me read to the Court at record 1484 to 1485, what the president of AFA explains this contribution was and this is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.808" offset="19518568">“The geographic restrictions placed upon us, plus the requirement that we confine our activities to sprinkler and fire alarm service exclusively since 1907 and presumably into the future, has definitely retarded our expansion in the past to the benefit of ADT growth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.143" offset="19603937">Automatic, that's the full name of AFA, is still denied the right of future expansion into existing and new fields of protection services born of normal business progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.606" offset="19653778">Automatic's contribution must also include the many things which help make ADT big and continues to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.273" offset="19688469">So that we think the AFA itself has recognized that one of the most important sources of the power of these companies, that the share -- their share of the market and particularly of ADT's 73% share of the market, where these restrictive agreements which eliminated all competition to point.</text>

            <text syncTime="5428.775" offset="21818493">First, there's something they call the installation charge and then an annual service charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.267" offset="21840436">And the record shows that when ADT found itself in competitive situations, it made very deep slashes in these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.780" offset="21882441">ADT has outstanding instructions to its district sales managers that they may cut in order to meet competitive situations up to 40% of their standard installation charge and up to 20% of their annual service charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.118" offset="21951822">But the record shows that the cuts went much deeper than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.937" offset="21967078">The record shows instances where ADT made installations without any charge, where ADT produced their annual charges by as much as 50% to 70%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.786" offset="22010546">And indeed there were some instances where they combined a 50% to 70% reduction in annual charges with free installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.930" offset="22051088">Now the salesman's reports which ADT required in every case where there was a reduction in the annual charges, installation or annual charges, frequently would refer to the fact that these reductions should be accepted by the home office because of the effect it would have in excluding competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.987" offset="22147323">They pointed out that it was desirable because it would prevent a competitor from gaining a whole access to a particular customer, to a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.964" offset="22183267">And sometimes they stress the fact that by signing a customer up for five years, they kept competitors out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.647" offset="22205942">Let me just read to the Court two or three of these to give the flavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.252" offset="22220361">One salesman suggests in taking a reduction, record 1749, in order to keep competitor out of this growing chain, another one, we were most anxious to block Robinson's first move into Camden, and another one competitor is very anxious to get a foothold in this building of wholesale (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.446" offset="22301132">And I think particularly revealing, it's a document in the record, a statement in 1956 by a vice president of ADT, explaining why they had decided to renew a contract with RKO Studios in Hollywood for 10 years at a reduction in the previous charges, and he explained it as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5570.735" offset="22386291">This is 2118 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.027" offset="22395486">He said, “If this was the best deal possible, we would take it in order to keep Morris --,” that's another central service station, “-- in order to keep Morris out of the motion picture studio business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.300" offset="22444596">If the Morris people got RKO Studios, one of the majors, they would have their foot in the door so to speak and would have a weapon to use in soliciting other studios.</text>

            <text syncTime="5788.250" offset="23256377">That's right and this does of course get into the question which I will turn to in a minute, relevant both to the product market and the geographical market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.326" offset="23288665">Now I'd just briefly like to refer to one or two other instances of means which have enabled ADT to retain its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.081" offset="23331715">There are in this record a few instances, not many, of cases where ADT actually threatened competitors that it would bring to bear its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.620" offset="23369853">We've cited in our brief three or four of them and they've suggested that if a competing company didn't behave itself, they could bring to bear this enormous and economic power that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.973" offset="23415306">There are few other instances where ADT has opened a new central service station and the record shows that one of the principal reasons for that was because they believe this would have the effect of blocking a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5840.987" offset="23467342">Now there's also reference to the question of retaining title to the installations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5848.387" offset="23496913">The significance of that is tied up with the way in which this service is sold, that is its price is composed of a combination of an installation charge and a service charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.742" offset="23554382">Because at the end of the five-year contract, if a customer is dissatisfied with ADT and would like to go to someone else or if someone else offers them a cheaper arrangement, ADT if it loses the business, removes all of the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.816" offset="23614673">And this means that a competing seller of this service has to quote the customer a double charge, an installation charge plus a service charge whereas ADT, if it continues merely has the service charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5895.028" offset="23683532">And there is indication of at least two people who testified to central service station operators that they found it very difficult and sometimes almost impossible to try to solicit existing customers of ADT for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.965" offset="23747271">Now this is the background, I'd like to turn to the definition of the market which I think we agree with the defendants is the critical issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.074" offset="23787708">And I'd like to discuss first the relevant product market and secondly, the relevant geographical market.</text>

            <text syncTime="5948.390" offset="23896900">No, it's not in the record, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.977" offset="23915290">We're dealing here of course with -- the product we're dealing here is the service, protecting people against hazards giving them warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.759" offset="23946428">And in numerous respects, the so-called accredited central station service we think is noticeably superior to other forms of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.168" offset="23988015">There are two particular aspects of this I'd like to stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.274" offset="24004420">The first thing is that only this type of service gives a warning not only of the hazard but also of some malfunctioning of the equipment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.071" offset="24051649">In other words, it's not enough to have on the plant -- on the premises of burglar alarm system if in fact when a burglar breaks in it's not going to ring.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.505" offset="24093341">And ordinarily, you don't know, there maybe something wrong with the circuit, there maybe -- parts may have worn out or so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.035" offset="24119463">Similarly, you could have a splendid sprinkler alarm system, but if there's a fire and the sprinkler heads don't go off, the water pressure isn't adequate, it doesn't do you any good.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.868" offset="24154885">Now this system is -- these systems are devised so that they give a signal not only if there's a fire, that is if the sprinkler goes off or if there's an attack on the premises, but also if there's any malfunctioning in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.926" offset="24207026">Now you have protection here, a double protection, you're protected against hazard and you're also protected against the possibility that the system will not work at a critical time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.624" offset="24257912">Now there's another respect to which this system is very important and very desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6043.889" offset="24278915">That is that this really is the only kind of a system that gives the customer any guarantee that in the event of alarm, something is going to be done about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.582" offset="24325726">Under the certification procedures which I'll come to in a moment, in order to be accredited, a central station has to meet a lot of different tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="6064.997" offset="24363342">And one requirement is, that there'd be available on the premises at all times, a sufficient number of trained personnel to be able to respond to an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="6075.806" offset="24406601">And when an alarm comes in, you know these people will respond and will do it promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.784" offset="24426559">On the other hand, some of these other systems that are involved don't give this guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6085.662" offset="24445994">For example, a burglar alarm, they ring in the middle of town, in the middle of the morning, perhaps someone will come around and do something, perhaps someone won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6094.030" offset="24479535">There's also -- there's another type of service they have where they connect the alarm system to either of the police headquarters or fire department.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.413" offset="24513076">But these indications are frequently, as these alarms come in, the police may not immediately respond to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6108.800" offset="24538572">They may say, “Oh, we've had a lot of things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.141" offset="24547976">For example, apparently, a heavy windstorm, the glass may shake and that maybe enough to activate an alarm.</text>
            <text syncTime="6117.795" offset="24574516">Well, these people can tell what the cause is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.741" offset="24586324">The police may say, “Oh, we had too much stuff like that recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.842" offset="24602728">We're not going to do anything about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.477" offset="24613282">Now, the one group it would seem to me that is preeminently qualified to evaluate the quality of these systems is the insurance industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.798" offset="24650585">That's their business -- evaluating hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="6139.991" offset="24663333">And that industry has clearly recognized the superior quality of these systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="6146.376" offset="24688828">That the Underwriters Laboratories and various rating bureaus have promulgated very detailed standards governing all aspects of central station service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.807" offset="24730624">It involves the kind of a building they must have, the kind of equipment they must have, the number of personnel available, their requirements for different classes of service that the guards must be able to reach the spot within a certain period of time, and also, a very detailed requirement as to precisely the kind of equipment and the kind of protection on the subscriber's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="6180.307" offset="24824560">There are two aspects to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6182.378" offset="24832920">The first thing is the central station itself must be approved by the insurance underwriters to become a certificated -- a certified station.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.799" offset="24878582">And after that, the next step is that the central station in turn can grant accreditation to a particular installation of the subscriber.</text>
            <text syncTime="6205.629" offset="24925915">Now, accredited service generally qualifies for larger discounts on insurance than non-accredited service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.805" offset="24966562">And this seems to us is the clearest example of the high regard which the insurance company has for this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6223.336" offset="24996760">Indeed, the evidence indicates that in the field of burglar alarms, roughly one half of the subscribers, little more little less, do not get a certificate for their own installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6236.996" offset="25051408">They go and get service from an accredited company but they do not pay the additional amount which is necessary to get the special types of protection, a broader coverage which the certificate gives.</text>
            <text syncTime="6250.985" offset="25107310">Well, this it seems to us, and therefore they are not eligible -- not be eligible for the discounts on this, this it seems to us indicates that these customers recognized the advantages in having service provided by an accredited company even though they don't get the discounts that would be available if they went a step beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="6269.813" offset="25182647">Now the record also indicates, that frequently, insurance companies have insisted that subscribers get accredited service before they're willing to give them any insurance coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.900" offset="25234996">Another example we think of the customer recognition of the superiority of this service is the District Court's finding that when customers do shift from one type of service to the other, the preponderance shift is equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.411" offset="25297063">The preponderance shift is from the other forms of service to this particular type of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.786" offset="25322559">In other words, we don't have customers as you might expect if the services were relatively immaterial to them in terms of quality and they were motivated primarily by price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.978" offset="25363310">We don't have customers generally shifting back and forth here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.112" offset="25375848">Generally, they start with one and when they shift, they shift to what they obviously consider to be the superior service because they are paying more for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6450.976" offset="25907284">But the quite issue in defining the market under the antitrust laws is that what point you cut off the substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.489" offset="25937377">Now, it seems to me -- I mean the Court suggested in Cellophane, its reasonable interchangeability -- use, quality, and price considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.410" offset="25973008">I mean it is a vague thing, there are no hard and fast lines, it's a matter of degree obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="6473.549" offset="25997563">But in this case, the District Court, we think, was justified in concluding that in view of the various distinctions between these type of products that the accredited central station service is an appropriate market for testing the existence of monopoly power.</text>

            <text syncTime="6537.754" offset="26254399">For example, if I may refer to the International Boxing case, I suppose, if someone was deciding what fights he was going to go to, once he found the price of the ticket to a championship bout was too high, he might be willing to settle for a non-championship bout.</text>
            <text syncTime="6554.124" offset="26319914">And yet, this Court upheld in International Boxing the findings that the championship professional boxing was a separate segment of the market because of the various factors which indicated that it was viewed in the commercial world as having sufficiently distinct characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="6572.549" offset="26393579">It had -- it was different enough to the customer that it was not -- it would not -- let's put it this way.</text>

            <text syncTime="6585.226" offset="26444257">It was appropriate to just look to this product and know there wasn't sufficient interchangeability that you had to include the other products.</text>

            <text syncTime="6658.579" offset="26737664">The other side of the coin, our opponents claim, we've drawn the market too broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6663.076" offset="26755636">They say we have no business including such disparate services as burglary alarm and fire alarm in the same market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6672.267" offset="26792417">Now the -- we think here that the market, the business here is providing warnings and protection against hazard through a central station of service -- central station service.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="6685.692" offset="26846124">Accredited central station, yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="6688.146" offset="26855946">When I say central station service, if I inadvertently leave out the word accredited, I hope the Court will realize that I mean accredited whenever I neglect to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6699.380" offset="26900877">Now generally speaking, generally speaking, most central stations do provide or offer to provide this wide variety of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="6709.253" offset="26940374">There are two of course that don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6711.406" offset="26949047">Holmes provides only burglary alarm service, AFA provides only fire alarm service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6716.677" offset="26970049">The reason they limit themselves is because under these old agreements, that's exactly what they agreed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6722.887" offset="26994918">They agreed to stay in their particular type of market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.822" offset="27018637">The services are frequently provided together.</text>
            <text syncTime="6731.299" offset="27028564">Customers frequently want a full scope of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6734.901" offset="27042983">And we think that in these circumstances, it was proper to include the whole market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6741.478" offset="27069315">In the Philadelphia Bank case which was of course a case under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, the Court pleaded commercial banking as the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6750.047" offset="27103587">Well, just as the people could -- they argued here that someone who wants burglar alarm service isn't satisfied with fire alarm service so somebody who wishes to negotiate a commercial loan with a bank isn't satisfied by being told that the bank will be glad to handle his trust business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6767.712" offset="27174222">Now if you look at the whole business, you see the way the business is conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6771.497" offset="27189373">And here, basically, the business has conducted except for these two companies which were restricted on boarder line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6778.244" offset="27216332">Now in the time remaining this afternoon, I'd like to turn to the question of the geographic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6784.081" offset="27239737">That is whether the District Court as we think properly treated the geographic market as national in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="6792.903" offset="27274951">We start with the fact that Holmes has 73% of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6799.054" offset="27299610">It has most of the business in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6803.057" offset="27315597">And -- I'm sorry, ADT has 73% of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6807.652" offset="27333987">I misspoke myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6809.279" offset="27340466">And ADT, we think, plainly does operate its business on a national basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6816.502" offset="27369409">It's true as they say that these limitations of a central station are such that it cannot operate within a radius of more than 25 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6827.733" offset="27414340">And we know that the obvious point that if I'm in Washington and I'm not satisfied with the service, I can't call a firm in New York and ask me to supply them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6836.748" offset="27450389">On the other hand, we're dealing here with the problem of whether these people have the power -- have the power over the market to control prices and exclude competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.872" offset="27502843">And it's ADT which has the lion share of the market that does operate on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.098" offset="27527816">It fixes its rates on a system wide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6859.215" offset="27540250">It fixes its rate as I've indicated in order to try to obtain a certain rate of return on its overall operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6866.087" offset="27567731">And even in those areas where it has competition from other accredited central stations, it does not attempt to set a lower rate for that particular city or area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.161" offset="27616005">All that it does is it deals with individual competitive situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.492" offset="27637321">Individual competitive situations will reduce the price in order to meet the particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6889.803" offset="27662608">And another illustration of the way in which they operate in a national budget is the one so-called national accounts.These might be chain stores, department stores with whom ADT does business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.172" offset="27716106">These national accounts like to arrange for their protection services through their home office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6909.043" offset="27739512">Only ADT, which operates throughout the country in 115 different cities, is able to provide this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6916.853" offset="27770755">Only ADT can come in and say, “Yes, we will handle your service throughout the country.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6921.762" offset="27790399">And there are a large number of firms, in particular, localities that testified that they were unable to get the business of these large national concerns in their locality because they were told, this is all handled through the home office and ADT has it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6940.142" offset="27863960">Other respects in which ADT operates on a nationwide basis include the distribution to its central stations of equipment which it either manufactures or purchases, it conducts research of the system as a whole, and there is of course a constant stream of communications back and forth, personnel from the home office going out to the various areas, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6965.676" offset="27966046">The short of it is that ADT which has three-quarters of the business, operates throughout the country, and it runs its business on a national basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.050" offset="28015574">And as I've previously indicated a major reason, ADT was able to operate nationwide and grow on the scale was because it was freed from the competition of the two other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6990.291" offset="28064580">And we think that in determining whether the defendants have monopolized this business, it is appropriate to make this inquiry and to apply the standards to the way in which the leading company that has most of the business operates, because this seems to us is a fair test of the way in which they operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7009.045" offset="28139604">And as I shall come to you tomorrow, we do have the -- all of these things shown that ADT is able to bring to bear its economic power in a way that none of the other firms can.</text>
            <text syncTime="7021.426" offset="28189027">And it is operating on a national basis and we therefore believe that that is the appropriate way in which its power should be tested.</text>
