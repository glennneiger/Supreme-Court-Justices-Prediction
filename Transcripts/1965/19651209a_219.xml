            <label>Mr. Leon B. Polsky</label>
            <text syncTime="12.128" offset="151907">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.024" offset="167476">Essentially, this case involves the question of the rights to be awarded to the mentally ill and the procedures whereby their mental illness is determined and they are placed in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.126" offset="239888">Mr. Baxstrom was convicted of a crime in the State of New York and he received a sentence of two-and-a-half to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.411" offset="288998">After completing service of that sentence, he was committed to the state hospital where he presently is in custody having served far in excess of the original criminal sentence which was imposed on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.757" offset="378441">At the time of his commitment, he appeared before the Surrogate's Court in Clinton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.050" offset="407594">He received notice that a commitment proceeding was being instituted against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.150" offset="431940">He was afforded a hearing of sorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.921" offset="447091">He was not offered counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.812" offset="454614">He was not represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.949" offset="471124">And he took no real part in the proceedings other than to indicate that he did not believe he belonged in the institution to which he was going to dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.610" offset="525772">Thereafter, he sued out several writs of habeas corpus, the last of which has reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.586" offset="569762">We claim that the commitment of the petitioner after the exploration of this criminal sentence was the kind of proceeding to which the right to counsel attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.451" offset="633187">We claim this as a right to counsel under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.939" offset="651160">We claim this right to counsel as a specific incident to the due process right to notice and hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.049" offset="691597">We maintain that there is no hearing and can be no hearing in a case of this type if the man is not represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.880" offset="738931">Looking specifically at the record which shows the kind of commitment proceeding we have in this case, Mr. Baxstrom was given notice that he was going to appear in the Surrogate's Court on December 6, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.843" offset="814791">He appeared there without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.705" offset="826180">The trial judge had already read the certificates of two physicians who were independent of the hospital and when the state law had examined him.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.105" offset="871842">Neither those physicians testified at this hearing, yet their certificates were instrumental in having Mr. Baxstrom committed and their certificates with the basis upon which the finding of mental illness was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.755" offset="954389">In their certificates, two physicians stated that Mr. Baxstrom possibly had a tendency to be dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.369" offset="1000887">I am not certain what this means but I certainly would hope that had there been an attorney there to represent Mr. Baxstrom at this commitment, he might have developed that possibly has a tendency to be dangerous is not a committable state of being in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.370" offset="1092838">In a subsequent habeas corpus hearing, a position testified that he had examined petitioner and found basically that the petitioner was an epileptic and diagnosed, there was no objective sign of this but he diagnosed that there might be brain damage or brain deterioration flowing from the epilepsy and then he described Baxstrom's condition that the patient was irritable, confused, and aggressive after his epileptic seizures like all other epileptics.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.362" offset="1264828">Now, I am not trying to re-litigate or litigate because this has never been litigated, the question of whether this man is or is not insane or, was or was not insane.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.291" offset="1656560">So, there is that first question of whether or not this new procedure or service is available to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.115" offset="2151842">Now, as I understand the State's arguments in answer to our contentions, they say on the one hand this is a civil proceeding and the right to counsel doesn't apply to civil proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.325" offset="2212655">And then they say in response to our other arguments dealing with the constitutionality of the several statutes involved that those statutes are not unconstitutional because here we're dealing with the criminally insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.297" offset="2272528">Now, it seems to me the State is taking rather ambivalent position.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.767" offset="2294471">We lose on the right to counsel because this is a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.739" offset="2314324">We lose on the right to a jury trial and to the patient's right to have a broader determination of whether he should be in an institution such as Dannemora because that is a criminal kind of proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.910" offset="2387048">Now quite frankly, essentially, we are dealing with statutes which have been amended and re-amended and re-amended from time in memorial.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.424" offset="2429053">The people who are involved in these cases are people who, quite frankly, no one has ever really cared about one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.459" offset="2465207">The statutes have grown up as hotchpotch statutes to meet specific situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.700" offset="2490180">Each time a court decides a case, a statute gets amended but never in relation to the overall picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.565" offset="2525602">In this case, while I could limit this case to very specific instances of prejudice which are demonstrated at this point, we feel that we are entitled to ask that people subject to this kind of awful imprisonment, well that is what it is, should have some minimum safeguards attached to their custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.614" offset="2657782">I cannot see how Mr. Baxstrom could be entitled to the full scope of the Constitution when he was charged with assault in the second degree and was sentenced to two-and-a-half to three years imprisonment and now that he -- and not have at least something close to those rights when the State seeks to put him away from what essentially is going to be the rest of his life.</text>
