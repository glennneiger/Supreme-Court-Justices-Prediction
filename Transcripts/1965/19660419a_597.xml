            <text syncTime="132.758" offset="634441">On November 6 of 1962, a municipal election was held in Birmingham to determine whether the existing commission form of city government would be retained or would be replaced by the so-called mayor-council form.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.805" offset="710614">Mr. Mills authored an editorial which was published on election day in his newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.087" offset="743737">The editorial appears in full on page 25 of the record and as Appendix K on page 35 of the appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.103" offset="783757">In this editorial, Mr. Mills criticized the then mayor of Birmingham for promising pay raises to city employees and for saying that he would instruct city employees to neither give out news to nor discuss with reporters of the Birmingham Post-Herald, or its sister paper, the Birmingham News, any public business.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.623" offset="893889">The Mills editorial stated that the proposed pay raises were -- was another good reason why the voter should vote overwhelmingly today in favor of mayor-council government.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.349" offset="956792">As to the news blackout threatened by the mayor, the editorial comment was, if Mayor Hanes displays such arrogant disregard of the public right to know on the eve of election, what can we expect in the future if the city commission should be retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.902" offset="1030980">Birmingham and the people of Birmingham deserve a better break.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.459" offset="1049161">A vote for mayor-council government will give it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.360" offset="1068805">The publication of this editorial marked the beginning of the chain of events ultimately leading to our appearance here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.518" offset="1109452">A criminal complaint was filed against Mr. Mills on November the 13th, 1962 issued from the Jefferson County Criminal Court charging Mills, head by the editorial in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.343" offset="1164727">Electioneered or solicited votes on election day in contravention of Section 285 of the Alabama Corrupt Practices Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.202" offset="1208195">If guilty of this misdemeanor as charged, Mr. Mills is subject to a fine of not more than $500 and he may also be imprisoned in the county jail or sentenced at hard labor for six months, but not more than six months on behalf of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.726" offset="1306311">Demurrers to the complaint were filed on Mills' behalf, testing the constitutionality of the statute as applied to the editorial on both the Alabama and the federal constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.757" offset="1366392">The lower court -- the criminal court sustained these demurrers thereby, in effect, declaring the statute as applied unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.857" offset="1482794">The statute having been declared unconstitutional, as provided by Alabama procedure, the State appealed directly to the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.606" offset="1533785">Reversing the judgment of the trial court, the Supreme Court of Alabama held that Section 285 clearly applied to the Mills editorial and that the statute as applied was constitutional under the police powers for the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.898" offset="1614973">The order of the court remanded the case to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.483" offset="1633259">We filed a timely application on behalf of Mr. Mills and this was overruled by the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.289" offset="1664502">Mills then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States and this Court by its order of December the 6th, 1965, postponed jurisdiction for further consideration to the hearing of the case on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.948" offset="1739212">Under those circumstances, we will address ourselves first to the question of this Court's jurisdiction, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.295" offset="1780590">The jurisdictional issue in this case arises because on its phase, the judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court does not necessarily conclude the litigation between the State of Alabama and Mr. Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.491" offset="1849344">Alabama procedure would permit Mills on an actual trial of the case below to interpose defenses other than the unconstitutionality of the statute in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.111" offset="1915800">In reality, however, Mills has no other defense either in fact or in law to the charge against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.708" offset="1962193">He freely concedes that he wrote the editorial complained of and caused it to be published on election day.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.213" offset="1996257">And the Alabama Supreme Court specifically held that this constituted a violation of the statute and the statute as thus applied is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.226" offset="2036276">Therefore, may it please the Court, the federal question, that is the constitutionality or not of the Alabama statute is the only question remaining in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.206" offset="2092178">There is nothing more to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.282" offset="2104508">Under these circumstances, the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court constituted a final judgment for the purposes of Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.567" offset="2161664">In the case of Pope versus Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company which was decided by this Court in 1953, a railroad employee invoking the Federal Employers Liability Act sued his employee -- employer for injury sustained in the course of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.709" offset="2238255">The injuries occurred in Georgia but the employee sued in the Alabama courts and the railroad filed a proceeding to restrain the Alabama action.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.601" offset="2281827">The trial court sustained the general demurrer which raised the provisions of the federal statute as a bar for the power of the Georgia Court to issue the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.211" offset="2332191">The Georgia Supreme Court reversed the trial court's order and the employee appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.883" offset="2370853">As an out case, the jurisdictional question in Pope was whether or not the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.783" offset="2418500">The Supreme Court held that it was a final judgment because the issue was right for adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="1834.185" offset="7440071">And this statute was struck down under the guise of regulating conduct, those statutes regulated free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.573" offset="7481657">Now, that's exactly what is happening in the Alabama statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.372" offset="7508825">It would be only of small step from the Alabama Supreme Court's decision in the Mills case to say -- well, for a benevolent legislature to say well it would be in the interest of the public, we think, in this -- in times of trouble and stress such as we are now enduring, it would be in the public interest that there'd be some surcease, some respite from all of these tension, all of the bad news.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.069" offset="7715610">This is the danger of the Mills case that's decided by Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.861" offset="7814771">This Court, this is the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.896" offset="7826996">This Court holds in accordance with the great weight of authority that a law cannot be held to be invalid because unreasonable unless and until it appears beyond reasonable controversy that it necessarily impairs to the point of practical destruction, a right safeguarded by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.839" offset="7918738">As it already has been pointed out, the law under consideration lies within the police power field and impairs, and please listen -- and impairs only the right of free expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.255" offset="7972342">Now, by whatever theory or by whatever rationale this decision is tested, we think that the Alabama statute as applied to Mr. Mills was faux.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.917" offset="8026990">The Alabama Supreme Court and this is fundamentally objectionable, is that -- is the assumption by the Court that the State has the power to provide the voters of Alabama an intellectually, antiseptic atmosphere on election day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.210" offset="8104208">This is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.666" offset="8114030">This is a monstrous assumption, if you will, in a free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.327" offset="8136704">This is the danger of the Mills case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.253" offset="8152377">The gradual, by slow degrees, encroachment on First Amendment rights by the states or by the Congress, it should not be tolerated except in very clear cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.060" offset="8219564">And then as this Court has pointed out in the Roth case, the door should be left ajar only for the purpose of restricting what have to be restricted in the public interest, and then the door should be tightly closed because the matter of free expression is not just free expression, it is the essence as this Court has recognized, it is the essence of self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.208" offset="8356237">And we ask that the Court take jurisdiction and then it reversed the Alabama Supreme Court, my colleague, Mr. Perrine will argue the vagueness objection to the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3627.220" offset="14612250">Of course, those -- all those laws were passed to give the elector a right to go to the polls unmolested, undisturbed, and vote his choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.814" offset="14670660">Now, the question here is whether or not this statute prohibiting all electioneering and solicitation on an election day transcends the right of a legislature to put certain reasonable restraints on the Constitution, the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.458" offset="14777240">So we get right down to the mead of it, to ask ourselves, is it a reasonable regulation?</text>

            <text syncTime="4611.701" offset="18550157">Now, there are some questions here about -- on jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.530" offset="18573458">I think Your Honor that this Court should render an authoritative decision on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.409" offset="18613060">It's of vital importance to the people of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.338" offset="18628733">And if we went back through the courts, I can tell you what I think would happen in the face of the Supreme Court's decision although there is a trial de novo, I think if an evidence was, as presented to you here, the Court would give a request in favor of the State under a general charge, that if they believe that they would have to convict Mr. Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.780" offset="18734477">So now in this type of a statute, in any complaint or sworn affidavit or indictment, the facts alleging a solicitation or the electioneering would necessarily have to be in that complaint or sworn affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.997" offset="18847326">And I think if any person, prosecuting attorney or anyone else attempted to use the statute in a -- and under the facts that wouldn't constitute solicitation or demurrer filed to the indictment, a demurrer filed to the complaint raising a question that it does not constitute a violation of the law under the State of Alabama, the courts would have a review of the conduct of the individual to determine whether or not the Court in its opinion thought that this alleged, where it might be who was accused of violating it, did electioneer or solicit votes for an individual or candidate on election day.</text>

            <text syncTime="4745.587" offset="19085772">As I recall Alabama, it does not have a provision in the Constitution which makes the jury the judge who brought the law in facts and criminal libel cases, does it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Alfred Swedlaw</label>
            <text syncTime="4798.611" offset="19297782">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.927" offset="19307081">In rebuttal, Mr. Hawkins has stated that in his judgment, various acts which the statute by its terms proscribed would not be so construed and would not be -- this is not the intendment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.385" offset="19392867">The language of the statute is clear in these various respects and this, this is one of the faults, the vagueness fault in the statute that it brings within its ambit and within its purview otherwise harmless conduct and proscribes it and makes it a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.356" offset="19472802">The statute does not require that it'd be done with a criminal intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.408" offset="19488998">The statute says thus and so shall be forbidden on election day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.765" offset="19518464">Now, one of the concerns of the State apparently and Mr. Hawkins has expressed here and I think that this paternalistic attitude is permeated in the State's position throughout these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.602" offset="19569768">Questionably, the right of the public to be protected, Mr. Hawkins said that he thought that one of the purposes would be to prevent a voter from forming a role and opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.163" offset="19616057">Now, this is precisely -- this is precisely the thought -- that sort of thing that we are urging on the Court here to take cognizance of the fact that this is not a legislative interest that the State has a right to protect, Thornhill decided that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.914" offset="19687006">Thornhill decided that -- the fact that people might be persuaded to take the position contrary to their best interest or to adopt an indirect opinion are not dangers which government has any right to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.015" offset="19759417">The antiseptic atmosphere of an election is not something that is a matter of legislative interest -- legitimate legislative interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.952" offset="19795153">There's nothing it says we need to have peaceful, and calm, and tranquil atmospheres on election day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.448" offset="19829112">We must defend out -- like to speak out robustly as the State has said, even to the point -- as this Court has said, even to the point of criminal libel unless done with malice as this Court held in the Garrison case with regard to public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.215" offset="19912182">If the Court will permit with the remaining time we have at hand, we should like to revert to the question of jurisdiction notwithstanding that the State is in effect graciously conceded that it makes no issue of the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.159" offset="19976025">But since a state in its brief has made certain comments and distinctions, for example the State has made much of the -- of an alleged distinction on the finality question between the Pope case, for example, in our case and that this case is a criminal procedure whereas in Pope, criminality was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.770" offset="20070484">We submit that if there is any such distinction, it lies in favor of the appellant in this case for the reason that it's of much more pertinence, much more concerned that this man, that Mr. Mills not be subjected to a criminal trial and risk having a conviction against his record in order to test his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.163" offset="20176018">The distinction is not made in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.217" offset="20184273">Section 1257 requires no distinction such as the State would urge between criminal and civil proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.330" offset="20220740">Now, the State also relies on the Polakow case which was decided by the Supreme Court on a writ of certiorari, not decided, the writ of certiorari was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.784" offset="20278523">And in Polakow, there was involved the procedure of indictment against certain persons in Alabama for selling real estate without a license as prescribed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.322" offset="20340694">The constitutionality of this statute was likewise tested by demurrer and the matter went to the Supreme Court on certiorari but the Supreme Court denied the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.775" offset="20386461">Now, the distinction between the Polakow case and the case involved is a fraud that appears in Polakow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.838" offset="20414673">The defendant there had other defenses to interpose in a trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.361" offset="20444766">That is not true as we have pointed out in the case involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.626" offset="20461902">Moreover, the Court has moved away from Polakow to the point that it maybe said that Polakow has by being ignored been overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.303" offset="20508609">The Pope case, the Richfield case, the Curry case have all departed at least implicitly from the Polakow holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.741" offset="20558346">And this Court has recognized that the threat of sanctions, the threat of First Amendment restrictions, can even more or can almost as much as the imposition of the sanctions themselves infringe upon constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.483" offset="20653328">As late as last month in the Fanny Hill case, for example, this Court in passing on the -- on its jurisdiction in the -- on the Massachusetts proceedings, in which there had been an in rem declaration of obscenity against the Fanny Hill book but there had been no prosecution, there'd been no criminal trial, been no criminal conviction albeit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.486" offset="20781328">But this Court noted that the declaration of obscenity is likely to have a serious inhibitory effect on the distribution of the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.134" offset="20819884">And that this probable effect is in no small measure derived from the possible collateral uses of the declaration in subsequent prosecution under the Massachusetts statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="5258.105" offset="21135757">The freedom of expression is now seriously impaired just as this Court felt that it would be in Massachusetts although no criminal prosecutions had actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.621" offset="21177866">And it might be said in conclusion.</text>
