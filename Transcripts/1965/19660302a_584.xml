            <text syncTime="19.332" offset="182794">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.925" offset="209126">This case presents with perhaps more poignancy than any of the others that had previously been argued this week.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.324" offset="250713">It's a problem of determining the scope of the investigative powers of the police in the exercise of their function as guardians of society and determining the scope of the constitutional rights of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.180" offset="326154">Beginning in December 1962, and continuing through January 1963, there occurred in a limited area of the City of Los Angeles a series of extremely brutal crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.602" offset="399820">A lady named Mrs. Wells on her way home from work on December 21, 1962 was waylaid, robbed, brutally beaten by an unknown assailant who made of with her purse and its contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.976" offset="465335">Later on with Mrs. Dixon and the same thing occurred to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.292" offset="490621">Mrs. Mitchell was waylaid near her home and struck down and killed and her possessions were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.840" offset="520819">Mrs. Miyauchi on her way to work in the early morning was similarly accosted and her possession is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.561" offset="551643">And finally, a Miss Ramirez on the day before the arrest of the respondent here, suffered to similar occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.240" offset="586334">In the case of Mrs. Mitchell, the victim died.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.759" offset="600440">And the case of the other victims, they suffered long hospitalization periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.392" offset="626981">They were fractured skulls, fractured jaws, losses of equilibrium, and certainly an inability to identify the perpetrator of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.567" offset="671702">Whoever this person was, he made one mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.632" offset="691973">With the assistance of a lady named Lena Franklin, he negotiated some checks which had been stolen from Mrs. Wells at a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.010" offset="725410">This occurred on the 22nd of January 1963, the negotiation of the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.065" offset="749652">On the 30th, the officers learned that he had done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.783" offset="764594">On the 31st, they located Lena Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.251" offset="778386">Upon locating her they went with her to find the person who has been introduced to her as Roy Wells, the person who cashed the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.957" offset="817256">She did not know the address.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.768" offset="824466">She did know what the house had looked like because she'd been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.082" offset="837736">They went there.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.003" offset="841394">They saw the respondent on the front porch.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.907" offset="853096">They called out his name, Roy Wells, the name he'd signed to the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.789" offset="868561">He went inside the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.537" offset="875562">They followed him, they entered, they arrested him for a series of purse snatch robberies, and they came upon [Inaudible].</text>

            <text syncTime="204.673" offset="924150">I'm sorry, Your Honor if I -- I have a habit of not knowing whether I'm talking loud enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.058" offset="957691">Upon entering the house and searching it, incident to the arrest which was a lawfully arrest and it has never been challenge, the officers found a great deal of stolen property.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.916" offset="1001054">They found particular items of property which have been taken from each of the individual victims with the robbery or murder at home, that the respondent here was subsequently charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.328" offset="1050687">In addition, according to the testimony of the arresting officers, they found a number of other purses and a number of other wallets whose providence is not identified in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.894" offset="1096976">In the house were five persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.723" offset="1108261">The respondent Stewart, his mistress or wife as the case maybe, his niece, a lady named Jacky Jackson, and two other gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.735" offset="1148385">At the time of this arrest, search and seizure, the officers had no means of knowing other than perhaps a bland suspicion perhaps, that the same person had committed all these offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.243" offset="1210347">They had no means of knowing that this was not a ring of the five people who were all in this house at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.440" offset="1239186">And this is certainly different than the type of situation envisioned by the Chief Justice yesterday where the police get a vague description of somebody and pick up 90 people who looked like them and take them down to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.962" offset="1289237">So these persons were taken, arrested, taken to the police station.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.965" offset="1317240">That's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.331" offset="1322778">The defendant Stewart, Lillian Lara, a man named Burnam, a man named Evans, Jacky Jackson, the niece of the defendant Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.081" offset="1365723">During the ensuing five days, before the production of Stewart before a magistrate, he was questioned as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.514" offset="1399474">The record shows also the amount and the length of the questioning, approximately a total of two hours and 45 minutes or two hours and 46 minutes as the case maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.898" offset="1445031">This was the total amount of the questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.871" offset="1456943">There's no claim here he was questioned at late hours continually by relays of police.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.622" offset="1483901">There's no claim here that he was denied access to anybody he wanted to see whether a wife, or a friend, or a relative, or counsel, or bondsman or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.836" offset="1528728">There was indeed a claim of coercion at the trial, a claim which was I would suggest devoid of substance.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_ringer" startTime="367.556" stopTime="666.193">
            <label>Mr. Gordon Ringer</label>
            <text syncTime="367.556" offset="1575643">It is devoid of substance, a claim solely that the common law – that the confession by the defendant was given in return for a promise to release Lillian Lara, this was rebutted by the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.361" offset="1642830">The questions here are whether antecedently to the giving of his confession, the police were constitutionally obliged to give Stewart a warning of a right to remain silent and a right to consult counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.282" offset="1726527">There is a second issue which was raised by Mr. Norris in his brief; a claim that there was an unlawful delay in the arraignment and because there was an unlawful delay in the arraignment, the confession being according to Mr. Norris, the product of that unlawful delay, the confession should also have been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.162" offset="1806043">I will address myself first to the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.271" offset="1830494">As suggested in the briefs and this is a good phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.730" offset="1844391">I like it so I keep saying it. This case is a grandchild of Escobedo and a child of Dorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.320" offset="1874693">What we are contesting here is the interpretation which the California Supreme Court placed on the Escobedo case, an interpretation of which the California Supreme Court in Dorado and by extension here claimed to be and here, I'm thinking perhaps of Justice Black's use of the word compelled under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.427" offset="1991095">That they said that we are compelled as a matter of federal constitutional law to hold on the basis of the Escobedo case that these warnings must be given, these rights must be waived otherwise a statement no matter how free and voluntary it may otherwise be, may not be received in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.483" offset="2071343">In other words, the California Supreme Court has held that there is a generalized Sixth Amendment right to counsel which emanates from circumstances occurring either at or after the arrest of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.227" offset="2134350">We believe that the true interpretation of Escobedo is the interpretation which was suggested by questioning in oral argument by Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Harlan that it is a totality of circumstances case continually throughout that decision in it's limited holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.048" offset="2221599">Escobedo speaks of under the circumstances here where as here under the facts as here and certainly in that case which was the de -- involved the denial of a request to consult, retain, counsel by a person whose attorney was on the outside trying to get in at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.601" offset="2331836">This was an affirmative act of denial by the State under the circumstances as found by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.589" offset="2371751">We do not therefore read Escobedo as our Supreme Court has done, as creating in any individual, a kind of in coed executory interest which vests at the time of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.544" offset="2443640">It's been suggested and in here, I'm thinking of an article which Mr. Justice Fortas wrote several years ago, that the Right to Counsel begins at the time of arrest because at that time the adversary system commences.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.471" offset="2503304">Now does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="601.889" offset="2513021">We believe, as does the Solicitor General, that a certain amount of questioning is a social necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.953" offset="2545204">That is not only because some prosecutors may say, “We must have confession but also because questioning serves both an inculpatory and exculpatory purpose and let me if I can find in my notes, bring out a few statistics which I think will make this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.034" offset="2633603">These facts are contained in “Crime in California”, a very compendious book which is issued by the California Bureau of Criminal Justice -- Criminal Statistics Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.605" offset="2675816">In 1964, there were approximately 100,000, a little over arrest for felony in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.952" offset="2709253">Of these, 27.5% were arrested by department were released without the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.769" offset="2732450">These are men who were either determined to be innocent by the police or determined there was insufficient evidence to even seek a complaint from the district attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.065" offset="3317697">I do not know how significant the factor because we cannot empirically go to that much more deeply.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.967" offset="3341312">But I think this makes my point, that questioning serves a dual purpose not merely to get confession because we've got to have confessions in all cases, but it does serve the police function of bringing the charge in trial of those against whom there is evidence sufficient to justify such establishment and not bringing the charge of those who are not guilty and should be released.</text>

            <text syncTime="1182.693" offset="4836143">And under the decisions as set out in our brief, there is a certain pattern that once you start with that presumption, I -- I do not go so far as to say that necessarily you do bring the members of the grand jury into the -- that you bring the members of the grand jury physically into the police station, but the only statements which can be admitted under the California rule are those which are either completely volunteered by the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.629" offset="8467895">At the outset, I may -- if I may, I would like to follow up on Mr. Justice Fortas' question because as an advocate of course, I was looking for some independent state ground upon which to base a claim that it's' written as granted improvidently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.590" offset="8555771">There was another ground as you know which I did find and argued but that is now behind us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.947" offset="8577191">I was satisfied Mr. Justice Fortas that there was no independent state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.480" offset="8599343">That the California Supreme Court did feel compelled to reach the results it reached in this case because of Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.858" offset="8644901">Whether or not the California Supreme Court would have reached the result anyway in the absence of Escobedo is of course another question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.649" offset="8683980">I think and I will argue this, I hope I would find time to argue this, that the California Supreme Court has taken the correct approach in interpreting and applying Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.065" offset="8737688">The California Supreme Court in effect said there are three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.220" offset="8754301">One is the “accusatory stage” reached at the time of the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.078" offset="8793694">Two, is the right to counsel which attaches at that point dependent upon a request?</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.494" offset="8835385">The answer, no of citing Carmony and Crawford (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.092" offset="8853776">Thirdly, was there a waiver of the right to counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.124" offset="8877913">And the California Supreme Court again correctly I believe, looked to such questions as warning as the age and experience of the accused to determine whether there was a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.643" offset="8939980">I believe, Mr. Justice Fortas that the California Supreme Court was relying squarely on Escobedo.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.549" offset="9075608">And it is my position here that on the facts, the Stewart case raises a very narrow question and that is whether the requested itself was an essential ingredient in the Escobedo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.584" offset="9159722">I believe of course that constitutional rights cannot possibly turn on such a tenuous ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.111" offset="9201831">I was interested that the deputy attorney general conceded that if Stewart had requested counsel, presumably the State would have had to furnish him counsel whether he knew a lawyer or not, whether he could afford a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.292" offset="9266615">Now once you reach that point, I think we can't penalized of course the accused who may not even know enough to ask for a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.271" offset="9306530">This case is indistinguishable as I say on all of its facts except for the absence of a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.246" offset="9338399">So to reverse the judgment of the California Supreme Court it seems to me, this Court must either overrule Escobedo or distinguish Escobedo on such a tenuous ground that for all practical purposes I believe it would be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.407" offset="9407049">The State makes an argument that in denying a request, the State took an affirmative act and placed itself between the accused and his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.316" offset="9466713">Well if it's an affirmative act that we're looking for and I don't really think when it's necessary, we have it when the police prolonged the detention for five days before taking Stewart before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.793" offset="9528571">That is an affirmative act keeping Stewart from his lawyer because once he gets into the formal judicial process he's entitled to a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.966" offset="9577263">I would like to review the facts of the detention just briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.634" offset="9599937">He was arrested along with his wife and three other persons who just happened to be at his house on the evening of January 31st.</text>

            <text syncTime="2576.811" offset="10412659">I would say clearly yes without regard to the request because here, I believe the police had much more evidence against him than a -- at the time -- by the time of the confession service and even at the time of the arrest than against Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.436" offset="10479114">They had a personal identification of him as the one who negotiated the checks.</text>

            <text syncTime="4512.261" offset="18154412">You know you don't have to testify and so forth, that would be one situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.160" offset="18182102">On the other hand, if you take a poor illiterate fellow who couldn't read nor write and who had no friends available or family available and they just went to him and said, “You know what your constitutional rights are.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.420" offset="18243124">You don't have to testify and if you do, we can use against you and so forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.662" offset="18264022">That in the exact quarters that they -- that they spoke to the District Attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="4599.558" offset="18503617">On the question of waiver, not however on the question as to whether we have effectively reached the accusatorial stage which is just another way of saving -- saying that we have reached the point where the person stands accused of a crime by the forces of the State and that's I believe -- the time I believe when he's entitled to all of his constitutional rights including his right to counsel at anytime that the State proceeds against him in an adversary way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.765" offset="18640499">I have argued as an alternative ground that the judgment should be affirmed because the confession was elicited during a period of illegal detention and I will just state that point because I really think these two arguments tend to run together in terms of their practical effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.439" offset="18751154">The fact is that Roy Stewart was held for 116 hours before being taken before a magistrate as were four others and we don't know the realms upon which they were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.973" offset="18805279">We do have a rather remarkable line in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.324" offset="18818759">The sergeant testified that the other four were released, including Stewart's wife following his confession on the fifth day because there was no evidence to connect them with any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.293" offset="18886572">Our view is that under the California law, they must be taken before a magistrate without unnecessary delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.172" offset="18918128">The State argues a 48-hour maximum in terms to permit a 116 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.734" offset="18948326">I think that is -- that you can't possibly reach that conclusion under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.653" offset="18972045">Without unnecessary delay means without unnecessary delay and they must explain why he was held all day Friday when the courts were opened then all day Saturday, all day Sunday, all day Monday when the courts were open and they finally got their confession out of them on Tuesday morning and took him before a magistrate that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.983" offset="19045397">Our position is that the State must establish reasonable ground rules to authorize police to arrest persons and to hold them for a reasonable period until they can get them before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.456" offset="19107255">A valid purpose of such a statute may not in our view be to hold him for the purpose of interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.085" offset="19145812">Now if the State -- if the police do not operate pursuant to these ground rules, then the police are operating beyond the law and that we submit is clearly a deprivation of liberty without any process of law much less due process of law and we think therefore that applying Wong Sun the exclusionary rule of McNabb that this confession obtained during a period of illegal detention must be excluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="4843.375" offset="19478925">There is also a question under Griffin against California since the prosecutor commented on his failure to testify on some of the counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.601" offset="19511839">And in conclusion I would like to say that we must make a choice it seems to me between the adversary accusatorial system or the inquisitorial system and I think those who argue against Escobedo are caught between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.960" offset="19569309">I think we must recognize that this practice of secret police interrogation why they conducted a little pretrial procedure here against Roy Stewart complete with tape recorders which they turned on at their convenience, complete with an accusing witness, complete with a statement that the handwriting expert testified that -- or had stated that he had signed the checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.379" offset="19682889">They tried him in the back room of the police station and held him as long as they needed to, to get finally get the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.878" offset="19720923">And when he did confess, he confessed to a simple act of purse snatching.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.986" offset="19741403">He was very careful to avoid in his confession saying that he had anything to do with any of the other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.873" offset="19776930">He confessed that he run up and he took a purse and he said, he was asked whether he kick her and he said, “I'm not sure, she fell I think and well apparently she hit her head and there was no evidence that this was an intentional beating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.631" offset="19831996">He didn't know the consequences of the felony murder doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="4956.373" offset="19930948">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.025" offset="19941501">I would like to begin by making one preliminary point which has no relevance whatever to the case, I think, but it was not injected by Mr. Norris, the crimes nor the arrest of Mr. Stewart occurred in the Watts area, so I don't think we find in this case the emotional aura that is associated with that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.633" offset="20031990">This was some six miles north of Watts. Secondly, I think we should bear in mind that when the officers arrived at Mr. Stewart's house, they found a house full of stolen goods which were not limited to the exhibits which were introduced in evidence at this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.448" offset="20111193">It's been conceded by Mr. Norris that Stewart was arrested on probable cause and it's quite clear from the record that Lillian Lara were arrested on probable cause at the very moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.274" offset="20158527">Now it's true that the record as to the other three men is totally indeterminate as to -- from the existence of probable cause although they were in a house which is full of stolen goods but this would seem to follow the record being indeterminate precisely because it was Stewart who was on trial and not these other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.671" offset="20236058">And so there was no occasion to go into the – no occasion, to go into the other circumstances involving them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.968" offset="20265315">Out of this 116 hours delay before the taking of Mr. Stewart, before the magistrate, we've already pointed out the total time of interrogation, consumed was less than three hours, according to the testimony of the investigating officers, all of the other persons involved were questioned about these exhibits as well as the other exhibits that were found in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.735" offset="20356326">The ultimate question in this and I think in any case involving the introduction and evidence of a confession or incriminating statement of the accused is whether it was coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.273" offset="20398540">I mentioned at the opening argument there was an issue at trial with coercion which was strictly limited to a claim that the officers have promised to release Lillian and return for his confession after he confessed and that she was released and that this was rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.648" offset="20468025">The other claims that have been made by Mr. Norris, I think, are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.322" offset="20506687">That fundamentally, that this man was -- this man made a confession which should not have been received in evidence against him because the right to counsel attached even upon arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.823" offset="20560708">We have already stated our views as to the Escobedo decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.450" offset="20575232">We understand of course that there is a conflict in opinion among the various jurisdictions as to the meaning and scope of Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.711" offset="20608251">We suggest, however, that our interpretation of it, that it's a totality of the circumstances case is the proper and the correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.248" offset="20646390">The next point I'd like to bring out is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.804" offset="20664675">That the -- this case differs from the other four that were before this Court, in that in each of the other cases, when the police a man they arrested him because of a certain specific crime and any statement that was taken was about a certain specific crime that they've arrested him for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.071" offset="20745655">The officers went here having prob -- went to his house have probable cause, they believe that he committed at least before jury of the Whales check.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.920" offset="20781077">They discovered all of these other property which led an envisioned the thought of his possible implication in the series of other brutal crimes, including murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.100" offset="20821828">Had they not questioned him, there would have been no way to bring home to him or to anyone else in the world these crimes and the police would have been required simply to do this to take the exhibits which were found, return them to the victims and to say, we think or we have a suspicion that your act was murdered by this gentleman, that you were beaten by this gentleman, and that would an end of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6156.216" offset="24730269">I'm sure that Mr. Frank and Mr. Flynn in 759 also were doing this as a work of charity and I'd like to express our appreciation to all of them and of course, our appreciation to those who represent the interests of the states.</text>
