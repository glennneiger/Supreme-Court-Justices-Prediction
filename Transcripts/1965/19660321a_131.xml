            <text syncTime="49.075" offset="299656">This action was begun to set aside for fraud the settlement of prior derivative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.934" offset="335078">The same relief here is sought that was demanded in those actions, that is the return to Alleghany Corporation of stock, as we say, illegally taken from its portfolio or damages measured by the value of that stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.820" offset="398608">The prior actions were pending in the District Court for the Southern District of New York and the New York County Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.130" offset="431940">They claimed among other things that the principal defendant here, Allen Kirby and three other officer, directors of Alleghany Corporation, acquired 48,000 shares of a Class A stock of investors diversified services from Alleghany's portfolio.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.555" offset="505605">The stock was alleged in both the state court and the federal court to have been acquired by means of false and misleading proxy material in violation of Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.739" offset="570284">It was successful in gaining shareholder approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.934" offset="591078">The prior actions also alleged that the same facts gave rise to a common law liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.605" offset="613752">All of these actions were settled with judicial approval of the state court in December 1959.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart N. Updike</label>
            <text syncTime="146.768" offset="690448">In the state court only, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.427" offset="705076">For convenience and speed in getting through fairly lengthy facts, I would like to divide my fact presentation into three-time groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.053" offset="747604">One, the period of 1949-1950, when the self-dealing transaction took place; two, the period from 1954 through 1957 when these litigations were proceeding and discovery and in the direction of settlement; and finally, 1959 when the case was settled with New York State Court approval following which this action was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.048" offset="859512">And while this action was pending, it was brought on behalf of Alleghany by Murchison Brothers of Dallas, Texas and a man named Fossland (ph) in Chicago seeking to set aside these settlements on the grounds that I have stated but while this action was pending and in the course of a proxy contest, a -- the slate of Murchison Brothers succeeded in ousting Mr. Kirby's management and as a consequence of that, certain of what we call, the concealed material which we think was crucial to the determination of the liability involved that is when it was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.250" offset="1032338">Now, the self-dealing transaction came about like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.523" offset="1053445">In 1949, Alleghany Corporation after a good deal of careful study and on the recommendation of Mr. Kirby, and Mr. Robert O. Young, who was the Chairman of the Board of Alleghany Corporation, they acquired 85% of the voting stock of IDS.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.511" offset="1121468">IDS is the investment advisor of the largest mutual fund complex in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.043" offset="1151561">And in 1949-1950 it was also a highly leveraged investment company on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.039" offset="1191476">IDS had in addition to its voting stock, Class A stock, the only difference being that the Class A stock had no vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.572" offset="1229615">And while control of the voting stock was being acquired, authorization was given by the Board to acquire some Class A stock as a long term investment for Alleghany.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.331" offset="1284681">In that manner, 48,000 shares were acquired at an average cost to Alleghany of $8.15 per share.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.441" offset="1325119">Upon acquiring control in April of 1949, Alleghany sent a man named Robert Purcell who was Vice-Chairman of its board and a Securities Analyst named Shipman to IDS and those men found at IDS that there was a regular year in, year out, month in, month out program of forecasting the income, forecasting the expense and finally forecasting the net earnings of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.915" offset="1475062">As a result of those trips to Minneapolis where IDS had its base, one of the forecast that was found was a five-year forecast dealing with the years 1949 through 1953 and whereas the stock had earned a $1.25 in 1948, that was the year before it, Alleghany bought in the prognosis by ideas for its earnings was $4.59 for 1949, $5.67 for 1950, almost $8 a share in 1951 and over $10 a share in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.134" offset="1647888">With this information at hand, and on the 6th of December, 1949, a board of seven directors met, there were 10 directors of Alleghany but only seven were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.295" offset="1712567">And of that seven, four, well, Mr. Young, the Chairman of the Board; Mr. Kirby, the president; Mr. Purcell, the Vice-Chairman; and Mr. Anzalone, the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.086" offset="1763767">All four of them of course were directors and they were needed for a forum and they formed a majority of the board at the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.650" offset="1813922">At the suggestion of Mr. Young, it was resolved that Alleghany offer to the officer, directors, the opportunity to acquire 48,000 shares of this stock at the average price to Alleghany in exchange for turning in Alleghany preferred stock at market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.420" offset="1937011">After that meeting -- oh, this was made subject to stockholder approval at the stockholders annual meeting on May 3rd, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.484" offset="1973269">But between the date when this stock opportunity was voted and the date of the shareholders meeting, additional projections were prepared, additional projections came to the attention of Mr. Purcell, Mr. Shipman and as we contend to Mr. Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.396" offset="2052995">In some respects, we know from the court below that some of them came to Mr. Kirby.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.200" offset="2080162">Those projections indicated that for 1950 itself, these shares being offered to these directors for $8.15 as a whole purchase price, these shares were expected to earn over $20 per share and that in the five-year period of which 1950 was the first year, in no year would be the earnings be less than $13 per share and the average earnings were almost $18 per share.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.713" offset="2234180">Now that, if the Court please, is the posture with respect to the so-called inside information as we charge, and of course, none of these information was ever disclosed in the proxy material.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.198" offset="2304188">That is the transaction that all of the judges of the Court of Appeals held was illegal because it violated fundamental principles against self-dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.119" offset="2355806">They all concluded that the proxy material was false and it was misleading especially in its omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.936" offset="2399065">In 1954, more than 20 derivative actions were brought against the insiders on Alleghany's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.716" offset="2430203">Some eight different cause of action were alleged in the New York cases, one of which was one based on this transaction, and that's the only transaction that we bring before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.314" offset="2480671">It was the insider's fraud as we claim in achieving a settlement of those actions that this case derives.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.526" offset="2509511">Ten of those actions were instituted in New York State and they were consolidated under the caption Zenn against Anzalone.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.817" offset="2546604">Ten parallel actions in the Southern District of New York likewise were consolidated under the same caption and Abraham Pomerantz who perhaps is the best-known man in the field of derivative stockholder litigation was named as general counsel for all of the plaintiffs in both the state court and the federal court in the consolidated action.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.661" offset="2645974">Mr. Kirby was a citizen of New Jersey and he was named as a defendant but he was not served in the state court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.907" offset="2675022">The plaintiffs here holds however, were able to bring him into the federal court action, as we call it, Zenn federal by saving him extra territorially under the Federal Securities Acts, he appeared in the federal case, was represented there by counsel and that case is still pending in the Southern District Court, not dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.535" offset="2777527">Both the complaints in the state court and the federal courts specifically referred to Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act in alleging that they had -- that the shareholder vote had been achieved by the use of force and misleading proxy statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.849" offset="2862791">The Pomerantz led group commenced discovery in Zenn federal and as part of that discovery, Pomerantz demanded any and all forecasts and projections of IDS earnings prepared by or for the use of Alleghany or IDS and although those -- such projections did exist, and at least three out of the four insider defendants knew it, none were produced among the thousands of papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.920" offset="2995075">Thousands of papers were produced for Mr. Pomerantz's firm and for the other plaintiffs' lawyers in these cases, but none of these were produced, and Mr. Pomerantz so testified in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.908" offset="3059022">His proceeding -- discovery proceedings were interrupted by an offer of settlement from the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.726" offset="3086294">And unaware of the existence of these projections, Pomerantz reached a settlement of this and of other causes of action for an aggregate sum of $700,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.818" offset="3146689">I will deal more fully with this in a few moments but at page 1359 of the record is a replica of a longhand letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.601" offset="3221817">This is in Volume 4 sir, page 1359.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.328" offset="3276675">It's a replica of the letter and I draw attention to its date, July 27, 1954, this is some months after the commencement of the derivative litigation that I've just referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.862" offset="3334771">It's a letter from Mr. Purcell to Mr. Robert Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.769" offset="3362461">And he transmits with this letter in completion of Mr. Young's talking with Mr. Pomerantz, the counsel for the plaintiffs in these shareholder cases, he transmits to Mr. Young one of the projections which had it been shown would have demonstrated that the stock would -- was believed in 1950, in January or February of 1950, was believed to be about to earn $20 a share and that is the subject -- thank you -- that is the subject of this letter and I shall deal with it more fully in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.844" offset="3550751">Although the discovery had been conducted in Zenn federal, the settlement was taken to the New York State Court for submission and for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.696" offset="3594115">Now, about this time, a competing group of Alleghany shareholders led by a man named Randolph Phillips and a lawyer named Graubard instituted an overlapping derivative action in the Southern District which was captioned Breswick against Briggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.330" offset="3664645">They obtained an order in the Breswick case which stayed the use of the Pomerantz settlement by the defendants in these Pomerantz -- in the Zenn cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.471" offset="3713233">They stayed the use of any settlement negotiated with Pomerantz with which excluded negotiations with the Breswick plaintiffs and their counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.510" offset="3761403">And Judge Dimock later was to refer to that order, that state order, as creating a veto in the Breswick plaintiffs over the Zenn settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.193" offset="3812185">Now, this Graubard-Phillips group appeared in the state court to oppose the settlement negotiated by Pomerantz and the state court referred the matter to a Referee to hear and report on its fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.140" offset="3859937">In this posture, the state court Referee hearings began after the fairness of the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.637" offset="3885955">The Pomerantz of course, claiming that it was fair; Graubard claiming that it was unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.422" offset="3909047">But both of them were proceeding in ignorance of what we now know to have been extensive forecast and projections of income that were available to the insiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.536" offset="3957530">The issue before the Referee was stated by him, thus, was there substance to the shareholder claim that the upward surge of IDS earnings was foreseen to or foreseeable by the insiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.170" offset="4020015">Was there substance to the claim that the proxy material was false and was misleading?</text>
            <text syncTime="986.170" offset="4048018">Now, Mr. Graubard pursued these issues relentlessly and unsuccessfully over 35 hearing days extending over some three months, he repeatedly reiterated Mr. Pomerantz's demand for forecasts, for projections, for earnings, for financial records in either of those categories but he never got to see the projections that are before this Court and in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.175" offset="4188035">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.226" offset="4192319">In Volume 3, at page 1104 appears the five-year forecast beginning in 1949 and running through 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.217" offset="4260237">I referred to earlier, this was sitting in the files over time and it shows in 1953, I've given the Court the other figures that by 1953 these shares were expected to earn over $12 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.911" offset="4339022">That by turning in the same volume to page 1121 -- we have, I'm sorry to say the reproduction is not very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.371" offset="4380818">But it still can be figured out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.078" offset="4391685">We have the five-year period beginning 1950 and running through 1954, and there as the Court will see for the year 1950 the projected income is $7,100,000 which is over $20 a share and almost $300,000 shares outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.196" offset="4476113">And for the next year, it's $18 then $13 and then $15 and then $18 again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.765" offset="4506415">In addition to these projections, the records showed that actuarial studies had been made with a view to determining whether IDS was going to be able to meet its obligations on time, studies of cash flow and again, each one of those actuarial studies was related to the forecast to which I've just drawn the Court's attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.601" offset="7905782">That is folded in line with our talk following your meeting with Pomerantz.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.179" offset="7968057">That income from operations, i.e., before taxes or capital transactions had been projected at $5,992,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.775" offset="8034513">But it turned out to be $8,600,000 which is over $25 a share.</text>

            <text syncTime="1999.467" offset="8101282">Now, this is in contemplation of a talk between Young and the plaintiff's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.252" offset="8124374">This may not be too helpful especially since the income for the proceeding here was a $1.5 million which is a little bit over $4 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.705" offset="8174216">Now, if the Court please, Mr. Waag had sent three enclosures in his letter to Mr. Purcell.</text>

            <text syncTime="2039.151" offset="8260002">Two of the three enclosures that came from Mr. Waag to Mr. Purcell were innocuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.058" offset="8283617">They contained information that was generally available and those two enclosures were produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.571" offset="8313605">They were given to the plaintiff's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.579" offset="8321651">They were introduced in evidence before the Referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.282" offset="8336488">But the piece of paper that contained the projection of $5,900,000 never found its way in that case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.076" offset="8399705">The state court proceeded to confirm the Referee's report subject to the state that the Breswick plaintiffs had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.533" offset="8433455">In September 22, 1959, Judge Dimock handed down a decision in which he declined to vacate the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.139" offset="8467937">He had been asked to do so in order to pave the way for the approval of the state court settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.493" offset="8497298">He declined to do so in stating that the adequacy of the settlement in his view had not been completely probed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.664" offset="8534079">Following that, the defendant Ireland who had been working for the New York Central informed Mr. Kirby that he was going to be called as the first witness on the new hearings that had been ordered by Judge Dimock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.983" offset="8587264">He also told Mr. Kirby that Mr. Young had figured himself in the state court proceedings, the settlement hearings and that this would undoubtedly be brought out on the new hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.835" offset="8634702">Mr. Kirby immediately turned to his lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.519" offset="8649435">They also represented Alleghany incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.297" offset="8660511">He turned to his lawyers and asked them for their opinion as to his maximum outside liability if everything went wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.279" offset="8692485">And they advised him that his potential personal liability arising out of this transaction totaled $62 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.897" offset="8734908">Now, spurred by that advice, Mr. Kirby authorized the commencement of new settlement negotiations which he carried on through Mr. Ireland who by this time had become an officer of Alleghany Corporation and Mr. Ireland negotiated with Mr. Phillips who was a representative of the plaintiff's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.621" offset="8809827">And as a consequence of their negotiations before the end of 1959, a separate settlement from Mr. Kirby had been worked out by his paying an additional $1,100,000 beyond the $125,000 which was his share of the prior $700,000 figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.946" offset="8903137">Now, in connection with the presentation of this, Mr. Kirby retained new counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.705" offset="8966144">His former counsel were representing the Estate of Robert R. Young and the Robert R. Young Estate was not settling so Mr. Kirby retained new counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.295" offset="9004596">And at the same time, it developed -- there was a need to have counsel for Alleghany and at that point, Mr. Ireland, a lawyer, became Alleghany's counsel in presenting this settlement to the United States District Court for the Southern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.937" offset="9063111">Now, he is the man who negotiated the settlement on behalf of Mr. Kirby and in that connection, the testimony below was -- there was testimony below that Mr. Ireland with the approval of Mr. Kirby offered $45,000 a year for 10 years and a position to Mr. Phillips to induce him to take the settlement offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.351" offset="9180766">The District Judge however found that Mr. Phillips rejected the bribe offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.698" offset="9218173">Mr. Ireland representing Alleghany, the Graubard plaintiffs having now become satisfied with the new offer, they will join hands as Judge Friendly said at his dissent below and went before the Court and Judge Dimock left it to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.953" offset="9299153">They went to the state court and the state court made its settlement -- its order approving the settlement final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.740" offset="9338337">Nothing was done then and nothing has been done since to remove Zenn federal from the row in the United States District Court for the Southern District and in that connection, there may be a technical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.287" offset="9432482">First, if the Court please, we think that Mr. Kirby would like to have the benefits of this settlement without accepting the responsibilities for the concealments that made it possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.372" offset="9492877">Now, I have been charged as having abandoned any claim against these defendants in the -- or at least against Mr. Kirby and against Young and Purcell in connection with the trial of this case in the District Court, because I did say I didn't know who did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.493" offset="9553377">I didn't know who was responsible for these concealments but I didn't abandon the fact that they were the concealments or that Mr. Purcell and Mr. Young testified with respect to areas where they obviously had to have knowledge such as indicated by this letter and where they -- never made the disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.095" offset="9635715">So this was argued to the District Court, it was argued in the post trial brief to the District Court and of course it was argued in the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.303" offset="12220583">He wasn't served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.535" offset="12225494">But he was served in the federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.705" offset="12234167">And in the federal action was where the demand was made on his attorney that called for the production of these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.022" offset="12263424">So the issue as to Mr. Kirby is a not a realistic one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.477" offset="12277321">He was required by legal process to come up with such documents as he could control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.156" offset="12315982">Now, if I may, I will turn to the intervention point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.372" offset="12340851">And this as I point out, the suit began in September of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.722" offset="12366242">There came a time, a year and a half later when Alleghany itself took over the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.154" offset="12387976">That state of affairs continued through the trial and a decision after the dismissal in the District Court was taken to appeal to the Court of Appeals from so much of the decision as was predicated on a dismissal of the complaint based on this concealment charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.237" offset="12464358">When we came to argue that in the Court of Appeals, Mr. Kirby's counsel applied for a day certain for argument, early in December of 1963 for the reason that he had acquired by purchase control of Alleghany Corporation but that control had not been formalized at any shareholders meeting and in order to have the posture as he thought it correct, he said to the Court, we'd like to have a day certain for argument because on 4th of December, at a special meeting of shareholders at Alleghany, control of Alleghany will pass directly into the hands of the plaintiff-appellee, Kirby.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.108" offset="12695803">Now, the case was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.576" offset="12709700">It was decided about five months later, 2 to 1 with Judge Friendly dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.392" offset="12732897">At the conclusion of Judge Friendly's dissent -- at the conclusion of Judge Friendly's dissent, the last sentence reads, “Since Kirby has regained control of Alleghany Corporation, I would instruct the judge to make provision for the continued prosecution of the action free from any control by the present directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.071" offset="12895692">In that posture of the case, with Mr. Kirby at -- by this time, in fact in control, I apply to the Court of Appeals for instructions to me and to my framers, officers of the Court in the circumstances they are presented.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.738" offset="12958281">While that application for guidance was being considered, Alleghany itself asked our views, we gave them, they authorized us to make an application for rehearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.530" offset="13021497">That rehearing en banc was granted 4 to 3 and we were authorized to proceed to rebrief the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.292" offset="13052531">That was 4 to 3 because as this Court will recall, it's a nine-judge court but Judge Lombard disqualified himself and Judge Clark had died earlier that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.682" offset="13094118">While the case was being briefed, the person appointed Judge Anderson to fill the vacancy period by the Deputy Judge Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.996" offset="13127346">The case -- the briefs were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.018" offset="13143437">The Court took it under advisement on the 12th of January of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.127" offset="13163917">The Court came down with a 4 to 4 split.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.021" offset="13187427">At that time, again, we were asked for our views this time to write a letter to Alleghany.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.849" offset="13206758">We gave our views urging that an application be made to this Court for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.819" offset="13234657">The Alleghany in addition to asking our views took the views of Mr. Hughes' firm will be far as to independent guidance and that firm did not take any position with respect to the merits but advised the directors that whether they voted for or against the authority to my firm, they would not be personally liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.463" offset="13333191">Accordingly, the directors voted with Mr. Kirby and his sons I believe absenting themselves and one director abstaining and they declined to authorize us to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.416" offset="13388988">That was not a publicized decision of the Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.299" offset="13404557">Some two months later, just shortly before our time to do anything about it would have run out, the interveners here, Mrs. Holt and Ms. McMahon learned of the development of the refusal of the Alleghany Board to go forward with an application for certiorari and they authorized us three or four days later to bring this application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.861" offset="13506853">The record shows that they own an aggregate of about $60,000 market value of Alleghany stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.387" offset="13532871">The District Court declined the application under the rule and the rule itself just set forth at page 3 of my brief says, “Intervention as a right upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action when the representation of the applicant's interest by existing parties is or maybe inadequate and the applicant is or maybe bound by a judgment in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.927" offset="13651048">Now, I don't think there's any dispute here that had -- that had the -- excuse me -- yes, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.200" offset="13696188">I don't think there's any dispute here that had the application of this Court not been made, these intervener's rights would have been bound by the result of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.407" offset="13741014">That is the resulting action from the Board of Directors not authorizing the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.239" offset="13772361">Next, intervention of right upon timely application, we think that the application clearly was timely because they took their action within three or four days following their learning of the non-action, if you will, by the Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.468" offset="13845295">We don't think that timeliness is due to start at the point where Mr. Kirby came back into literal stockholder control or as long as this litigation was being pressed forward, the -- these intervener's rights were being represented in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.335" offset="13916662">And when the election was made not to go forward, their representation ceased so far as the litigation is concerned and if representation here means representation by the Board of Directors, then we submit that every member of this Board of Directors owed his presence on that board to the suffrage of the majority stockholder of Alleghany Corporation and the principal defendant responsible if we're right with respect to this action.</text>

            <text syncTime="4229.113" offset="17019800">The -- I do want to stress that this -- that the Board was an independent board and it's conceded that it was an independent board.</text>

            <text syncTime="4242.627" offset="17073925">Now, the law is very clear that management of a corporation is in the Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.947" offset="17103182">That's been decided time and again not only by this Court but by every court that's ever had occasion to consider the matter and it's also clear that that control of the affairs of the corporation also goes to the control of litigation involving the corporation and we say the leading case on that is Swanson against Traer which is cited in our brief which discusses all the cases including the cases in this Court and also was the rule in New York with the cases on pages 8 and 9 of our brief discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.510" offset="17237452">Now, I want to stress independence here and to stress the fact that on this record, the petitioners concede the integrity of these directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.349" offset="17296802">At page 79, they say that as far as adequacy of the board's decision is concerned, we don't question the integrity of the men involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.581" offset="17329716">Well now, if you don't question the integrity of the men involved, you mean, you're certainly saying that they're honest, that they're not banal, that they're not pliant, that they're not subservient and that they're acting according to their own honest consciences.</text>

            <text syncTime="4338.787" offset="17458552">Now, there was more to this question of whether these people were independent in the Court of Appeals and that's highlighted by the footnote that appears in Judge Kaufman's opinion at page 2385 where he says that the applicant's counsel expressly refused to characterize the board as dominated by the Kirby group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.304" offset="17544547">Now, that came about in this way, that as Mr. Updike was making his argument before the Court of Appeals, he started to talk about the bruiting presence of Mr. Kirby whereupon Judge Kaufman said, “Well, Mr. Updike, are you charging that Mr. Kirby dominates this Board of Directors?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.926" offset="17623124">He was invited, he was invited to say that and he expressly refused to say -- to characterize them as being dominated.</text>

            <text syncTime="4641.981" offset="18671261">First, there's the fact that the courts below unanimously found that the proof did not show that Allan P. Kirby was guilty of any fraud or failure to volunteer evidence in the Zenn proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.513" offset="18733432">No question has been presented here challenging that this finding is erroneous under Rule 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.029" offset="18763525">Yet the petitioner's main brief just like the pleadings and like this Rule 16 statement of issue -- issues before the District Court repeatedly states that Kirby was guilty of deceit and that he knowingly joined in a fraud on the part of others on the Referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.372" offset="18836877">The unchallenged findings in the record are to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.521" offset="18853491">There was a complete failure of proof on this basic issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.674" offset="18878046">Secondly, there are the findings of the courts below that the documents allegedly concealed were cumulative or irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.604" offset="18921827">These findings took into consideration not only the IDS projections that was received in evidence in this case, but also those that were excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.495" offset="18973341">No question has been presented to this Court here challenging these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.562" offset="18997582">Yet petitioners repeatedly say that this evidence was in their words crucial and would have destroyed the Zenn defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.769" offset="19042408">Now, we have analyzed each one of these 12 documents that were allegedly concealed and compared them with those that were before the Referee in point -- we've done that in points one and four of our brief, main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.688" offset="19122134">And we submit that that shows that they add nothing to what was already before the Zenn Referee.</text>

            <text syncTime="4923.769" offset="19798497">He pursued it all through the courts twice having it adjudicated on appeal within the state courts and he never sought review here of the question of whether it was a 14 (a) cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.077" offset="19847711">Our position is therefore that he is bound under the doctrine of this Court's recent decision in Durfee against Goo -- Duke by the adjudication of the state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4983.533" offset="20037465">Well, the third fact of significance to us and I think perhaps follows just what Justice White was pursuing is that except for the so-called corrupt bargain claim below in this action, dismissal of which after trial was never appealed, the sole issue alleged presented under Rule 16 and tried before the District Court was whether or not Kirby had defrauded the Zenn Referee, not Young, not Purcell but solely Kirby.</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.962" offset="20171212">There was no claim below of fraud in the part of Young and Purcell and no claim against Kirby based on any fraud by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.483" offset="20201305">No such issue was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.576" offset="20209664">Petitioner's counsel expressly disclaimed any such charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5031.016" offset="20227427">The complaint was limited to Kirby's conduct and after 20,000 pages of depositions, and a series of Rule 16 pretrial conferences, the statement of issues was limited to Kirby's conduct it read, did Kirby procured by fraud certain judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.134" offset="20299943">Young and Purcell were never involved either in the corrupt bargain claim which was dismissed in every appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.210" offset="20328260">Yet the petitioners for the first time on appeal inject the charge that Young and Purcell committed a fraud upon the Zenn Referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.337" offset="20368697">Judge Friendly accepted that charge as the cornerstone of his dissent and the only basis found in the record was a statement of petitioner's counsel made as he was examining Purcell which Judge Friendly quoted as follows, Mr. Updike, “Well, it seems to me sir that Mr. Kirby entrust the responsibility to some extent of his being a director of Alleghany that he entrust some of that responsibility to Mr. Young that Mr. Kirby cannot avoid accepting the consequences of whatever Mr. Young may have done.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.122" offset="20495862">Judge Friendly stopped there but what Judge Friendly did not quote was the balance of the same sentence in which Mr. Updike continued right on to say, “And I do not say that it was Mr. Young and I do not say for a moment that it was Mr. Purcell and I do not know who is responsible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.017" offset="20579453">The completed statement without truncation which the only reference Judge Friendly could find is a disclaimer, and Kirby's counsel, we submit, was entitled to rely upon it and on the pretrial statement of issues and the pleadings in conducting his defense and in cross-examining the very witness on the stand, Mr. Purcell.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.152" offset="20672031">And we submit that a theory based on Young and Purcell's conduct is not now open to the petitioners, that they're barred by their pleadings, their statement of issues, their statements at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.860" offset="20726784">Now, although petitioners' brief, reply brief points to counsel statements in the District Court made after trial on the issue presented to the effect that Kirby could not escape responsibility by delegating to others the duty to search out and volunteer records.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.325" offset="20808704">Not one of these statements ever claims fraud on the part of Young and Purcell.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.638" offset="20829915">The first time that was claimed was on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.828" offset="20842663">The next fact that I think is very significant is that the attack here is not upon some joint settlement made in Zenn by Young, Kirby and Purcell.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.531" offset="20889475">It is on Kirby's separate settlement approving what the complaint specifies in this action, 22 times as Kirby's “separate settlement”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.872" offset="20942869">There was never any issue, proof or finding of any joint action between Young, Kirby and Purcell in the conduct of the Zenn settlement hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.778" offset="20982471">Kirby was neither subpoenaed nor served in the Zenn action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.331" offset="21004727">The record shows that he negotiated a separate settlement, separately approved by a separate judgment over the strenuous objections of the Murchisons and the disapproval of the Young Estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.107" offset="21059793">He was not called, although he was served in Zenn federal, that case was never pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.486" offset="21081318">It has been dormant since the action was begun and he was not called to testify there nor was he called, subpoenaed to produce any records there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.090" offset="21119770">Yet petitioners in the dissent predicate their position here entirely on the existence of some kind of a conspiracy or joint action between Kirby, Young and Purcell.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.884" offset="21166895">Next, there is the fact that the legality of the underlying 1949-1950 exchange, stock exchange transaction and of the proxy material used to obtain its approval was not an issue below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.291" offset="21228544">It was expressly excluded as an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.297" offset="21240560">It has never been tried except to the extent, the Zenn Referee and the Zenn court considered it when they were passing on the fairness of the Zenn settlement and they concluded that the transaction on the proxy material would be upheld after a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.811" offset="21306598">The record shows in this case that the District Court in one of a series Rule 16 pretrial conferences said, and I quote, “What we are not going to try are the merits of the 1950 transaction itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.823" offset="21366680">The trial will not go into the issue as to whether the 1950 transaction was a bad transaction or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.697" offset="21394160">It will not go into the quest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.138" offset="21399907">It will go into the question of whether certain facts were concealed from the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.671" offset="21418088">Is that understood by everybody?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.855" offset="21426761">To which Mr. Updike replied, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.921" offset="21439091">And at a later point, Judge Dawson said, “I am not going into the question of whether the Zenn-Anzelone case was a good case or not, yet the petitioners here assume the illegality of the basic 1949-1950 exchange as the whole predicate of this appeal and they do so on the strength of an assumption made by the Court of Appeals in this case without benefit of any issue, any trial or any findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.358" offset="21560822">And the fact that the Court of Appeals was making an assumption is evidenced by the statement of the majority opinion at page 2344 of the record in which it was said after the assumption and I quote, “But the bona fides of the 1950 stock exchange were not the issue for determination by the District Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.136" offset="21687881">The issue was whether there was a sufficient basis for a federal court to nullify a settlement in a case involving fraud which had been judicially approved in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.113" offset="21731871">Next, there is the fact that the said action was adjudicated by the New York Supreme Court and the appellate division as I pointed out earlier as one for common law fraud in which Section 14 (a) allegations were incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.912" offset="21799058">No attempt has been made by the petitioner's representatives there to seek review, we submit that under Durfee v. Duke, they're bound and yet the appeal here, and the questions presented here are based entirely on the assumption that Zenn was to quote their brief, “A Section 14 (a) action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.123" offset="21879829">Lastly, I'd like to point out that the legality of the 1949-1950 exchange transaction was neither alleged nor involved in the Breswick suit in the dis -- Federal District Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.809" offset="21938657">The one in which the injunction was issued by Judge Dimock.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.476" offset="21957256">Breswick and Zenn had other claims in common which involved American citizens but not the claim based on the 1949-1950 transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.440" offset="22005112">The Breswick court, Judge Dimock, never approved the Zenn settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.926" offset="22031026">The -- its injunction arose out of other claims before it not the legality of the said 1949-1950 exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.591" offset="22065716">Yet the petitioners erroneously in our opinion asserted here that the alleged fraud related to a claim before the Federal District Court in Breswick.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.209" offset="22104168">Now, petitioner's counsel here has (Inaudible) referred it to the claim that Ireland offered a bribe to Phillips and said that the District Court dismissed it finding that Phillips had rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.588" offset="22177729">I would like to point out in view of that statement that the District Court had that claim before it analyzed it thoroughly and concluded on the District Court's own words that the evidence was all to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.275" offset="22236453">It found not just any rejection but it found that the so-called bribe was to be part of a settlement that would be presented to the Court whereby Mr. Phillips' services might be retained for the -- as a representative of the opposition in the corporation if the settlement went through now and that did not go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.205" offset="22324224">And the Court -- no appeal was taken from that so I think it's improper at this point to refer to any bribe which has been thoroughly passed over and found unsupported.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.005" offset="22367378">Reference has also been made to some statement made to Mr. Kirby about Mr. Young having committed perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.035" offset="22395486">I -- we have treated that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.249" offset="22404368">I shall not go into detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.717" offset="22410219">I would like to point out just this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.420" offset="22425057">The statement was a hear -- triple hearsay statement made on the basis of an opinion of a non-lawyer with respect to another case, Young against Ebbett involving a matter that was not an issue here, a transaction between the Murchisons and Alleghany for the part of certain stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.358" offset="22504782">It had nothing to do with this underlying transaction, the stock exchange in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.936" offset="22531114">Now, one or two other background facts I think are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.836" offset="22550758">The present case relates to only one out of eight claims in the Zenn suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.769" offset="22570402">It started 1954 and that charge that in 1950, Alleghany's directors had obtained stockholder approval of the so-called 1949-1950 exchange by concealing favorable current earnings, current earnings, and by concealing earning prospects and the claim was that the defendants could foresee that from this evidence that the market price of IDS stock would enjoy the spectacular increase that began some years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.938" offset="22723166">At the protracted negotiations and pretrial depositions, a settlement was proposed in 1955 in the New York State Court, not the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.693" offset="22770186">That case lay dormant and has ever since and it was referred to a Referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.271" offset="22792443">The hearings before that Referee developed into a hotly contested proceeding in which 22 law firms appeared, some for, some opposed the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.303" offset="22832567">4600 of pages of testimony were taken from 18 witnesses, and 480 exhibits were introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.777" offset="22866526">The objections by their own later testimony examined voluminous documentary material including 28 Alleghany file drawers containing documents relating to IDS and the personal files of Young relating to IDS.</text>
            <text syncTime="5707.891" offset="22934967">IDS had its main offices and its principal office in Minneapolis and it was then under the control of the Murchisons, not Young, Kirby or Alleghany and the mass of proof before that Referee included both optimistic and pessimistic forecasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.791" offset="23018559">There was evidence that the transaction when viewed as of the time it was made and without the benefit of the hindsight was not unfair to the stockholders and that the proxy material did not rep -- misrepresent the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.957" offset="23083238">Now time does not permit analyzing all that evidence now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.532" offset="23101524">We have reviewed it in pages 10 to 22 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.344" offset="23120750">Just one or two facts I think are significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.395" offset="23132975">After the transaction was consummated back in 1950, IDS' earnings did rise sharply but after these, these earnings became public, the market price of IDS stock remained close to the same level it had -- exist -- it had enjoyed prior to that for quite a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.724" offset="23226284">And in July 1950 for instance, IDS rose to $15 a share and IDS' president who had all of the allegedly concealed forecasts and projections required Alleghany to fulfill an earlier contract to buy 3034 shares at $20 a share, the market then being $15.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.875" offset="23330879">He certainly was not impressed by the forecasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.858" offset="23346761">By August of 1951, one year after the sharp earning's increase became public, IDS stock had risen to only $32 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.233" offset="23388348">And then but only then it began its meteoric ascent to $200 a share in 1954 and that was what led to a flood of stockholders' actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.653" offset="23437981">Now, the Referee submitted a 125-page report and in viewing this transaction, weighed both the optimistic and the pessimistic factors and he noted that the directors had it by the stockholders to quote the phrase from the statement or proxy statement that “The outlook for future earnings was unusually promising”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.499" offset="23541321">That they were dealing with hopes said the Referee as against reality and that if more specific rosy predictions were made but did not materialize, they would expose themselves to huge claims by disappointed stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.537" offset="23605478">Now, why is the proof claimed to have been concealed by Kirby?</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.648" offset="23621987">On the eve of trial, the petitioner listed 86 documents, and at trial -- as trial revealed that most of them were already in the Zenn record, before the Referee, there were whittled down to 12 and the record shows that the plaintiffs below, in answer to interrogatories stated that they could not say whether any of these documents were seen or made available to the Zenn Referee, the Zenn parties and the Zenn court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5908.104" offset="23735777">We think that's a striking admission in view of the claim that they were deliberately concealed by Mr. Kirby.</text>
            <text syncTime="5915.230" offset="23764302">Petitioners divided them into four categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.339" offset="23772766">The first they called the Waag correspondents and that I think has been dwelled upon at length by Mr. Updike here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.448" offset="23801187">That is dated more than four years after the transaction under attack in Zenn.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.381" offset="23828877">A proof of the record shows that Kirby was not a party to that correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.688" offset="23846118">He never knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5937.081" offset="23851656">He never had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.241" offset="23860328">Some of it was before the Referee but not the copies that were part of what was later turned -- produced in evidence in this proceeding but duplicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5951.948" offset="23911215">In other words, there were several copies of this around and two copies are part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.298" offset="23932531">Not the same strikes as the one they introduced here were put in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.353" offset="23956773">There's no basis for any charge that Kirby concealed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5967.152" offset="23972028">As for the second category, the so-called IDS projections, those documents came from the Minneapolis files of IDS.</text>
            <text syncTime="5976.069" offset="24007659">Kirby could not have furnished them to the Zenn Referee because he didn't have them and he was neither an officer nor a director of IDS and at the time of the Zenn hearings, it was under the control of the Murchisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5989.919" offset="24063039">For two weeks, in 1949, six years before the Zenn hearings, Kirby's office had possession of one of those documents which was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.649" offset="24109955">Kirby did not recall it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.658" offset="24118000">But it was not a forecast of IDS earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.668" offset="24130017">It was an evaluation of IDS certificates and income available for improvement of reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.715" offset="24158229">Also, this document, this allegedly concealed document, was identified by author, by date and quoted from in another report before the Zenn Referee, the shipment report, exhibit 295 and referred to in annual IDS, annual reports that was before the referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6034.430" offset="24241089">Certainly, that doesn't show any concealment by Kirby.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.330" offset="24256658">Then the third category they've listed are the Stybel reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="6042.199" offset="24272123">The claim there is that Kirby concealed one report, the second Stybel report dated March 15, 1949, over a year before the stock exchange that is the subject of attack on Zenn.</text>
            <text syncTime="6056.986" offset="24331368">Stybel was a Cleveland investment firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="6060.289" offset="24344534">That document was in the public files of the SEC which were examined by Mr. Pomerantz and his group in the Zenn stockholders action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6070.722" offset="24386226">Kirby testified, “I don't remember ever seeing it before.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6075.115" offset="24403884">He had no reason to conceal it because it updated -- it was updated and repeatedly referred to by title and date and incorporated by reference in another report by ref -- before the Referee, the shipment report of April 7, 1949 which took at least as favorable view of Alleghany's prospects as to that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="6096.617" offset="24489880">Lastly, petitioners' category is the monthly reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.528" offset="24509524">Petitioner's statement that Kirby received these reports every month which they make in their petitioners' brief is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6108.885" offset="24538885">The record shows Kirby had only one such report in his possession and that was not relied upon by the petitioners here because it postdated the transaction under attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.932" offset="24587055">That is the record as to Kirby, if Your Honors please, and we submit that it shows a complete failure of proof and the courts below recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6131.938" offset="24631150">The proof is equally clear that even if the petitioners' proposed special disclosure rule were adopted, Kirby did not conceal or withhold any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.718" offset="24682245">Now, turning to the new claim made for the first time on appeal that Young and Kirby concealed evidence, if the rule against raising new issues on appeal is to have any meaning, it certainly applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6159.303" offset="24740551">Petitioners raised not just a new legal theory but a new issue of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.359" offset="24764792">If their new claim had been asserted on the District Court, there would have been different interrogatories, different depositions, different pretrial statement, and different proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6176.106" offset="24807842">We would have certainly gone after Young and Purcell staff to just -- see just what they did have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6181.656" offset="24829994">We would have gone after Pomerantz and Graubard staff to find out -- get all their notes as to just what they did see from these voluminous files.</text>
            <text syncTime="6190.449" offset="24865207">Kirby would have joined Young and Purcell as third party defendants in the action if they committed fraud without his knowing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6197.772" offset="24894464">We would have offered additional evidence to confirm that the IDS records were passed over in Zenn because counsel there felt that they already have sufficient proof and didn't want to invite defense proof that those forecasts without benefit of hindsight amount to nothing more than economic astrology.</text>
            <text syncTime="6219.470" offset="24981295">If Kirby who had not committed any fraud were told six years ago when this actions were commenced that Zenn was going to be resurrected because of alleged fraud by Young and Purcell, he would have marshaled all the evidence to show that the original exchange and proxy statement complied with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.817" offset="25066663">Instead, he relied on his Zenn judgment approving his separate settlement as he had a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6247.715" offset="25094248">Six years later, much of that proof has undoubtedly evaporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.298" offset="25112534">It would be manifest -- be unfair, we submit, to ask him now to try to resurrect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6258.456" offset="25137194">Therefore, even if we were to assume arguendo and we say it's not the fact that Young and Purcell defrauded the Referee, it would be unjust now to set aside the Zenn settlement as to Kirby who was admittedly innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.955" offset="25199156">Now, if there were proof of conspiracy, agency or some joint action in the conduct of those Zenn hearings, our basis might exist for holding Kirby responsible for the conduct of Young and Purcell but there is no such proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6290.815" offset="25266657">The claim below and the undisputed proof was that Kirby made a separate settlement opposed by Young's Estate and the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="6301.684" offset="25310124">Now, since Young's conduct was not an issue in this case, it should be unnecessary to review such literal record evidence as there is on the subject but when we do review it, we find that Judge Friendly was in error when he inferred from the 1954 Waag correspondents that Young probably concealed 1950 IDS forecast from the Zenn Referee and let me explain if I may why.</text>
            <text syncTime="6332.024" offset="25431437">There was other evidence in the Zenn record not known to the Zenn -- to Judge Friendly but known to the Zenn Referee which shows that Judge Friendly was wrong and that Young and Purcell both made a whole disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6347.563" offset="25493608">Judge Friendly inferred that Young probably withheld one 12-page enclosure in that Waag correspondence because two back pages showed that back four years earlier, in 1950, IDS had prepared a forecast of its 1950 earnings and that this clue would have acquainted the Zenn Referee with the existence of the forecast and led people to go trotting on out at Minneapolis to get them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6375.359" offset="25604786">And Judge Friendly's inference is destroyed by the record of Young's deposition before the -- in the Zenn proceedings which was Zenn Exhibit 4, which Judge Friendly didn't see.</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.751" offset="25650343">And it shows, we have attached it as appendix, Appendix C to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.527" offset="25669465">It shows that in the same March 29, 1955 deposition where the petitioners claimed that Young “sat mute”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6399.882" offset="25702902">He testified in detail to the fact that IDS in Minneapolis routinely prepared earnings, forecasts and projections including a five-year projection prepared annually some of which he received and I quote his words, “from time to time”.</text>

            <text syncTime="7113.426" offset="28557040">I would like to point out one very important piece of evidence which I think has been wholly left untouched by petitioners and that is the fact that on February 11, 1950, the objectant's counsel had before him and introduced into evidence in the Zenn proceedings a report by Mr. Purcell, one of the defendants to Young and Kirby, the other two defendants, Zenn, forecasting $19.61 of income per IDS share, from IDS' mortgage department alone for 1950 plus increased revenue from all other departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="7158.763" offset="28738435">Now, we submit that that forecast which is at 1186 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7166.910" offset="28771035">Certainly, a plaintiff, the Zenn Referee with the essential facts as to what was being forecast at that time, the value of forecast is a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="7180.637" offset="28825893">It's also been -- that the witnesses testified that such forecasts of course have very limited value in view of the many other pessimistic factors that were in existence in 1949 and 1950 but were taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="7195.400" offset="28884929">Now, it's also been suggested that there was a concealment of IDS forecasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7202.830" offset="28914709">I pointed out that Young testified that he had the -- he from time to time received IDS forecasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7211.182" offset="28948146">He testified again in December 1955 before the Zenn Referee and by that time, it was clear to everybody that Purcell had taken back with him from Alleghany to IDS in Minneapolis these forecasts that Alleghany had received when Purcell went there to become president in 1953 and that he would bring them back with him when he came to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="7235.915" offset="29046993">And in January of 1956, he did come to testify.He testified for a full day and he brought with him as he testified and I quote, “An enormous briefcase in one hand, an enormous manila folder into my other arm containing IDS financial projections and records and IDS projections.</text>
            <text syncTime="7257.597" offset="29133720">Now, Young had no motive therefore to conceal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7261.307" offset="29148557">He knew that Purcell was coming along with the IDS projections and the record shows, this is the Zenn record, that Purcell appeared with the ID -- that when he appeared with these records, they were examined for only a few minutes, that's what the record shows by the Zenn objectant's.</text>
            <text syncTime="7278.713" offset="29218252">And that at end of a full days testimony of a 130 transcript pages, Purcell announced to the 15 lawyers present and this is Purcell's testimony, “This company, referring to IDS, produces a large number of reports, many of which I brought here today that nobody has asked me about.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7299.994" offset="29303306">Now, he was inviting everybody to interrogate him about the IDS records but the objectant's counsel Graubard shows not to because he had the Purcell report between the very principles involved that was far more valuable to him than anything else he could possibly had.</text>
            <text syncTime="7318.529" offset="29377494">So he decided to let -- well enough alone and we submit the proof of -- there's no proof in this record of fraud on the part of Young and Purcell.</text>
            <text syncTime="7329.750" offset="29422320">Now, there's some testimony that -- or statement here that Graubard said later that he would have by (Inaudible) offered a certain exhibit in the evidence or a certain forecast.</text>
            <text syncTime="7340.488" offset="29465370">If that record is read, it shows that he could not recall whether he had seen this exhibit and he could not recall when other IDS forecast was shown to him, whether he had seen them because he said he had a team of people going through thousands of records and many of which were examined by others and not by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="7360.415" offset="29544991">Pomerantz testified to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="7362.816" offset="29554604">He had a team and he test -- he examined part of the records, Mr. Clinger, an accountant examined part of them and Mr. Haudek examined the -- another.</text>
