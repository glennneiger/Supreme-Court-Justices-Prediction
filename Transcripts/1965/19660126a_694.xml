            <text syncTime="29.042" offset="219512">Mr. Harris. Oh, we'll wait just a moment until counsel is ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.599" offset="249814">Now, Mr. Harris you may proceed with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="45.442" offset="285132">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.409" offset="313031">This matter known as In re Perry comes for this Court to review the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit which judgment was entered on the 25th of January, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.091" offset="427760">Writ of certiorari was filed here and granted on October 25, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.203" offset="472168">If it please the Court, there's really no -- there's no question involved here except one very simple claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.136" offset="511875">The issues can be resolved to one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.795" offset="534549">Can a wage earner be permitted to file a Chapter XIII proceeding wherein he asks for an extension of time to pay his bills in full, when he has received a prior discharge in straight bankruptcy within six years of filing the extension plan under the Chapter XIII?</text>
            <text syncTime="144.767" offset="682402">Now it's important to the issue to distinguish between a composition and an extension and I mean a wage earner plan by way of composition or wage earner plan by way of extension because provision is made for both proceedings under the Chapter XIII Act, but whether this is a -- for the fact that this is an extension plan, is of primary importance, the decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.962" offset="867244">Composition of course is where the debtor would say, “I can't pay my debts in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.528" offset="889501">I propose to pay so much on a dollar -- 50 cents, 75 cents on a dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.733" offset="910294">The creditors will go along with me and consent to it, then within the time limits of a Chapter XIII Act of three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.186" offset="940074">I could pay off 50 to 75 cents on a dollar,” that's a composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.483" offset="965256">He has been paying his debts in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.623" offset="973824">An extension plan is where the debtor says to the court, “I want to pay my bills in full, a 100%, I want to pay my secured creditors a 100%, my unsecured creditors a 100%, all I want is time.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.532" offset="1033488">I want a three-year period or less in some cases to pay my bills in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.749" offset="1058356">I want the protection of the court, stay suits against me and garnishments, so that I hold my job and pay my debts,” that's what an extension plan is.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.912" offset="1099003">Now that's what Perry filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.732" offset="1146337">He filed a wage earner plan in which he said, “I owe about $1,400 and I want to pay them -- my debts in full both secured and unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.430" offset="1217076">I make so much money a month and I have to pay my rent, food, utilities, and transportation, and etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.090" offset="1251767">I have $60 left and this $60 a month was taken out of my wages or will pay my debts in less than the three-year period, in fact about 28 months.”</text>
            <text syncTime="302.104" offset="1311744">And he asked the court, the referee in bankruptcy to confirm the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.725" offset="1338284">But a motion was filed by one of the secured creditors that had a mortgage on certain furniture, it was listed in the plan, it would have been paid in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.675" offset="1398053">The Commerce Loan objected to confirmation, filed a motion to dismiss and deny confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.946" offset="1431176">The referee sustained the motion, denied confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.235" offset="1448312">The matter was taken to the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.702" offset="1462209">The referee's opinion was affirmed subsequently it was taken to U.S. Circuit Court for the Sixth District and was affirmed, and we're here on this matter today.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.022" offset="1519470">The prior bankruptcy was a straight bankruptcy filed about four and a half years prior to the wage earner petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.004" offset="1555414">It was -- that was recited in his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.090" offset="1575685">In his Chapter XIII petition, he indicated an answer to one of the questions in the petition, had he filed any bankruptcy before and he said, “Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.034" offset="1611525">I filed a bankruptcy petition in 1959 and received the discharge in 1959” and the Chapter XIII petition was filed about four -- four and a half years later in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.985" offset="1671293">That was a matter of record in the petition itself that he had received a discharge in straight bankruptcy within the six-year period.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="435.400" offset="1844955">Earlier straight bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.432" offset="1853106">These are not two successive wage earner plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.454" offset="1881213">Now, there's plenty of argument, if it please the Court, on a philosophical and sociological ground, but we want to meet the statutory objections head-on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.833" offset="1958745">And all the while, we'll dwell on the sociological aspects of it, I still feel that the congressional intent as indicated by the Chapter XIII statutes was that this relief which we seek, wage earner plan by way of extension, is afforded to any wage earner regardless of the fact that he has had prior relief under the Bankruptcy Act within six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.867" offset="2090820">And I don't want to burden the Court, but these statutes are technical and important and I don't want to even paraphrase them and at time to time I will be verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.713" offset="2142229">A section of the Code, I would like to indicate first to the Court the contents of a petition in Chapter XIII, which is Section 623 of the Chapter XIII Act, and same Section 1023 of Title 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.933" offset="2227075">A petition filed under this chapter shall state that the debtor is insolvent or unable to pay his bills as they may mature and he desires to effect a composition or an extension out of his future earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.849" offset="2306800">And I call the attention of the Court that here a composition or an extension is contemplated or both by the Chapter XIII Act, but in this particular case, the debtor Perry proposed to pay his bills in full and only asked for an extension of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.039" offset="2383496">The treatment is the crux of the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.621" offset="2401886">Now, it may run through the minds of the members of this Court, “Well, why is it that this debtor having had the advantage of the Bankruptcy Act and proceed to discharge some four years prior -- why is he now again in this financial dilemma?”</text>
            <text syncTime="598.034" offset="2495509">And I say that that probably does run to the minds -- run through your minds, but I would add to this, to this question, why is it that this debtor and thousands and thousands of others throughout the country had found that bankruptcy is just not the solution to their problems and there's no question to what -- that a straight bankruptcy does not solve the financial problems of the lower one-third of a segment of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.585" offset="2657677">We're dealing with wage earners who live from one pay day to the next.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.267" offset="2688397">They're the ones who file bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.993" offset="2703339">They're the ones that over extend themselves in installment buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.799" offset="2726536">They cannot resist the sales pressures for the various credit houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.782" offset="2758510">They're the ones that have to have credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.497" offset="2773347">If they get sick or they laid off for matter of few weeks, they need credit to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.073" offset="2799679">And of course, thousands and thousands of them find themselves in financial space where bankruptcy has been their hopeful solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.542" offset="2853491">But why is it that they return to the lawyer and say, “Well, here I am again -- two years, three years, I'm back in financial trouble.”</text>
            <text syncTime="699.063" offset="2899675">We lawyers that practicing in the bankruptcy field, find this occurs more and more.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.410" offset="2924962">And we've sought a solution and we feel that Chapter XIII is the solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.722" offset="2946278">But there are several reasons why they get back in financial trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.943" offset="2963101">In the first place, they're not of the most intelligent type of person.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.344" offset="2992776">They're the low economic group, and they are constantly bombarded by furniture stores, appliance stores, used car dealers, that as soon as they see that bankruptcy petition in the paper, they say, “Well, here is a man that can't go bankrupt for six more years.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.983" offset="3099355">He's a pretty good risk.”</text>
            <text syncTime="752.927" offset="3115029">So this bankrupt is solicited by various firms selling various merchandise and he's a human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.059" offset="3175633">He wants to provide things for his family that other people do and he doesn't realize that again, he's over extending himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.821" offset="3214608">He doesn't look out for the rainy day, but there are two or three other considerations why he gets into trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.595" offset="3257762">He can't go to a legitimate financial institutions for help after he's been bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.811" offset="3282631">An emergency arises and it doesn't take very much to be in an emergency in this man's household, a few weeks off work, and the gas electric may be ready to shut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.039" offset="3343548">So, where is he to go?</text>
            <text syncTime="813.918" offset="3359013">He invariably will go back to a finance company that he has previously discharged in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.170" offset="3388061">He hasn't paid them.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.023" offset="3391509">He hasn't paid the deficiency balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.569" offset="3397674">It may be a deficiency on a car, a furniture, or a just note, well, but he hasn't paid them.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.073" offset="3423692">But they haven't forgotten about it or they're still holding that note, the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.387" offset="3448874">So one day, he wanders in their office.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.045" offset="3463502">He needs money.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.579" offset="3465697">He needs a $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.695" offset="3474160">Maybe it's just to buy Christmas toys for his children but he still needs a $100, maybe it's to turn on the gas electric say.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.956" offset="3503208">So they say, “Yes, we'll loan you the $100, but you have to renew our old balance.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="885.950" offset="3647195">It's pertinent because I'm explaining to the Court that we're not just considering Perry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.720" offset="3670288">We're considering of thousands of other cases just like Perry that's in financial trouble that needs the help of a Chapter XIII Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.890" offset="3726921">Now, what relief can we afford this debtor, if Chapter XIII is not available to him?</text>
            <text syncTime="918.413" offset="3777076">He can't go bankrupt for six years and he's still within the six-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.792" offset="3790555">That's elementary, he can't file a bankruptcy petition except once every six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.358" offset="3820753">We feel that the Congress intended that the Chapter XIII Act, the extension plan is provided there under, should be made available to any debtor regardless of the fact that he's received a discharge within six years or not and I would like to call the Court's attention to some of the pertinent statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.873" offset="3930885">Now before Chapter XIII was ever enacted, we had Section 14 (c) of Chapter III of the Bankruptcy Act or otherwise known as Section 32 (c) of Tile 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.395" offset="4012910">This is been on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.527" offset="4017507">It's been amended a good many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.551" offset="4033599">The statute worked long before Chapter XIII was ever enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.850" offset="4062751">It provides, if I may read the pertinent part of it, “The Court shall grant the discharge unless satisfied that the bankrupt has committed or failed to do one or more of eight different things.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.068" offset="4155643">Six of these implied guilt such as falsifying the schedules, concealing assets, making false financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.691" offset="4198170">Six of them in applied guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.875" offset="4206843">The last one is failure to pay the cost, but number five, the one we're concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.141" offset="4231920">14 (c), paragraph 5, subsection 5, unless the Court shall grant the discharge unless satisfied that the bankrupt has any proceeding, under this title, commenced within six years prior to the date of a filing of the petition in bankruptcy, been granted a discharge or had a composition or a wage earner's plan by way of composition confirmed under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.087" offset="4387715">Now the phrase “or had a composition or a wage earner's plan by way of composition” was added in 1938 when Chapter XIII was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.563" offset="4449573">But it is significant, that when 14 (c) was amended because of the Chapter XIII Act, Congress eliminated the wage earner plan by way extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.566" offset="4529612">It seems to me to imply that they did not intend for the so-called guilt statute as we call 14 (c) to apply to a man that wanted the protection of Court to pay his bills in full.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.689" offset="4694079">If you will permit me to refer to the other sections in the Chapter XIII Act, which I'm about to, you'll bear with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.634" offset="4745906">Section 656 (a) of Chapter XIII is the confirmation section where -- when a plan shall be confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.139" offset="4807973">Now, the section provides that the referee has to find several things before he can confirm a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.391" offset="4864920">He must find first that the provisions of this Act have been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.107" offset="4887803">He must find the best interest of the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.514" offset="4905462">And he must find that the plan is fair, equitable, and reasonable, and feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.912" offset="4931062">And also he must find that the debtor has not been guilty of any of the Acts or failed to perform any of the duties which would be a bar to the discharge of a bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.762" offset="5006399">So, in view of this section, we have to determine did Congress intend then to refer Section 656 fact, to Section 14 (c) of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.026" offset="5095528">That would be a good question, except for the provisions of Section 602 of Chapter XIII.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.050" offset="5219558">Mr. Smith, I think, cites Section 602.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.003" offset="5263339">Section 602 provides that provisions of Chapters I to VII inclusive of this Title shall insofar as they are not inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions of this chapter, apply in proceedings under this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.920" offset="5355081">The provisions of Chapters I to VII inclusive so apply, if they're not inconsistent or in conflict with Chapter XIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.139" offset="5407953">Included in Chapters I to VII, is obviously Chapter III and Section 14 (c) which is the guilt statute, the discharge sentence statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.371" offset="5468871">Now it submitted that Congress certainly intended that a wage earner plan was a special proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.296" offset="5540551">It was special remedy to cure a special ill and by placing -- by passing Section 602 they indicated that if the Bankruptcy Act, especially the discharge section within six years, is in conflict with the intent of the basic purpose of Chapter XIII than is to give way to Chapter XIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.968" offset="5703241">And that is the theory upon which the Court's have reasoned in holding that the six-year bar does not apply to wage earner plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.683" offset="5774085">And we feel that it's born out by the fact that in amending Section 14 (c), after the wage earner plan was placed on statute books, they purposely left out any mention of the wage earner plan by way of extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.254" offset="5888397">They referred to wage earner plan by way of composition, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.030" offset="5903444">That's when where he settles his debts and doesn't pay them in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.678" offset="5926118">But to encourage a man, a debtor -- a wage earner to pay his obligations in full, it was -- to me most assuredly, the congressional intent that nothing in Section 14, unless it's some fraud of course, but the other six grounds in Section 14 with no doubt, if he was guilty of any fraudulent acts, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.160" offset="6055999">But the fifth ground, having received the discharge within the six years, would not preclude him from participating in the benefits of extension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.126" offset="6123917">Now surely Congress had in mind that its better to lend assistance -- lend the assistance of the courts in staying suits, garnishments, preventing this man from losing his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.839" offset="6214719">Keep him as an active and productive member of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.150" offset="6243976">It's better to do that than just to flatly say, “Well, if you've been bankrupt before, you can't come into the court again even for a wage earner plan.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.870" offset="6310849">I submit, Your Honor, that it was the intention of Congress in view of all these statutes and of the sociological and philosophical benefits that derived here, definitely the intent was that this wage -- the wage earner is entitled to the benefits regardless of having --</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.926" offset="7071117">Back in August the 1963, a decision was granted on this motion -- a motion by Commerce Loan Company to dismiss or sustained by the referee in an opinion written, as I recall, in December of the same year, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.193" offset="7148126">Sometime later, almost a year later, Judge Swinford of the United States Court, Eastern District of Kentucky affirmed the referee's finding of dismissing the petition and also wrote an opinion in connection with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1875.740" offset="7606314">First of all gentlemen, this case is here on propositions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.098" offset="7639751">The facts are pretty well admitted, facts are admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.218" offset="7660231">I don't know that the 10-year dues should be taken sociologically, politically, or commercially on this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.179" offset="7724074">It's true and simple, simply a construction and an interpretation of the statute passed by Congress and as I see it, admits of no other construction or interpretation, but all the statutory provisions of Chapter XIII are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.317" offset="7832639">This is on page 3 of the brief for the appellee, if you care to follow along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.461" offset="7857194">Section 602, the provisions of Chapters 1 to 7, dealing with Chapter XIII inclusive of this Title, shall insofar as they are not inconsistent or in conflict with, the provisions of this Chapter apply in proceedings under this Chapter, U.S.C. A. Section 1002, Section 636 as to my understanding my opponent did not contend -- did not read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.637" offset="7965968">Following long under the Chapter XIII provision says this, “we are not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter,” that is Chapter XIII that is “all the rights and privileges and duties of the debtor shall be the same.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.364" offset="8036812">Are we to interpret from that, the question of discharge, discharge ability?</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.476" offset="8065233">Why most certainly, as if a voluntary petition for adjudication of bankruptcy have been filed under the decree of adjudication had been entered at the time the petition on this Chapter was filed, 11 U.S.C. Section 1036.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.228" offset="8124270">Section 656 (a), the Court shall confirm the plan if satisfied that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.949" offset="8143182">That what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.095" offset="8151751">That the debtor has not been guilty of any acts or failed to perform any of the duties, because it would be a bar to discharge the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.356" offset="8188844">By the provisions of Chapter III, Section 14 (c) of the Act, a discharge is denied if the bankrupt has committed any of the offenses or failed to perform any of the duties specified in the seven numbered clauses including Clause (5) which is as follows - Section 14 -- quoting Section 14 (c), the court shall grant the discharge unless satisfied that the bankrupt has,” subsection (5), “in a proceeding under this title commenced within six years prior to the date of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy -- been granted a discharge, or had a composition or a wage earner's plan by way of composition confirmed under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.273" offset="8368462">Now a composition under the Act of extension, are exactly one and the same for discharge purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.641" offset="8413915">There's no distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.405" offset="8424991">So if a person cannot see of the composition within a year, I mean, within six years where a previous bankruptcy -- when a person has filed a petition for bankruptcy and been discharged, then the same applies to an extension.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.895" offset="12166980">There's the decision from Macon, Georgia in the case of Arthur Hamilton written by the referee down there, I don't know whether the Court would want to hear that, it's somewhat lengthy, but it goes into dissertation of the law and the facts and it holds also the same as the Schlageter case, in fact precisely as Schlageter case and then there are five cases on appeal in the Fifth Circuit from District Court of the Middle District of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.759" offset="12294457">Two of the cases were dismissed by Referee Stewart, Mr. Smith, the other three were dismissed by Referee Algim Moby Jr.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.383" offset="12340955">The referees acted on their motion and dismissing these cases because of prior bankruptcy within six years and their action in so doing was approved by the District Court in all of those instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.692" offset="12394141">So, I have my doubts as to the number -- I believe that the number exceeds Your Honor in favor of the Schlageter case from those against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.462" offset="12445236">We do submit that the reasoning seems to be in favor of Schlageter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.770" offset="12486405">I'm sure that you're familiar with the wording of the Sixth Circuit case, it's very brief into the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.435" offset="12513155">One further thing that the Court -- we believe with the Sixth Circuit that this is purely and simply a question of legislation, it's a matter for the Congress and not for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.839" offset="12598732">There are many reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.899" offset="12606986">The courts are not equipped and set up to handle this kind of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.780" offset="12634467">They rather taken to do and since they have held elsewhere and they're making a mess of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.644" offset="12669994">Congress can set up appropriate bureaus, provide the appropriate salaries and the proper rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.763" offset="12718373">The matters under consideration right now by Congress and it had -- it was the last session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.773" offset="12742510">There are several bills before the Congress on this very proposition Chapter XIII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.827" offset="12770722">It may be that some legislation in this field is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.151" offset="12799979">We are inclined to believe that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.813" offset="12810637">We do think that the society is not wholly dependent upon this section for the reason that most state have receivership rules where you can go into state courts and ask for a relief on wage earner -- on wage earner's plans so they're not holding without relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.577" offset="12933726">Now, if Your Honor please -- if Your Honor please, there's an abuse on both sides because there are many bankrupt -- repeaters of bankruptcy who've been going into straight bankruptcy six months with the year or later coming right back having the same number of debts or probably more so, seeking further relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.305" offset="13048560">How long can that go on?</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.604" offset="13057755">Our court dockets are burdened or were burdened, overburdened with this classification of cases until this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.644" offset="13093909">Now it's down to where it probably should be under the Chapter XIII, the courts will have nothing to do to handle the cases, the legal cases that come before under Chapter XIII without having these extra legal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.162" offset="13155976">We respectfully urge the Court to read the cases Schlageter, also the case in the Sixth Circuit here, this particular case, the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.284" offset="13204459">The Nicholson case which I just read and dissenting opinion put in the Goldberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.543" offset="13233507">We would like to have you consider those citations and render your decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.463" offset="13277184">So, I believe that's all I can say unless there's any further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.174" offset="13592116">Now, Justice Stewart raised the question of the discharge that provided wherein the wage earner is unable to comply with to -- through the plan within three years because of circumstances beyond his control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.224" offset="13668289">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.529" offset="13673514">In the Schlageter case, I think based its opinion upon the fact that he could get a discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.829" offset="13706637">But my answer to that would be that if that situation happened and the creditor had not received a 100%, then he could make a motion to dismiss at that time or he could oppose the application for discharge if the man had gotten the discharge in bankruptcy within six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.741" offset="13782288">So the -- what Schlageter is doing, they're anticipating if the creditor had not received the 100%, he could then come in to the Court and say, “Well, I'm going to oppose the discharge because I haven't gotten my 100% like he said.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.659" offset="13846026">And he's got another discharge within six years and this would tantamount to a second discharge.</text>
