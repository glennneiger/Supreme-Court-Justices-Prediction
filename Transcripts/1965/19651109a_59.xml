            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="10.887" offset="146892">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.920" offset="167058">These cases, as all the world knows, arise out of a brutal incident during the summer of last year in the town of Philadelphia in the County of Neshoba in the State of Mississippi which culminated in the murder of three young civil rights workers; Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.465" offset="261204">These federal prosecutions are brought under Sections 241 and 242 of the Criminal Code in which some 18 persons -- three of them public officials, are accused of having joined together to deprive the three young victims of their civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.942" offset="343124">The actual facts cannot be detailed because no trial has taken place and the evidence has not been deduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.974" offset="371231">All of that's before the Court today is a bad charge consisting of two indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.624" offset="401847">The only question here is whether those indictments, assuming the facts alleged can be proved, state offenses against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.629" offset="449912">The overall charge is that the 18 defendants conceived and executed a criminal plan directed against the three victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.196" offset="496201">It is alleged that the three of the defendants, namely the sheriff of Neshoba County, his deputy, and a local policeman used their official powers to release the victims who were in state custody, turned them over to a lynch mob, which one of the officers had shielded by his presence with the view that they'd be summarily punished without benefit of trial and has alleged in defiance of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.814" offset="658578">The indictment in number 59 is only one charge, charges a conspiracy that was in charged to be in violation of Section 241, the whole of that indictment was dismissed as to all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.342" offset="728691">The first count of indictment in number 60 is the same conspiracy as charged as a violation of the general conspiracy statute, Section 371 of the Criminal Code, as a conspiracy to commit the offense defined in Section 242.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.785" offset="810506">That charge was sustained by the District Court as to all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.674" offset="834017">The three other counts of indictment -- the indictment in number 60 charged all the defendants with substantive violations of Section 242 by executing the criminal plan with respect to each of the three victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.548" offset="905592">And the District Court sustained those counts as to the three state officials, the three state law enforcement officers but dismissed on all three counts as to all other defendants because --</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="255.395" offset="1124916">Yes sir, it's our position because when -- as we see it, when state officers are involved, and then the conspiracy moves in charging the state officers and the individuals together, but it would not apply of course unless the state officers were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.414" offset="1193044">And in this case, the state officers are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.299" offset="1204537">I think I can clear it up a little later on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.738" offset="1230346">The Government, on both indictments, is the allegation of a conspiracy to willfully subject the victims to the deprivation of “their right, privileges, and immunities secured and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, not be summarily punished without due process of law by persons under color of the State of Mississippi”.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.344" offset="1356779">That's in the indictment -- that particular section is quoted from page 12 and 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.980" offset="1379244">And before going any further, I want to explain the relationship between this case and more particularly number 59 in the Guest case to be argued next.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.121" offset="1419891">This case is really the preamble to the Guest case.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.139" offset="1435878">There is no Guest case unless we prevail in this case on the main point which is, that Section 241 protects Fourteenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.344" offset="1480704">The two cases are thus very closely related, yet I would like to stress the differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.315" offset="1508603">The basic factual difference of course is that here, the state itself through its law enforcement officers and their confederates, charged with invading the civil rights of citizens, while in the Guest case, the interference is directly attributable solely to private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.839" offset="1578715">Here, there is no question that violation to the Fourteenth Amendment alleged, there's no question about it as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.283" offset="1604524">And indeed, the District Judge so found by sustaining the charge of conspiring to violate 242 which he held as to all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.391" offset="1644962">The only question in this case I repeat is whether 241 encompasses Fourteenth Amendment rights at all, and that is not a Constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.473" offset="1689266">At least since the Screws case, there can be no doubt whatever about the power of Congress to make it a federal crime for state officers to deprive citizens of their constitutional rights even if the conduct also violates state law, the sole question is one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.907" offset="1770977">Did Congress mean to reach violations of the Fourteenth Amendment in Section 241?</text>
            <text syncTime="424.536" offset="1801488">On the face of the statute, it is difficult to see how any such question ever arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.651" offset="1825938">Indeed, Section 241 punishes interference with exercise or enjoyment of “any right or privilege secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="441.731" offset="1870346">And certainly, the Fourteenth Amendment is a part of that Constitution, and certainly, the Fourteenth Amendment confers “rights or privileges”.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.880" offset="1910888">Why would Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights not be embraced by the provision?</text>
            <text syncTime="457.958" offset="1935235">One could imagine that doubt at the statute had been written before the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments became part of the Constitution, but that's not the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.333" offset="1976717">On the contrary, Section 241 was enacted in May of 1870 less than two years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment and only two months after the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.970" offset="2027290">As a matter of fact, Section 241 is a part of the first civil rights law passed after the adoption of the amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.784" offset="2058533">The natural assumption is that the new statute was peculiarly concerned with protecting these new constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.059" offset="2103568">Is there anything in the conditions of the time that suggested Congress was focusing on rights derived from the relationship of the citizen to the national Government rather than the relationship between the citizen and the state Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="513.197" offset="2156126">The time, I repeat, was 1870.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.494" offset="2169396">This was a reconstruction measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.260" offset="2180368">The problem then was of assuring equal rights and protection to the new freedmen who were the victims of racial antagonism against that background, it seems obvious, that when Congress spoke of constitutional rights had meant to include those derived from the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the right to freedom from racial discrimination, exercise of the right to vote guaranteed in the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.578" offset="2297710">As a matter of fact in the case of Strauder against West Virginia and it seems -- though these two cases, Strauder and Ex parte Virginia constantly come forward again but I think it's well the time to read it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.778" offset="2358523">The Fourteenth Amendment -- I mean Strauder says, the Fourteenth Amendment makes no attempt to enumerate the rights it designed to protect, it speaks in general terms and those are as comprehensive as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.592" offset="2413693">Its language is prohibitory, but every prohibition implies the existence of rights and immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.328" offset="2440652">Prominent among which is the immunity from inequality of legal protection either for life, liberty, or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.955" offset="2471163">Any state action that denies this immunity to a colored man is in conflict with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.024" offset="2503450">And in Ex parte Virginia, Mr. Justice Strong continued, “One great purpose of these amendments was to raise the colored race”, he is speaking of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment, “was to raise the colored race from that condition of inferiority and servitude in which most of them had previously stood, into perfect equality of civil rights with all other persons within the jurisdiction of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.707" offset="2606164">They who intended to be and they really are, limitations to the power of the States and enlargement of the power of Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="635.170" offset="2644093">I repeat, enlargement of the power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.227" offset="2660289">“They have got to some extent declaratory of rights, and though in form prohibitions, they imply immunities such as maybe protected by congressional legislation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="651.478" offset="2709295">Now that was the real problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.402" offset="2717027">It was not the problem of interference with the homesteading laws or the federal privilege, to inform on violations of tax laws, the indictment alleges here more than ordinary murder for personal reasons by a group of individuals, some of whom happened to be state officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.099" offset="2791737">One, it is alleged that the state law enforcement officers were acting under code of their office.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.345" offset="2816711">And two, it is further alleged that they use their official powers to release state prisoners, turn them over to a lynch mob which was shielded by the presence of another state officer, so that they could be summarily punished without benefit of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.308" offset="2892570">This, to my mind puts this case warily within the rule announced in the Screws case, and indeed within the rule announced in the Williams case at least insofar as Mr. Justice Douglas' opinion was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.962" offset="2951189">In the Screws case, there was no problem with the indictment, no court found any problem with indictment in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.406" offset="2976998">And in the Williams case, if you read the indictment, the indictment was closely similar to the one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.558" offset="3005628">Finally, is there something in the debates underlying the enactment of Section 241 that contradicts the entirely clear text of this statute, which I think most certainly clearly applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.353" offset="3064769">Despite the language and the historical context with point unmistakably to a congressional intent to protect the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights, as rights and privileges, is there some evidence buried in the legislative history that shows a different focus?</text>
            <text syncTime="756.364" offset="3128822">There is nothing of the kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.174" offset="3140106">What became Section 241 was an amendment to the Enforcement Act of 1870 proposed by Senator Pool of North Carolina, he proposed the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.469" offset="3193292">And he made his purpose very clear and there's nothing in the congressional record to the contrary, on this particular amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.848" offset="3226728">The only relevant speech is his own, when he first explained the object of his amendment, we have reproduced the entire speech of Senator Pool in an Appendix to our brief on the merits and it bails out what I have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.776" offset="3294438">The Senator begins by making it clear that this is a reconstruction measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.131" offset="3319933">It is entering a plan of new phase and reconstruction that is, he says, “To enforce by appropriate legislation, those great principles upon which the reconstruction policy of Congress was based.”</text>
            <text syncTime="819.179" offset="3380120">He then tells us more particularly, the conditions he is concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.083" offset="3399659">And he says “The equality, which by the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments has been attempted to be secured for the colored men, has not only subjected them to the operation of the prejudices which had theretofore existed, but it has raised against them still stronger prejudices and stronger feelings in order to fight down the equality by which it is claimed they are to control the legislation of that section of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.668" offset="3522017">They were turned loose among those people, weak, ignorant, and poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.163" offset="3539989">Those among the white citizens there who have sought to maintain the rights which you have thrown upon that class of people, have to endure every species of proscription, of opposition, and of vituperation in order to carry out the policy of Congress, in order to lift up and to uphold the rights which you have conferred upon that class.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.247" offset="3632358">It is for that reason not only necessary for the freedmen, but it is necessary for the white people of that section that there should be stringent and effective legislation on the part of Congress in regard to these measures of reconstruction”.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.925" offset="3711039">Though most of his speech is directed to the Fifteenth Amendment, Senator Pool plainly puts Fourteenth Amendment rights and particularly those derived from the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses on the same footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.924" offset="3779062">This is first, there is first, the long passage quote in our brief at page 40 and 41, which he emphasized the word 'deny' in those clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.598" offset="3821798">And he says, “The word deny is used not only in this Fifteenth Amendment but I perceive in the Fourteenth Amendment, it is also read”.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.069" offset="3863698">And again later, when he is speaking of the need to teach or to reach unofficial conspiracies, the Senate takes explicitly refers to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.930" offset="3915107">And he says, “But sir, individuals may prevent the exercise of the right of suffrage, individuals may prevent the enjoyment of other rights which are conferred upon the citizen by the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as trespass upon the right conferred by the Fifteenth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="974.260" offset="4000371">This last statement from Senator Pool's speech, emphasizing his concern with unofficial action, particularly conspiracies like the plan which he explicitly mentions, suggests the only argument against reading Section 41 to reach Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.319" offset="4080619">It has been said that because this statute, unlike 242, is not confined to acts done under color of law to officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.942" offset="4119176">It cannot have been meant to protect Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights, which can only be invaded by state officers or at least by persons acting color -- under color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.425" offset="4173093">And Mr. Justice Douglas pointed out in his opinion for the four justices in the Williams case, the conclusion does not inexorably follow from the premises, even if the Congress of 1870 had believed that it could not reached private individuals who interfered with the exercise of Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights, but which to protect the right one provision which protected all constitutional rights, it might well have written the same words we find in Section 241.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.707" offset="4306213">They are -- or rather they collect the Constitution itself, operate to confine the class of those who had compassed -- to commit the crime where the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.544" offset="4349576">That is indeed exactly what Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.181" offset="4364100">But the true explanation is that neither Senator Pool nor the Congress of 1870 saw any problem with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.096" offset="4399731">They thought rightly or wrongly, and we believe they were right as we will argue in the Guest case, that they could Constitutionally reach private conspiracies hostile to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.251" offset="4452394">You cannot reach Senator Pool's speech without reaching that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.958" offset="4471202">And if any proof or further proof were needed, you only have to look at the Klan Act of 1871 which this Court invalidated in United States against Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.654" offset="4513938">Now as I have said, we think the Congress of 1870 was right in its premise, but it does not automatically follow that the question in this case depends upon a case where there are no state officers involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.172" offset="4572035">If only persons acting under color of law can be reached, enforced -- in enforcing the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, then Section 241 must be read accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.847" offset="4622712">It would be nonsense I say, to say that the Congress of 1870 did not mean to reach any interference with Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment rights, because they thought they were reaching something that the inference would not allow them to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.761" offset="4686451">I say that on the particular point involved here, that first of all I've -- we have to make our position clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.571" offset="4725635">And that we are not here asserting that Congress intended to cover every crime committed under state law, and indeed in all of the briefs on the other side is alleged that this is peculiarly state crime, or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.796" offset="4794598">But I respectfully recall the Court's attention to the 1884 decision in the Waddell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.494" offset="4821347">And speaking of the same provision said, “The right here guarantied is not the mere right of protection against personal violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.828" offset="4862725">This is the result of an ordinary quarrel or malice, would be cognizable under the laws of the state and by its courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.327" offset="4896684">But it is something different from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.122" offset="4907865">It is the right to remain on the land in order to perform the requirements of the act of Congress, and, according to its rules, perfect his incipient title”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.914" offset="4951019">And under the Waddell case, I think the same provision would be here if the defendants in this case where merely out to commit an ordinary crime “as a result of an ordinary quarrel or malice” it would be strictly state, but that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.919" offset="5023013">I believe as I have said earlier, that the two cases which control this case, are the Screws case and that United States against Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.430" offset="5073063">And I think it's very interesting that everybody relies on United States against Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.488" offset="5101275">And I would like for a moment to explain our position as to the case in the first place, the decision was four to four with Mr. Justice Black concurring on a different point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.378" offset="5152893">But as to the points involved in this case, it was definitely a four to four decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.073" offset="5175672">And the language in the -- what is labeled in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas concurred in by Mr. Justice Reed, Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Clark, they traced the whole history of these sections, both of the sections and brought the sections up to date, both 19 and 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.412" offset="5268982">And I have no need to go back further in this because in both of the opinions in the Williams case, Senator Pool was referred to, the only addition we have made in our position in this case is to prick more fully the whole argument or rather the whole speech made by Senator Pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.018" offset="5351424">And in the Williams case, after the language, the constitutional history -- the congressional history rather was reviewed and the Screws case was reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.887" offset="5398967">That opinion made it quite clear that Fourteenth Amendment rights were to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.549" offset="5425612">And in this particular case, you add to fact that as to the Fourteenth Amendment rights in the three latter counts in the number 60 case, the court actually held the state officers to be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.306" offset="5492590">And then with the same vein, it comes back and says, “But it does not apply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.908" offset="5515055">It seems to me that you can't say the Fourteenth Amendment applies in one place and it does not apply in the other particular position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.333" offset="5556746">The emphasis in the -- the second emphasis was on Senator Pool's speeches which we have quoted and in the William's case, it was pointed out that as Mr. Justice Rutledge stated in the Screws case, there is no difference between Section 19 and Section 20 so far as the basic rights guarded are concerned, the coverage of the two sections is not coterminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.424" offset="5685060">The difference is not merely on the fact that's 19 covers conspiracies and 20 covers substantive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.298" offset="5720586">Section 20 extends only to those who act under color of law, while 19 reaches two or more persons who conspire to injure any citizen in the enjoyment of any rights or privilege secured to him by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.655" offset="5782026">The reach of 20 over deprivations of rights protected from invasion by private persons, is therefore in this one respect less than that of 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.323" offset="5824658">But this is no comfort to the respondents in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.503" offset="5841377">It certainly cannot be doubted that state officers or those under -- acting under color of state law who conspire to wring confessions from an accused by force and violence, are included in the phrase “two or more persons” within the meaning of Section 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.312" offset="5916609">And that from the Williams case, it seems to me applies in this particular case and if there are no further questions, I would save some time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.707" offset="6006157">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.215" offset="6032280">Half of the appellees directing our remarks furnished to the matter of jurisdiction in case number 59 as stated in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.402" offset="6077001">We believe certainly that this Honorable Court has jurisdiction to review on direct appeal case number 59.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.734" offset="6114304">The District Court in regard to case 59 in dismissing the indictment, holding that it did not state the cause of action against the United States, as the charge was made on the 241 restricted in his opinion that 241 reached interferences with the rights and privileges of the citizen in relation to the Federal Government, rights and privileges arising from the substantive powers of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.668" offset="6262053">In case number 60, it already stated, the indictment stands as against the officers -- the three officers in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.919" offset="6307088">The indictment also stands in count one against the all of the defendants as the charge was in violation of 371, Title 18 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.887" offset="6362885">The statutes, if it pleases the Court, were before the District Court as we understand it, was 241, 371, and 242.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.299" offset="6424534">No indictment in either case made in reference to Section 2, Title 18 of the United States Code having to do with the aiding or abetting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.666" offset="6482004">Our proposition then on behalf of the appellees is that Section 241 of the Criminal Code does not reach interferences with the exercise of natural rights of the citizen or the inhabitant, and such interferences are not encompassed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.924" offset="6571029">Certainly, equality and equal protection under the law is a right and privilege of every American citizen and all inhabitants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.052" offset="6619617">And it stands without debate that it is the duty of every Republican Government to protect that equality and right under the law of every citizen and every inhabitant of this -- our great country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.355" offset="6684818">But as it has to do with harm or injury by one citizen as against another citizen in regard to his natural rights, we respectfully submit that punishment for that type of alone is reserved to the respective states under the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.885" offset="6766947">The Fourteenth Amendment guarantee is a guarantee against encroachment of the individual rights in regard to encroachment by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.929" offset="6815117">242 certainly reflects the power of the Congress to pass laws to enforce any encroachment of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee, and they did that in passing Section 242, the color of law statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.005" offset="6895365">Therefore, generally our contention is that 241 reaches interferences with the exercise of those rights and privileges arising from the substantive powers of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.371" offset="6956805">Those rights and privileges arising because of the relationship of the victim and the Federal Government and not the general guarantee of the Due Process Clause and equal protection of the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed by 242 as action of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.898" offset="7043009">We feel that the cases of Logan, Yarbrough, William and Classic, Saylor, Waddell, Quarles and others cited in the brief, support that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.695" offset="7090134">Let's make reference a moment to the statute 242 and 241 in regard to the differences in those two statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.847" offset="12634781">And the Court held in that case that the principle of 241 did not extend in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.092" offset="12663724">If we could relate it, the hypothetical more closely to interstate commerce powers, if it was an interference of the substantive rights of the Federal Government in regard to the function of the interstate commerce, and the facts were so alleged in an indictment, I have no doubt of what 241 -- the principle of 241 would reach any conduct that was charged in the indictment in such a manner as it would have to do with the interference of rights or privileges arising from the substantive powers of the Federal Government whether it would be interstate commerce or any other based on Federal Government power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.532" offset="12817533">It is the best I can answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.917" offset="12859016">On page 13 of the Government's brief, they contend -- the Government contends that the courts prior to the Williams case taken for granted that 241 covered Fourteenth Amendment rights and the reason is brought forward there that it was assumed that the courts prior to Williams presumed that it reached the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee and that the courts would determine that the conduct charged did not come within the guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.770" offset="13014497">We respectfully submit that whether 241 be restricted to federal type rights, or whether we say that the conduct charge does not come within the protected guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment is exactly the same result whether the conduct charged comes within the guarantee of whether the 241 be restricted, amounts to the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.947" offset="13127137">If 241 is unrestricted, we feel like in effect, it would amount to an amendment of the Fourteenth Amendment by extending 241.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.019" offset="13175411">In that regard, we feel like that in effect, it would amount to the samething as adding the word “person” in the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.859" offset="13206758">In the appellees' brief on page 3, the Fourteenth Amendment first section is cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.758" offset="13238418">And with permission, we read to make our analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.046" offset="13247509">“No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.252" offset="13328384">If we do not restrict 241 and extend it to protect the guarantee, it would in effect change it to this effect -- no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State or person deprive any other person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.140" offset="13455966">We respectfully submit that in regard to 242 and 371 which reaches private individuals whether they act with officers or not in violation of 242, that the answer is if the penalty is not great enough in 242 or 371 rather than to try to reach a felony in Section 241, that the answer is an amendment in regard to the penalty of 242 and 371 making felonies of those sections rather than to extend 241 and try to make it reach the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.679" offset="13646137">Whether it would be the obligation of a nation, state, or an individual, perhaps a simple analogy could be used here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.594" offset="13677798">For argument's sake, let's say that A, B, or C are guaranteed to protect him from B.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.391" offset="13724923">But D comes in and harms C.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.868" offset="13746866">It's obvious that it does not come within the guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.227" offset="13768286">The guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment is that the state B will not encroach upon the right of the individual in regard to equal protection of the law and due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.431" offset="13837145">But whether or not the conduct charged in the indictment comes within the guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment of whether it restrict 241 to federal type rights, in result, it's exactly the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3827.140" offset="15411911">Then, the Government contends here that the because of the aiding and abetting statute regardless of the fact that the indictment did not refer to the aiding and abetting statute that the indictment on number 60 as against the private individual should've been allowed to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.576" offset="15477635">We respectfully submit that the District Court was dealing simply with the interpretation of the indictment and not a construction of the statute in that regard and if the District Court was bidding with an interpretation of the indictment that on direct appeal, it is not been properly before the Court in case number 60, and that the Court should not take jurisdiction of the case in number 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.667" offset="15598007">In our minds, it's crystal clear that section 242 clearly reaches the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee having to do with action under color of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.381" offset="15644923">And that coupled with of 371 which makes the private individual vulnerable to the prosecution under general conspiracy to violate 242, and that without any overlapping, certainly, we feel that it was not the intention of the Congress that 241 and 242 deal with the exact same violation and that personally prosecuted twice for the exact same thing which is protected in regard to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.288" offset="15788492">But without overlapping, the officers can be prosecuted as the District Court held under 242 that the private individual should be prosecuted under general conspiracy of 371 which is -- in cases, is a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.333" offset="15848678">In this case, it would not be because the object of 371 is 242, a misdemeanor, and therefore the charge against all of the defendants under 371 in this particular instance has to do with a felony -- oh excuse me, had to do with misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.913" offset="15911058">But it could, in other cases, have to do with the felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.906" offset="15922970">But without overlapping, we have 242 as to the action under color of law in regard to the officers, and 371 as to the individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.691" offset="15966124">Now, if the indictment had been properly drawn and directed that they could be prosecuted, that private individuals under 242 also by the aiding and abetting statute, they can be prosecuted then on the substantive charge under 242 along with the officers, and all the officers and the private individuals prosecuted under 371 for general conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.847" offset="16066748">Then if we do not restrict 241 to federal type rights, it's simply in effort to increase the punishment to go back and pickup 241, a felony charged to seek to prosecute them, all the defendants, for exactly what it had been covered in 242 and 371 and under the aiding and abetting statute under 242 also.</text>
