            <label>Mr. Solicitor General Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">-- highly relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.534" offset="119578">We view the statute only as it bears on American citizens now residing on the mainland who are educated in Spanish language schools in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.825" offset="172763">And it's the only question presented by this case, and it is as a practical matter, probably the only application of Section 4 (e) that will ever arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.602" offset="223859">We first rely on Article 4, Section 3 of our Constitution which provides, “That Congress shall have power to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory belonging to the United States”.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.454" offset="295225">And the Treaty of Paris in 1898 by which Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States provides specifically at the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of Puerto Rico shall be determined by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.530" offset="375578">And this was implemented over and over again by granting citizenship in 1917 to the residents of that territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.443" offset="411209">The question here is whether Congress is now powerless to effectuate its policy with respect to Puerto Ricans who moved to the mainland by providing a shield against state laws which disqualify them from voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.719" offset="484248">And getting to this, I emphasize two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.728" offset="504310">The fact that Spanish yesterday and has for several decades been the language of instruction in Puerto Rican schools, is ultimately directly attributable to the Congress of the United States, which while it had direct control of the educational policy of Puerto Rico, did make a slight effort to impose English as a predominant language but abandoned that effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.122" offset="621861">And with the knowledge of the consequences, gave the control to locally elected officials knowing full well that those officials would continue to use Spanish as the language in schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.755" offset="676404">And in 1952, the agreement was made and so as of that date on, there was no question that Congress deliberately set upon the path of having Spanish to be the language spoken in the Puerto Rican public schools.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="161.949" offset="753204">General, on what -- about what time did the -- that Congress first recognized that the rights of Puerto Rico to conduct schools in Spanish?</text>

            <label>Mr. Solicitor General Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="179.632" offset="823944">It was when we had charge of it back in the -- after the Jones Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="184.548" stopTime="184.880">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="184.548" offset="843588">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="solicitor_general_marshall" startTime="184.880" stopTime="543.080">
            <label>Mr. Solicitor General Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="184.880" offset="844946">We tried to get them to put in English of the predominant language.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.287" offset="866576">And the reports came back, I don't remember the exact date but the reports came back that would -- dissented in 1946 but the reports came back that it was not working.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.095" offset="929792">You couldn't establish a bilingual school system because the large percentage of the community, the home and everything spoke Spanish, and the only time the youngsters spoke English was in school.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.303" offset="986634">And so they've just abandoned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.918" offset="993113">They did make some people say, “I have hardly attempt”, but an attempt was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.595" offset="1011816">And in 1946, it was just abandoned completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.905" offset="1041074">And finally in 1952, we get to the point of the absolute freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.008" offset="1073465">The fact that we had control of this policy and the fact that we knew exactly what we were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.751" offset="1112440">And in addition, encouraged the Puerto Ricans to come over to the mainland was a responsibility that Congress recognized in considering whether or not it would adopt 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="266.729" offset="1172313">And the fact that Puerto Ricans have come to the mainland particularly to New York City and nearby areas in large numbers, is likewise attributable to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.487" offset="1223408">They have even charged by the treaty of cession with determination of the civil and political rights of the people in Puerto Rico granted them their citizenship as far back in 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.675" offset="1284117">After that, this was when they encouraged them to come to the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.619" offset="1303865">The upshot is that Congress is largely responsible for the present predicament of Puerto Ricans residing in the States who are educated and otherwise qualified to vote but who are denied the voice in the political process solely because they do not read and write English.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.480" offset="1383382">It was therefore quite natural that Congress should feel a moral obligation to remedy a problem of its own making when the affected states declined to solve it themselves, and New York refused to it even though several bills were introduced in the last few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.677" offset="1456107">The legislative history, I submit, is clear that Congress acted in this exact spirit.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.621" offset="1483901">Now the effect of the legislation is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.883" offset="1500933">Section 4 (e) does not overwrite the state literacy laws even for Puerto Ricans.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.053" offset="1529668">Insofar as the State choose to limit their electorate to those who demonstrate by educational achievement the requisite intelligence and knowledge to participate in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.818" offset="1580659">Section 4 (e) respects that.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.902" offset="1597064">In a moment, we'll take up the one arguable point objection that it permits voting by persons, of course, he cannot read and write, cannot keep abreast of what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.628" offset="1643980">Indeed Section 4 (e) does -- opposes no serious administrative problems and this is particularly true in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.576" offset="1691732">This law, 4 (e), was tailored to the law of New York, which was the most directly affected state.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.502" offset="1723392">No Spanish literacy test is required to be administered and New York doesn't have to workout a test or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.082" offset="1753799">The Spanish speaking Puerto Ricans are permitted to prove their literacy only by demonstrating but they've completed the sixth grade, which is the same grade incidentally in English, in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.711" offset="1812313">Now, Section 4 (e) has an appreciable impact in only parts of four other states -- three other states; California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.187" offset="1858184">And there it does not produce any uninformed voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.317" offset="1878664">Although 19 states have some kind of English literacy qualification for voting, only the four name have a Puerto Rican population exceeding 5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.699" offset="1928192">When there is a substantial Spanish speaking population, there are also as one would expect Spanish language newspapers and radio, and television programs to inform that growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.894" offset="1985034">For example, in New York, there are three old Spanish newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.563" offset="2007709">There are three old Spanish radio stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.483" offset="2023382">There are indeed Spanish speaking television programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.767" offset="2040519">And although it's not directly involved in this case, we show that in California, there's one wholly Spanish daily newspaper, two other parts Spanish weeklies, 68 radio stations with some Spanish language programs including five wholly devoted to Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.341" offset="2122752">And the political candidates in affidavits clearly in the record show that there had not any difficulty in getting a story over to Spanish-speaking people either in New York or Connecticut or indeed in Texas and California.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.462" offset="2187222">Thus, as I see it, Section 4 (e) works only a slight impingement on state voting qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.349" offset="2218778">It is not in exercise of federal power writing raw shot over local laws but rather a careful and reasonable accommodation that respects in every possible way, legitimate local preferences.</text>

            <text syncTime="658.701" offset="2740182">Well I -- I -- it pairs to me that Congress was very hesitant of putting any burden on the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.573" offset="2767663">That would require the State to do something more for the Spanish speaking citizen than for the English speaking citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.467" offset="2795248">And it's up to the Spanish speaking citizen to get his information from Spanish speaking sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.366" offset="2822834">And if the affidavit is all showing in the record that in areas where they have large Spanish speaking population, the candidates find a way of getting their story over by putting it to advertisement and et cetera in the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.099" offset="2885841">So I think as of today, I don't know about years ago, but as of today, the Spanish speaking citizen could be just as well advised as to English.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.462" offset="2947281">They rely on their newspapers, I imagine, and they rely on their radio and television station just like so many of our voters do.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.077" offset="2989704">In the -- on the question of the power of Congress, in the absence of prohibitory federal legislation, it is of course clear that the states may condition the right to vote upon reasonable literacy tests if they do not discriminate against the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.749" offset="3076430">On the other hand, it is equally well settled that states do not have an absolute prerogative to regulate the franchise as they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.178" offset="3122092">Their right to fix voting qualifications is subject to constitutional limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.733" offset="3148319">And it could be no question about it now when we look at Carrington and Rash, Louisiana State, Harper against Virginia, and more recently South Carolina against Katzenbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.358" offset="3198892">The only question is whether assuming New York's rule is otherwise constitutional Congress nevertheless has power to qualify it in the prevailing circumstances of the people that have come from Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.491" offset="3271408">We find such power in both of the provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.374" offset="3282902">One, that Territorial Clause I mentioned a while ago and two, Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.791" offset="3316548">And we believe that the two should not be considered separately but we will prefer to view them as complimentary one from the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.399" offset="3358971">There is no question that Puerto Rico was a territory in the full sense until at least 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.671" offset="3396065">And during that time that this Court has said the power of Congress was the broadest possible, indeed, it was plenary, I don't care whether you use the word plenary or not, but it certainly was full.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.930" offset="3453116">And that during that happened in the century was done pursuant to the Territorial Clause including the establishment of the Spanish educational policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.083" offset="3501704">Congress gave them to grant of citizenship and finally the grant of commonwealth status.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.068" offset="3529707">Accordingly, it seems wholly appropriate now to invoke the same source of power, Congress to carry out a policy undertaken in the old territorial days of Puerto Rico by granting Puerto Ricans the immunity from discrimination in voting on account of their language.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.985" offset="3613403">And that resolving the modern problem affect state laws in a modest ways no absolute obstacle.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.049" offset="3641616">In this respect, it seems to us that territorial powers like the power to implement treaty obligations which clearly may override contrary state laws, nor is it a sound objection that Puerto Rico today are commonwealth, certainly it's a commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.981" offset="3717371">The Court need not resolve the exact status of Puerto Rico vis-à-vis commonwealth status.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.776" offset="3744538">For present purposes, it is enough that Puerto Rico is not an independent nation and that Section 4 (e) does not in the least impinge on Puerto Rico's right of self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.003" offset="3797410">Surely, the subsisting force of a Territorial Clause with respect to Puerto Rico is sufficient to authorize this winding up of the Puerto Rican problem on the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.246" offset="3850386">And now on Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and I emphasize we would appreciate consideration of the two priorities together.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.334" offset="3890719">We think that under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress certainly had the power to pass 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="958.274" offset="3938471">And we point out in quite detail in our brief the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, the early post civil war legislation of Congress and the decisions of this Court all indicate that Congress has power, sometimes a duty, to determine the content of equal protection, and that courts are bound to respect such determinations within proper limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.864" offset="4060829">Even if independently they could not invalidate the inconsistent state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.078" offset="4089772">We submit this is a peculiarly appropriate application of that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.017" offset="4117462">Here, Congress is effectuating its policy and correcting a situation of its own creation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.069" offset="4153720">Here, Congress is protecting its formal words toward whom it has special responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.936" offset="4185172">Here, Congress is dealing with the subject matter, the electoral process which is certainly clearly within its area of special comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.776" offset="4232505">We submit that Judge McGowan dissenting below and the three-judge court in the companion Monroe-Kelly case through Judge Kaufmann were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.568" offset="4283705">The constitutional challenge to 4 (e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.452" offset="4315261">The majority opinion below and indeed the appellees in this Court insist that the Lassiter case is the absolute authority for the protection of the New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.852" offset="4384852">And I just went over the Lassiter case again and I found the word ‘English' in one spot, and that was in the footnote quoted in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.248" offset="4430409">There was no question in Lassiter about whether or not the petitioner in that case could speak English.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.962" offset="4469279">Let's assume that if the petitioner was born and raised in North Carolina that has a compulsory educational system, they could speak English.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.567" offset="4511702">The Lassiter case merely passed on the question of a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.222" offset="4538347">And in New York, New York still has the same protection on literacy with or without 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.404" offset="4575023">If the person is born and raised in Puerto Rico in order to vote, that person must be as literate as the English speaking applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.477" offset="4627372">Both have to show at least a sixth-grade certificate in a recognized school one being Spanish and the other being English.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.681" offset="4672094">I believe further as Judge Kaufman said in the Monroe County case that Congress set out to eliminate all vestiges of discrimination into voting process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.261" offset="4754432">Congress dealt appropriately with the problem in the South insofar as a Negro was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.319" offset="4790690">And once advised of the problem in New York, Congress sought to complete the job and make certain that people who were citizens of the United States and who were brought up in Spanish speaking areas on the territory of the United States that they in turn should not be discriminated against solely because of the fact that they could not speak and write and understand English as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.276" offset="4998520">I will seek to try to avoid any repetition of the argument of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.584" offset="5039794">But I would like to indicate to you the great interest of the City of New York in upholding this action of the Congress of the United States in 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.482" offset="5115340">We are dealing in this case with the power of Congress to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.046" offset="5157554">That is the question subject to inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.677" offset="5188169">We find ample power for Section 4 (e) in the Territorial Clause alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.668" offset="5232055">We find ample power for Congress to act in Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.000" offset="5285449">We find ample power in combination of those two provisions to our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.767" offset="5328499">We also find power in the United Nation's Charter Article 55 and the adherence of the United States to that treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.589" offset="5407807">In examining this question, we think that the Court should turn to try to determine what Congress was doing, whether it had the power not whether it was justified in the Act that it undertook.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.411" offset="5655030">However, I don't think that this Court if it found that that particular clause of the Constitution did not sustain the Act, it would stop there under its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.800" offset="5716574">It would always look to the entire framework of the Constitution to find out if Congress had the power any place within that framework to pass this law as a part of its legislative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.412" offset="5799016">So the question is what Congress was doing within its powers?</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.174" offset="5830154">And I think that under the holdings of this Court, the Congress has -- and this Court has recognized, a peculiar power to try to ascertain the extent of the facts and the responsibilities that it should exercise in the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.429" offset="5951154">And turning to that, we must examine the problems that this country had, that Puerto Rico had, that New York and New York City had in connection with this particular matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.084" offset="6029730">Those were the things that Congress was addressing itself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.466" offset="6063271">First, Puerto Rico as a territory was the ward of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.657" offset="6092006">This Court has recognized as has the Congress and the executive of this Government that there is a peculiar responsibility to such wards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.841" offset="6140803">The United States tried with considerable care to develop the system of education that would incorporate the English language as a basic tool of communication for these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.397" offset="6223036">And it found that it wouldn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.477" offset="6235366">It found in fact that it was interfering with the ability of these people to learn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.155" offset="6270056">And it was only after repeated attempts of that kind that the Congress of the United States recognized its failure and decided that the primary consideration for these people was to aid them in the learning that was necessary to be good citizens of Puerto Rico and later of the commonwealth in the development of this area of our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.903" offset="6400982">And therefore, proceeding upon the knowledge that Congress had and the knowledge that it gained from the experience that it went through, yet finally in 1946 abandoned all efforts to try to make these people learn English as the basic tool of communication and learning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.742" offset="6508398">And that was a congressional act carefully undertaken in the light of very difficult experience and knowledge of failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.865" offset="6556881">Now, it appears to us that Congress recognized a responsibility in passing 4 (e) in light of this experience and history of the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.116" offset="6717900">And we had under the supervision of the United States tried to have that appointment made by the executive and the English language taught over a considerable term I think from 1916 on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.688" offset="6788221">And as I recall the history, we even got to the place where the Commissioner of Education gave up and resigned because of the complete failure of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.844" offset="6840780">And we found that we couldn't even get people to hold the office to try to teach these people and develop an adequate learning system and educational program if we try to force English upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.589" offset="6907758">And I assume although I can't document this, that they had to deal with everything around them in their life that was denominated and had Spanish names, Spanish experience, Spanish culture, and they try to convert that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.651" offset="6980065">As we all know, the process of translation back and forth is a difficult one for all us from one language to another while if you can think on the language.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="1761.529" offset="7151532">I think from the Government's brief, it describes the fact on page 16, the difficulties that the Congress had with the whole subject, and finally concluded that it should abandon the efforts to try to teach these people in English, and wouldn't allow them to go back to the Spanish and the Spanish culture as their basic tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.228" offset="7274308">Then of course in 1917 with the Jones Act, the Congress had provided for these people to have citizenship and to be permitted to enter the United States like any other citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.975" offset="7341286">And it is true that it was after this time that the great influx of Puerto Ricans came into New York and particularly New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.998" offset="7389456">I think there were seven or 8000 in earlier period and later it become some 700 or 800,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.218" offset="7426341">I want to stop for a moment where the Court make a claim that the problem is not that large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.647" offset="7452045">The problem is something like 8146, I think who registered under Section 4 (e) in this particular matter and is now involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.046" offset="7505648">It may -- it probably is little larger than that because there is a possibility that others who could register did not as it is always the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.320" offset="7554654">I think that factually in regard to Mr. Justice White's question, the treatment of Spanish speaking people within the New York area is one factor that the Congress seem to be well aware of in connection with the legislation and should be recognized, I think, in the examination of the question by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.487" offset="7663323">The Spanish language papers make a very complete coverage of all political matters in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.631" offset="7703970">They are eager to cover all of the happenings of political action in the New York area and they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.481" offset="7743363">They also cover all of the wire services, they translate them into Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.775" offset="7772515">They set out the various provisions of speeches and constitutional amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.187" offset="7802190">Any other particular political action in Spanish, denominate them so that the Spanish people can find them on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.448" offset="7835209">And there is no question about these people being able to make an intelligent use of the ballot even though they are Spanish speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.672" offset="7896127">Therefore, I think that that factor is one that is important for this Court to consider in examining whether Congress have the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.464" offset="7943252">And in exercising that power, whether it exercise it within the limits of what Congress may do in considering whether that such legislation is proper to preserve the franchise for this substantial group of people who have been and are the wards of this country in their living within New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.571" offset="8071670">Now, as I read Lassiter, this Court did not say that the States could pass any kind of limiting legislation upon the franchise as far as qualification of voters are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.782" offset="8132587">This Court was addressing itself, as I see Lassiter, to the basic problem of whether or not the voter could exercise an intelligent use of the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.050" offset="8189639">And this Court has addressed itself within the last few years to many problems in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.630" offset="8223911">But if it had not reach that point earlier, we certainly have reached the point today where we recognize that one of the greatest rights any citizen of the United States can have is the right to vote, to participate in a genuine, full, and complete vote on matters, issues, and persons in the electoral process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.161" offset="12874021">And that if this may be as true of the Spanish speaking voter as of the English speaking voter, then Congress may denounce as discriminatory under the Equal Protection Clause whether or not this Court could independently, could say that the Clause independently did this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.511" offset="12951448">That Congress at least under Section 5 can denounce that as discriminatory if it finds that indeed the sixth grade Spanish-speaking education is in terms of assuring what kind of voter you get just as good as a sixth grade English speaking education, is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.314" offset="13050713">And I arrived at that on the assumption that this Court has reached the place where it recognizes qualifications of voters in the light of the fact that the right to vote is so precious under our constitutional system, that such qualifications cannot be made unless they fairly contribute to an intelligent exercise of the ballot of the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.948" offset="13185191">And at any time that the States depart from that kind of a standard, it would not be recognized by this Court as a valid exercise of their function in fixing qualifications.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.902" offset="13524992">Well, it seems to me of recognition that there is more to Section 5 than is found in Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.706" offset="13564280">And that the Congress and the country in adopting the Amendment intended that there'd be more.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.318" offset="13626661">I just like briefly to say that I think in Article 55 of the United Nation Charter, there is further ground in the treaty power of the United States to support this action of the Congress in trying to carry out the obligations that the United States took upon itself in connection with that entire program under that charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.938" offset="13729165">And furthermore in our representing to the United Nations in order to induce it to accept the fact that Puerto Rico had different status than mandated or other special colonial or that type of relationships when we represented to them that Puerto Rico was a commonwealth and that we would conduct our relationships in accordance with that standard and that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.523" offset="13879526">And therefore, the United Nations proceeded to decide that it was not in a character of other country's territories that were subject to its other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.851" offset="13940861">And under that treaty power, the United States did take this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.153" offset="13962073">It presented it to the United Nations and upon that ground, the United Nations acted and we think it recognized an obligation there to try to carry out the fact that it had agreed under Article 5 not to discriminate against people because of the language they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.350" offset="14050785">Therefore, may I suggest to the Court that there is ample ground on the three provisions of the Constitution that I've suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.939" offset="14093208">The Court will look at the entire Constitution with all of the amendments, find the power that Congress had the power that the only issue here and it is one more step in our trying to help people of this country to participate in the electoral process where their greatest rights lie.</text>

            <text syncTime="3545.773" offset="14288499">Let me present my respectful greetings to this Honorable Court as I appear before you for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.696" offset="14324234">The facts in these cases are undisputed and they have been adequately presented to the Court by it two distinguish solicitors that have preceded me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.907" offset="14369061">Therefore, I will not belabor the facts but I will go directly to the matters which bring the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.633" offset="14415976">The relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States dates back to the closing of the 19th century when Spain ceded the Ireland to the United States as a result of the Spanish-American War.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.445" offset="14479193">A territorial government was established by Congress in 1900 in the exercise of its territorial powers under the powers it derived from the Treaty of Paris.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.696" offset="14536244">In the insular cases, this Court characterized Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory belonging to but not a part of the United States and as such, under the plenary powers of Congress to legislate for the Ireland on turmoil by the provisions of the Constitution generally applicable to the state and Federal Government as a body in union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.632" offset="14687963">In 1917, the Congress passed an organic act which granted Puerto Rico a wider measure of self-government and which granted American citizenship to the citizens of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.086" offset="14749717">As a result of this legal relationship, an increasing number of Puerto Ricans began to migrate into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.511" offset="14791513">This migration has continued to the present when there are almost 900,000 Puerto Ricans who are settled in the 50 states of the union with concentration in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.508" offset="14855461">When the United States first assumed its responsibilities over Puerto Rico, it attempted to establish English as a language of instruction in Puerto Rican schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.796" offset="14908646">Cultural realities soon forced an abandonment of this policy and Spanish was increasingly used as the educational medium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.016" offset="14953472">As a result, the Puerto Ricans who migrated into the United States brought with them a Spanish cultural and educational background.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.173" offset="15002164">All of these prevailed throughout the period which extended up to 1952 during which the Congress retained plenary powers over Puerto Rico and during which the Commissioner of Education who set the policy regarding the language of instruction was a presidential appointee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.351" offset="15106863">In 1952, the former legal relationship of Puerto Rico as dependent territory to the United States came to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.972" offset="15145315">The Congress enabled the Puerto Rican people to ordain and establish their own government through a written constitution which gave Puerto Rico exclusive control over its local affairs among which was the education of its people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.253" offset="15226399">The newly governed relationship that evolved has become known as a compact of association between Puerto Rico and the United States, the nature of this status is not one of the matters that are in issue before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.853" offset="15304871">This new status permitted the United States to secure exemption from the United Nations' supervision over Puerto Rico as colonial territory and pursuant to Article 73 (e) of Chapter 11 of the United Nations Charter, it was necessary to assure the United Nations among other things that Puerto Ricans were not subjected to having any dominant language imposed upon them as a condition to enjoin the basic rights of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.127" offset="15457949">Under the cultural autonomy guaranteed by the new status, Puerto Ricans have been educated completely in the Spanish language and English has been taught as a second language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.353" offset="15510821">The net result of this policy has been that Puerto Ricans with only grade school or some even with high school education are not functional literates in the English language though they are so in the Spanish language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.174" offset="15578112">The new status had preserved the common American citizenship for the Puerto Ricans and the freedom of movement to and from the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.396" offset="15623043">The migratory pattern has continued and a circular movement of persons from Puerto Rico to the States and back to Puerto Rico is an ever present characteristic of the Puerto Rican-American Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.225" offset="15686363">Presently there are about 730,000 Puerto Ricans living in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.194" offset="15718233">About 400,000 -- 480,000 are of voting age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.289" offset="15742579">Less than one-third of these or approximately 150,000 are registered to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.711" offset="15776225">There are no exact figures as to how -- how many of the unregistered 330,000 are literate in the Spanish language but it is perhaps relevant to point out in this connection that the literacy rate in Puerto Rico is 83%.</text>

            <text syncTime="4264.438" offset="17163222">Historically, both the Congress and the federal judiciary have been called upon to enforce the amendment by decision or by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.423" offset="17203137">In this case, it was the Congress who took the initiative to relieve the Puerto Ricans of the unequal burden put upon them by the laws of New York; that decision of Congress is entitled to all due respect from the judiciary we just customarily granted the legislative branch wide latitude in making these judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.085" offset="17309717">In this case, the Congress assessed a number of factors especially suited to a legislative and political judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.828" offset="17348692">Let me state what they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.826" offset="17360708">The relationship of Puerto Rico to the United States, the international commitments of the United States, the grant of American citizenship to the Puerto Rican people, the substantial migration of Puerto Ricans into the United States, the cultural autonomy of Puerto Rico fostered by Congress, the struggle of the migrant Puerto Ricans in the United States to integrate into their mainstream of American social economic and political life, and most important of all, the reasonableness of the requirement of English literacy as it bears upon the intelligent use of the franchise in the linguistic environment of New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.086" offset="17581808">Having weighed all these factors, Congress concluded that it was necessary to correct the legislation of New York in order to strike out the inequality which resulted for the literate American citizen educated in an American flag school in Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.564" offset="17659653">This judgment is fair and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.289" offset="17674595">And the result in legislation is entirely within the bounds of the fifth section of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.596" offset="17715764">This construction of the Constitution which the Court is called upon to make today would permit the Congress the necessary latitude to deal with justice towards the people with whom the country is associated in a bond of friendship, mutual respect, and good will.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.685" offset="17800192">As technological progress brings all the people well closer and ideological differences tend to divide them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4466.931" offset="17973123">If Your Honors please, I do not intend to argue today the reasonableness of the New York statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.048" offset="18005619">I leave this to the Attorney General of New York and to the first assistant and the learned Assistant Attorney General who will argue after me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.024" offset="18045534">I intend to spend my time first on the power over the territories briefly and then to go into what I feel are the very large questions about the Fourteenth Amendment very basic and broad questions which I believe that this statute raises.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.078" offset="18125782">In view of the fact that they were shortly be frank, I will go into the power over the territories first because I intend to talk about that only very briefly before I go into the Fourteenth Amendment on which the statute is purportedly based.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.491" offset="18199343">Now, I start out with the proposition that there is a distinction between local or state or municipal sovereignty, I prefer to call it municipal sovereignty and national sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.496" offset="18255454">The United States have had territories since 1789 or before that, the Northwest Territories which have been considered to be in wardship of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.646" offset="18304042">Under the power of the Territorial Clause, it is my contention that Congress exercises only what we call municipal sovereignty, a sovereignty which is substituted for state sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.118" offset="18349913">In fact the identical sovereignty, which the states exercised as distinguished from national sovereignty under other powers of the Federal Government which Congress has exercised to both the territories and the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.004" offset="18413443">And that any power under national sovereignty must be found elsewhere other than in the Territories Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.091" offset="18441759">Now, the Department of Justice has argued and made much of that I believe that in other instances, Congress has exercised extraterritorial power of the territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.616" offset="18499856">I concede that point but so have the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.193" offset="18522216">Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, state law sometimes has extraterritorial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.428" offset="18555131">Hughes against Fetter is a recent and fairly good example of this, I would think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.672" offset="18584074">And my contention is that Congress has power over the territory in giving extraterritorial effect in the identical circumstances that a state law would have extraterritorial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.648" offset="18655963">And at the same type of a state law would be upheld as it would be upheld under the Territorial Clause -- Territorial Clause in respect to its act of territorial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.807" offset="18704656">If this were otherwise, it would follow that when a territory which was always considered to be in temporary wardship became a state, it would follow that a citizen of the State would lose rights that he had previously enjoyed under a statute under the Congress' power to govern the territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.114" offset="18797861">Be specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.908" offset="18801100">Let us assume that Puerto Rico became a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.817" offset="18812698">Thereafter, Congress could not pass the statute because it's under the Territories Clause, because in respect to that, it would have no more power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.789" offset="18868600">Accordingly, citizens of Puerto Rico who moved to New York would lose rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.688" offset="18892215">And I think it anomalous to think that under a Territories Clause, persons who move from one state -- persons who are citizens of a territory gain statehood status go down in their rights rather than up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.997" offset="18953446">I think it were always deemed the citizens of territories certainly had no greater rights than citizens of States, whatever left the rights, whatever the question of whether they have left the rights or not which I don't think it's necessary to go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.698" offset="19008199">They certainly had no greater rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.411" offset="19023036">Now, I look at the question this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.782" offset="19032545">What would happen if the State of Louisiana passed the law saying that all citizens of Louisiana educated in the French language who moved to the State of New York or to some other state which had an English language literacy test, would be entitled to vote provided they have the same level of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.216" offset="19110285">Now, I think it's crystal clear that if one state passed such a law, it would not be enforceable in another state under the Full Faith and Credit Clause because I do not think that a state can give its own law extraterritorial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.881" offset="19172979">Therefore, I conclude, that if that is so, the identical point follows in respect to a law of Congress under the Territories Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.846" offset="19232852">Accordingly, the point I therefore make is, that Congress could not as he said it and didn't say it was but could not, have passed the statute under the Territories Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.265" offset="19282484">And for this reason, even if it were permissible to consider this statute merely under the Territories Clause, a point which I do not, even if it was permissible to do so, the statute would not be valid under the Territories Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.836" offset="19352806">For the reason, that is an excess of Congress' power to pass because it is not an exercise of municipal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.622" offset="19387914">It is not an exercise of legislation similar to a statute for example which says that a gas in a -- an automobile who had an accident in Puerto Rico who was guilty of contributory negligence could not recover against the host.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.632" offset="19439950">New York of course, would probably require to enforce that under full faith and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.953" offset="19457191">And that I can see that the Supremacy Clause simply carries over the notion of a Full Faith and Credit Clause in respect to this matter to which it is the identical type of clause in respect to this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="4901.240" offset="19710370">In my estimation, the reason I'm not discussing that is because I conceive that the Treaty Clause gives Congress no independent power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.039" offset="19749554">And that if the treaty is outside of the general scope of Congress' power elsewhere, Congress cannot increase its power by making a treaty with the foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.396" offset="19791036">I believe that Your Honors observe this fact in Reid against Covert and therefore, I do not believe in accordance with long settled precedent and I think in accordance with the general nature of the Government that the treaty power is not a grant of substantive power above and beyond that which Congress is allowed in those foreign affairs which would have by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.574" offset="19903676">Therefore, I will not argue -- and in addition, as I believe I've mentioned before, I will not argue the question of reasonableness of the New York statute leaving it to the Attorney General of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.399" offset="19963026">I might note preliminarily that the Department of Justices' briefs has a great many statistics on Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.088" offset="20001792">I believe that the habit of using statistics in briefs started with Muller against Oregon by the late Mr. Justice Brandeis that of an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.776" offset="20040558">And I think has increased to the point in which appendices and now all statistics and no constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.772" offset="20068456">As Your Honors know, I have made a distinct departure from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.400" offset="20082981">My appendix contains all constitution in those statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.707" offset="20100221">And I leave to the Attorney General of New York and to the Department of Justice the question of, how many immigrants there was average annual rainfall in Puerto Rico and also with some other statistics which in my estimation are wholly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.809" offset="20164692">The general question, as I conceive it, is what was the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment, in questions of this character?</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.034" offset="20201576">Before I go into that, I intend to got start out which I consider to be a useful starting point with the Dred Scott case which was cited by Judge McGowan below but in a somewhat different context that I am going to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.909" offset="20269077">I might say that I consider these questions fundamental and as broad as the hills and not nearly as narrow as I believe my learned opponents contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.937" offset="20317142">First of all, what were the questions decided in the Dred Scott case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.303" offset="20334592">One, the Missouri compromises unconstitutional because in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.955" offset="20361237">Two, that Negroes were not citizens under Article 4 Section 2 of the old Interstate Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.030" offset="20393524">Both of these decisions were contrary to what I call egregious historical facts notwithstanding the fact that of the present time it is believe that they were supposed to be in accordance with history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.627" offset="20459980">Now, the two things the Radical Republicans cited to show that these decisions were contrary to egregious historical facts were one, as to the Fifth Amendment the fact of the Northwest Ordinance which it could not be presumed Congress intended to repeal by the Fifth Amendment is almost contemporaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.053" offset="20537616">And two, in respect to Article 4 Section 2, the fact that in June 25th, 1778 South Carolina delegation moved to insert the word ‘white' in the premises of Privileges and Immunities Clause and this was defeated by a vote of eight to two with one state divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.900" offset="20613057">Now, the radicals charged and repeatedly throughout the congressional of debates that the Dred Scott decision was not in fact a judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.707" offset="20664257">That it was a political decision designed to support the Buchanan version of a great society and slave holding ideology.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.569" offset="20707725">And that it was designed to one, commit the extension of slavery into the territories; and two, most important in respect to Article 4 Section 2, which is necessary to an understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment, was designed to keep free Negroes who were believed to be the natural leaders of slavery out of sovereign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.574" offset="20783689">And I think the horror incident which Your Honors may remember in 1844 is a good example of the dread which the sovereign states have for having freed Negroes declared citizens under Article 4 Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.952" offset="20841263">Now, what was the radical reaction to this?It was, in blunt terms that the Tory court, were making political speeches to support the Buchanan and Pierce administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.028" offset="20897583">Now, when the Radical swept into power, the political tide turned, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.300" offset="20934572">And the political supports of this Court as an institution were withdrawn and decisions how to stand on the question of whether they were on the bedrock of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.596" offset="20991833">And I think history supports my position that what the Tory -- or the position of the Radical but what the Tory court did was to mortgage the political future of the Court with the then current ideology, which when swept away, swept away the only assets that this Court had to with the prestige among lawyers of all political factions based on decisions, based on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.986" offset="21109384">And once those mortgages were foreclosed, the Court was left without assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.470" offset="21135297">Of the political nature, of course, Congress retained its power over the person, the executive over the sword that this Court has nothing but power over the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.306" offset="21182631">And I think the Radicals in their speech has pointed out, that as long as this Court -- that as long as the political branches of the Government support this Court's position that the question of whether it makes decisions based on the law, current ideology is irrelevant, but that it needs us -- withdrawn by a change in ideological occurrence, the result is that decisions are swept away.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.087" offset="21297779">And the Court -- the decisions are then exposed to the gaze of whether they are based on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.079" offset="21341769">And the fact that the Tory court did in fact shore -- shear itself with the power to do anything is I think exemplified an ex parte Merryman where the Lincoln administration tore up Mr. Justice Taney's writs and used as it a confetti and in ex parte McCardle where the radical congress simply barred this Court from many review.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.746" offset="21424421">A very legitimate one is protecting the South against the excess of reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.787" offset="21464545">Now, I want to say to Your Honors very respectfully that I see analogies to that case today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5347.722" offset="21496310">And I want to say that in this case, there are egregious historical facts which support the position that I take that the Fourteenth Amendment covers only what were known in 1866 as civil rights and not political rights at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.687" offset="21572169">These facts are contained in approximately 100 pages of legislative history appendix which I have filed with Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.768" offset="21616473">And I will say that I think it would be necessary for the Department of Justice to burn the congressional gloss if they would convince anybody that the original understanding was in accordance with this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.669" offset="21676136">Now, I believe what is ultimately at stake is the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment itself which is Your Honor may know rests on the historical compromises of 1876 and '94 in which the South generally agreed not to contest ratification in return for a construction which was strictly in accordance with the original understanding which is very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.427" offset="21791180">I think Erie Railroad Company against Tompkins and the opinion of the late Mr. Justice Brandeis is a prototype of what happens, because in that case, the flowering of Swift against Tyson, as I see it in response to the needs of big business after the civil war, and I think I may say the excesses under that decision was such as to lay the groundwork for an examination of the original understanding, and of course, the tail going with the head the Fifteenth Amendment ratification rests with the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.775" offset="21932554">Now, I feel entirely justified in saying that this statute cuts a deep gash in the original understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.950" offset="21977172">And it is back from where I want to go to and that to which I want to spend my time, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.066" offset="22013639">And I would like to make my position as clear as I can in respect to this question of original understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.431" offset="22039134">I do not view the Fourteenth Amendment as an accordion which expands or contracts in respect of who's playing the tune.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.253" offset="22070481">I view it in respect as a fixed document.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.507" offset="22091483">And my position is that the beginning, middle, and end of all constitutional inquiry is the original understanding of the framers and of the legislative debates are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.958" offset="22141221">They are conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5510.636" offset="22148012">Cases in the Court are superfluous and those contraries are erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.336" offset="22166716">And for this reason, I intend to go to the original understanding and to that alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.180" offset="22198168">Now, I would start out by saying that trying to vote the statute on the Equal Protection Clause is like trying to carry the Washington Monument in the wheelbarrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.869" offset="22236933">Your Honors cannot make it fit because the Equal Protection Clause is much too narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.815" offset="22264728">It would -- in my estimation, it would require a plastic surgery on the Equal Protection Clause to sustain the statute then I --</text>

            <text syncTime="5632.348" offset="22634830">The Department of Justice cited in support of those cases the Enforcement Act of 1870.</text>

            <text syncTime="5644.189" offset="22682164">As reported out and passed in the houses, it was reported out from the Judiciary Committee of the House shared by Congressman John A.

            <text syncTime="5656.102" offset="22729812">It would made -- it was made a criminal offense for state officials to fail to collect poll taxes from Negroes.</text>

            <text syncTime="5712.062" offset="22953629">There are -- the Due Process Clause I don't think anybody considers to be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.554" offset="22967630">I've seen nothing that anybody can see the irrelevance so I deal with the Privileges and Immunities Clause and which granted privilege and immunities of citizens of the United States to citizens only and equal protection which is granted to all persons, a distinction which I think is very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.798" offset="23064597">Now, I start out by detailing what I believe the original understanding of the word ‘protection'.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.040" offset="23097616">Now this is the keyword.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.138" offset="23105975">Not equal, it doesn't mean equal rights, equal benefits, equal privileges, it means equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5758.030" offset="23137531">It doesn't mean the equal protect -- it doesn't mean the protection of equal law that means the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.814" offset="23160728">Just a pair of alligator is different from an alligator pair.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.947" offset="23181208">The word ‘protection' comes from the original draft of Bingham speech and Bingham's draft, giving Congress the power to enforce the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States derived from Article 4 Section 2 and Equal Protection of life, liberty and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.578" offset="23279741">And Bingham speeches, I think read carefully show that it meant protection of the right to life which is every person even an alien baby is entitled so you couldn't take the life of a baby.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.515" offset="23359467">Protection of liberty which I think every person is entitled to and protection of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.636" offset="23387993">And Bingham speeches show it meant property acquired lawfully and obtained lawfully personal property, as in the cases like Roth against Slaughter which he has cited in his original speeches.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.662" offset="23436058">So Your Honors originally, protection, the Equal Protection Clause was designed not only for aliens, for travelers, for resident aliens, for everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.905" offset="23485064">That's why the word ‘person' is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5847.296" offset="23494572">And of course I might say this that under the original concept of the Equal Protection Clause, no reasonable classification is necessary because every -- I think one can conceive that every person is entitled to the same protection of life, liberty, and property which every other person is entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5869.316" offset="23582657">In other words, what I'm suggesting is that the Equal Protection Clause has nothing whatever to do with this case as far as its original understanding is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.302" offset="23622677">That is to say it is confined exactly, it was merely a redraft, Your Honors may recall that the Bingham draft was postponed in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.666" offset="23664055">It was postponed because the majo -- many of the Republicans, Hutchinson and Hale and other Republican congresses felt it gave Congress too much power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.690" offset="23700208">So it was postponed and redrafted to be a negative limitation on the State similar to the limitation which the old sec -- limitations of Article 1 Section 10 were.</text>
            <text syncTime="5916.257" offset="23770425">Therefore, in my estimation the Equal Protection Clause has nothing whatever to do at all with this case of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5925.836" offset="23808773">I take that broad ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.986" offset="23817341">I realized the broader ground than perhaps it's been put forth in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5934.803" offset="23844613">But I think it's the correct ground when one goes back to be with you on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.453" offset="23871258">Now, let me give some illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5946.349" offset="23890798">In 1870, the Enforcement Act was passed, just passed largely to protect Chinese in California who were not permitted to be witnesses in cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.534" offset="23931549">And the right to be a witness was a protection because of course, if a person could not be a witness, it means -- and some of these speeches show that he could be robbed with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.340" offset="23986824">And therefore, it was necessary to protect him in this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.026" offset="24013573">This is part, I think, of the word ‘protection'.</text>
            <text syncTime="5980.101" offset="24025799">I therefore deem that reasonable classification has nothing to do with the Equal Protection Clause at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.927" offset="24049100">Now, I turn to what I considered to be the more important clause, to which the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5991.686" offset="24072192">Where did it come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.213" offset="24078252">What was it meant to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.839" offset="24100822">Now, the reason for the Privileges and Immunities Clause was the defect in the -- according to Bingham with the defect in the original Constitution that Congress had no power to enforce Article 4 Section 2, that the necessary improper clause that not give it any power to enforce Article 4 Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.178" offset="24190161">Its derogation comes from two different sources, although originally drafted to give Congress that is the concepts, I'm sorry, I shouldn't give the derogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.488" offset="24227359">Derogation comes straight from Article 4 Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="6033.265" offset="24238435">And Bingham speeches indicate very clearly that he believed there was an ellipsis in Article 4 Section 2, unlike the democrats who felt was just designed to prevent a discrimination against out of state residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.664" offset="24296114">He believe that the word of citi -- of the United States should be inserted off to the words ‘privileges', that is so what should the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.551" offset="24343656">And after that of the United States in the several states in of the United States being the ellipsis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.135" offset="24373959">The question therefore boils down to what was Bingham's concept of privileges, where did they get it from.</text>
            <text syncTime="6075.194" offset="24406246">What did they believe it contain because even if it contained something different by the old framers, the questions what went into the Fourteenth Amendment are also one of Radicals believe it contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="6085.981" offset="24449296">I think it's very clear that the Radicals believe that the Privileges and Immunities Clause which is of course broader than the Equal Protection Clause since they were only right for citizens, well how to be a citizen derive any protection from the Privileges and Immunities Clause, protecting what were known an 1866 as civil rights, that is to say not political rights but rather civil rights as we know in 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.205" offset="24550233">Now, I think I am supported by many -- by a multitude in this number of citations which I have in my appendices and which I shall not unless Your Honors are particularly interested to meet legislative appendices which I have filed with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.801" offset="24624630">But I want to call Your Honors' attention for example to a footnote which I added, to the report of the joint committee on reconstruction of 1866, which I think shows very clearly that the Fourteenth Amendment was reported out to protect only civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.705" offset="24704251">Civil rights at that time were believed to be what are known as today as natural rights, or that is to what -- I'm sorry what were known then as natural rights today's concept of natural rights might be a good deal of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.090" offset="24765795">But they were intended to protect what were known at that time as natural rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6171.258" offset="24790455">And they were derived from two sources one, the decision of this that Justice Washington on the circuit in 1823 in Corfield against Coryell, which I assume is Your Honors are all familiar with then I shall go through, and two, protections existing already in the Constitution itself, that is all the privileges and immunities were deemed to be those protections which existed in the Constitution, protection against bills of attainder, and so forth, and many protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.487" offset="24923366">I don't want to get into this discussion between if there's a (Inaudible) and there's a famine about whether all the bills of rights or just part where -- but I think at least some of it whether it's the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6218.442" offset="24979163">I don't think any of them went to Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6220.823" offset="24988672">But I think it all went to Privileges and Immunities Clause and for this authority I cite a statement by Senator Pomeroy in 1870 that aliens have no right to petition the United States Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6231.320" offset="25030677">It was a privilege of citizens alone, one of the many aspects I think which shed light as far as the original understanding of the framers are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.455" offset="25071219">Now, at that what were considered to be civil rights the right to work, the right to travel, the right to raise a family, the right to do business, to buy and sell and own property, that is what were considered an -- and have security therefore, the right to bring a suit, lawsuit, or the things that were considered in 1866 to be civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.892" offset="25192950">Among the things excluded for what we known as conventional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6277.197" offset="25214161">And I might say again I'm supported in this if Your Honors may know of the colloquy that Senator Lyman Trumbull, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1872, hired with Senator George Edmund, member of the Judiciary Committee in which he said that this was confined to civil rights and does not include the right to go to school, does not include the right to vote, does not include any conventional rights, it just included what were known as basic or natural rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6301.745" offset="25312381">Now, I suppose the question must be asked, why not -- why then put this back into Article 4 Section -- if it's Article 4 Section 2, why put it in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6316.845" offset="25372776">The short answer was that as part of the guarantees, post civil war guarantees, Cong -- the radical congress demanded that the South give it the power to enforce in full these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.544" offset="25451562">Now, that brings me to the fifth section which I believe has been argued at some length in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.922" offset="25489074">My position as to the fifth section is I think quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.836" offset="25504747">The power to enforce does not include the power to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="6353.927" offset="25521152">The power to enforce does not include the power to define.</text>
            <text syncTime="6357.465" offset="25535258">The power to enforce is simply the power to enforce what is in the other section.</text>
            <text syncTime="6361.711" offset="25552290">In fact, there were some arguments by the democrats, the power to enforce had nothing to do with its first section at all because it was the third section, a really controversial section, which Congress demanded the power to enforce as Spevack confederates out of public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6380.315" offset="25626687">Now, my contention is that since in 1866 and 1868, states were free under the Fourteenth Amendment to make up such qualifications for voting the date it shows, that they have the identical freedom today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.025" offset="25709547">That is to say that Constitution -- principles of the Constitution remains fixed until amended in the manner, the precise manner which is set out in Article 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.765" offset="25756463">This is what I think is the basic issue in respect to this statute and in respect to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6419.851" offset="25784780">That is to say that the historical intent remains fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.644" offset="25811947">I think I can draw an analogy in this way with a favorite little story by Radical Republicans in 1850, the 1850s about a Vermont judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.483" offset="25879343">They were fond of citing his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6445.724" offset="25888329">He was asked to return a slave under the fugitive slave law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.692" offset="25908182">He demanded proof of ownership which is entitled to under a fugitive slave law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.014" offset="25929498">He was given a bail of sale by the owner but made out by the prior owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6460.612" offset="25947888">He said to the judge that he would only recognize the bill of sale from his maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="6465.511" offset="25967428">And so I say, it was the same thing in respect to the Constitution that the powers must be found under the grounds of the makers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.577" offset="26007761">That is the only place, not of present congressional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6484.041" offset="26041616">Now, in my estimation the statute is such noble theory that it should be patented in the patent office except that I do not know that it would meet this Court's test of utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="6499.433" offset="26103160">But I certainly think that this is the first time that Congress has ever tried to amend the Fourteenth Amendment under the guise of enforcing especially in respect of political rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6515.564" offset="26167630">I might say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6517.285" offset="26174527">I believe in the legislative history appendix which I've submitted, which I wrote the State of Virginia, my also -- my article in Stanford Law Review, and in the appendix which I submitted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.979" offset="26233354">I pointed out very clearly that during the debates on the Fifteenth Amendment, repeating attempts were made to ban states using qualifications based on literacy, property, religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.951" offset="26305243">I might say in respect to religion there was a very raw example because Roman Catholic was forbidden to hold office in the State of New Hampshire, very raw example.</text>
            <text syncTime="6559.874" offset="26344950">One is quite often cited with respect to an English language literacy test, we don't have to look very far.</text>
            <text syncTime="6567.184" offset="26374207">The State of Massachusetts as well as Connecticut had an English language literacy test and its purpose was not as benign as the New York statute is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.851" offset="26416839">Its purpose was to keep out Irish democratic immigrants away from the polling booth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6586.154" offset="26450066">It was a no nothing product.</text>
            <text syncTime="6588.611" offset="26459888">It was kindly talk about during the reconstruction period and yet it was maintained during this entire period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.389" offset="26491026">Rhode Island had a better trick.</text>
            <text syncTime="6599.422" offset="26503147">They require that all naturalized citizens own land in Rhode Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="6604.730" offset="26524359">And as one demo -- Senator Bland said of Missouri, there wasn't very much man in the State of Rhode Island for anybody to own.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.476" offset="26559363">The Rhode Island -- Senator Anthony of Rhode Island said that he wouldn't let the Fourth -- he wouldn't vote for the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6618.941" offset="26581201">The Rhode Island legislature wouldn't ratify unless Congress took out the property qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="6624.110" offset="26601890">That is a ban on property qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="6625.824" offset="26608682">So they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.709" offset="26620280">And in respect to -- in respect to other, the nativity qualification of the West Coast Republicans were dead set against letting any Chinese vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6641.234" offset="26670331">That's why the nativity was taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6643.312" offset="26678690">According to Senator Aaron Sargent, a California Republican, I'm now citing the majority republicans, I'm not citing the democrats for these propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.733" offset="26720381">And so the original draft, the Wilson draft of the Fifteenth Amendment was waddled away.</text>
            <text syncTime="6658.950" offset="26741175">Now, there was a proposed draft in the Fifteenth Amendment to give everybody an equal vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6663.610" offset="26759879">It was the original Bingham draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="6665.967" offset="26769283">And it was defeated very resoundingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6669.475" offset="26783284">Now, if Bingham had put in the Fourteenth Amendment -- the Fourteenth Amendment that everybody is entitled to an equal vote or an equal vote without -- based on a reasonable classification why should he make the same amendment in the Fifteenth two years later superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="6684.616" offset="26843888">I think it defies common sense to say that the original -- original framers who would make all of this enactment absolutely which would absolutely be nonsense in comparison with what they actually did thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6703.736" offset="26920375">That is to say the original debates of 1866 are reinforced by everything that the framers did from one end to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.718" offset="26960290">And it is on this that I rest as to the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6720.109" offset="26985890">The Department of Justice has submitted four little items on which you understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="6725.594" offset="27007833">I believe one of them is a little tidbit from Senator Howard which is I think so broad and vague as virtually meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="6734.213" offset="27042314">I have a material from Senator Howard which I shouldn't read to Your Honors because it's in the appendices that I've filed which shows very clearly repeatedly he said the Fourteenth Amendment had nothing to do with the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6746.981" offset="27093305">In -- they also have a couple of statements by democrats and some of the States saying what a horrible thing this is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="6754.645" offset="27124025">I think they're clearly political speeches and I think we can ignore them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6761.250" offset="27150461">It is not -- the Justice Department's brief does not cite but I think I want to go into for a moment because it's probably familiar to you Your Honor an article by Mr. Ben Allstar in the Law Review Journal -- I'm sorry, the Supreme Court reviewed last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6773.985" offset="27201348">Unfortunately, Mr. Ben Allstar has had unhappy habit of putting a material that he finds favorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6779.879" offset="27224963">I've put in a material in these appendices which are both favorable and a little bit which I deemed to be unfavorable to with Boswell speech, that is Congressman Boswell, right before the enactment of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.728" offset="27284313">There were -- I'm sorry and Senator Edmund.</text>
            <text syncTime="6796.529" offset="27291523">I want to take up these two people because they're the only people who are unfavorable to my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6801.958" offset="27313256">I think really except for the democrats.</text>
            <text syncTime="6804.090" offset="27321825">As for Boswell, I think I can explain this very easily though he -- this admitted to by -- he never practiced law until long after he left the Senate and House.</text>
            <text syncTime="6813.695" offset="27360172">So he really wasn't a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6816.796" offset="27372607">As to Edmunds, though he said originally that the Privileges and Immunities Clause, not the Equal Protection Clause, but Privileges and Immunities Clause did grant Congress some power over the right to vote to with the right to prevent discrimination against Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.989" offset="27425374">Thereafter, he changed his position in 1872 concurred with the rest in saying that Privileges and Immunities Clause had nothing to do with the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6838.607" offset="27459856">And therefore, I take the broad grounds that there is really no substantial material in the debates, it's not a question of weighing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6847.084" offset="27493710">There is no substantial material in the debates which is contrary to the position that the original understanding had nothing whatever to do with anything other than what was known as a civil right in 1866 and 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="6865.064" offset="27565704">And therefore, I prompt my feet firmly on the original understanding -- on the original understanding of these amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.028" offset="27621501">Now, I might say that several of the gentlemen who have preceded me have indicated that they belie --</text>

            <text syncTime="6909.716" offset="27744277">That is to say if one goes back to the mischief, it is not difficult to realize why the word protection was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="6917.250" offset="27774370">Let me give Your Honor an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.099" offset="27781789">A single example I think will suffice both of the use of the word person in the Equal Protection Clause and the use of the word protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6927.894" offset="27817002">In 1850, the Supreme Court of California decided that under the law of California, Chinese were assimilated to Indians and were not permitted to testify in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6940.892" offset="27869038">In 1860, I think it was Mr. Justice Field later in this Court who held that under the law, if a white man beat up a China man and robbed him in California and the only witnesses were Chinese, the white man had to go free.</text>
            <text syncTime="6956.674" offset="27932150">Now, Senator Conness said this is becoming a very serious problem because Southern born confederates became highly men in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="6968.182" offset="27978125">He used another term, I don't remember, and then he said they were just plainly highly men.</text>
            <text syncTime="6971.874" offset="27992963">And what they would do, they go around robbing Chinese and then of course they could never be brought to book because the only witnesses were Chinese and they were excluded as witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6981.174" offset="28030161">Your Honors you may remember, that under the old slave codes, Negroes could not be witnesses where whites were parties whether four against White.</text>

            <text syncTime="7028.369" offset="28218870">I'm afraid to say that it's narrow even than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.488" offset="28231408">That is to say that Privileges and Immunities Clause could be substituted for civil rights and in fact the Civil Rights Act though there's a lot of discussion of debate about where enforcing the Thirteenth Amendment, I think it's very clear and Senator Lot Morrill of 1872 made it quite clear that the civil rights, that the Act of '66 really rested on Article 4 Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="7054.865" offset="28324927">The big quarrels whether Congress could enforce Article 4 Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="7059.245" offset="28342376">That is to say if Negroes were freed, were they therefore ipso facto were entitled to Article -- benefits of Article 4 Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="7068.127" offset="28377903">This -- that's why you have a declaration of citizenship in the -- first sentence of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="7075.346" offset="28406847">Now, the word civil rights was taken out of the Act which Your Honor you may remember because there was a lot of discussion on the subject to whether voting was a civil right and Senator -- Congressman Wilson, the later Senator Wilson, Congressman Wilson of Ireland, Chairman of Judiciary Committee said “No” and then Bingham said “Yes” and what it said, well maybe or maybe it's too broad or Columbus Delano of Ohio said, “This is pretty broad, who knows what's going to be interpreted at.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7098.948" offset="28501201">So Wilson finally said, “Alright, we're going to take the word ‘civil rights' right out in just list the ‘right'.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7104.349" offset="28522830">But my contention of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, you could replace Privileges and Immunities Clause with the word ‘civil rights' which is I say included one, the right in Corfield against Coryell and two, rights derived from the Constitution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.696" offset="28584166">As to the Equal Protection Clause, that's narrow still.</text>
            <text syncTime="7122.349" offset="28594824">Not all civil rights are protected by the Equal Protection Clause just those which give protection to life, liberty, or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="7130.488" offset="28627320">It's a very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="7131.506" offset="28631395">It's a very little clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="7133.113" offset="28637874">I might say that the whole first section was utterly uncontroversial.</text>
            <text syncTime="7137.122" offset="28653861">The second section wasn't very controversial, with the big fight on the third section on whether ex-confederates should be disabled from holding the office but nobody cared about the first section being to surplusage, it was just a little unimportant clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="7149.731" offset="28704329">It's just very basic.</text>

            <text syncTime="7165.934" offset="28769113">It would protect persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="7167.750" offset="28776427">First of all, it would protect aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="7170.281" offset="28786563">It would take travels.</text>
            <text syncTime="7172.478" offset="28795340">In Bingham, as an early as Bingham speech against the admission of Oregon in the 35th Congress second session, I think it was about page 900 something in 1859, he indicates very clear that even strangers are entitled to some protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="7187.217" offset="28854272">And he repeated this recurring theme like a broken record over and over through the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7192.398" offset="28874961">Even strangers get something.</text>
            <text syncTime="7196.284" offset="28890530">In fact, the word ‘persons' have been so broadly interpreted that I might say this, that in President Johnson's veto in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, he makes a point that he conceived the word ‘persons' to include corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7209.572" offset="28943715">So that -- but I think it was considered on all sides that they've included aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="7214.133" offset="28962001">That's the reason for in effect duplicating some of the rights in the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Equal Protection and the Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="7220.497" offset="28987392">Namely, aliens get something because there was the State, it was believed that the State would not protect aliens either even of these basic rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="7229.273" offset="29022501">And I think the State of California is an excellent example.</text>
            <text syncTime="7232.499" offset="29035457">The history of the State of California is an excellent example, the pre-antebellum history of the State of California is an excellent example, and perhaps the post-antebellum to some extent whatever was on the democratic administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="7243.486" offset="29079343">And it was this constant discussion about democratic legislature discriminating against Chinese refusing them protection, refusing them permission to testify even the State is refusing them and some state they couldn't be parties, they couldn't sue the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7256.590" offset="29131797">If the man hits you on the nose, it's tough luck, you couldn't sue in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7262.042" offset="29153635">So if you go back to the original mischief, there is a very good reason for these clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="7269.139" offset="29181952">And my contention is that -- I might say that I consider as a contention of -- a moment where it comes to say contention of the legality, that is to say that it's a requirement of legality that a constitution be interpreted in accordance with the original understanding and not like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7290.112" offset="29265857">They once said in the Alabama lawyer of light check that it has got to be -- it means exactly the same as it meant in 1866, of course, scientific changes simply mean that you substitute one scientific methods for another as an airplane that is same as a train for purposes of general principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="7311.128" offset="29349972">But the general principles remain the same although it was known in 1866, people go to schools were known -- these are -- all these things were known.</text>
            <text syncTime="7318.906" offset="29381005">That is my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="7320.912" offset="29389051">And now I might say that I -- some of the gentlemen on the other side have said that voting -- they think voting is very fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="7330.453" offset="29427190">I don't know that voting is as fundamental as my learned opponent's belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7335.207" offset="29446207">I think the right to drive a car for example is more fundamental than the right to vote because in those places of the country you'd never even get to the polls without a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="7344.439" offset="29483196">And I might say that I think if we took a survey in the country is to whether people would rather hitchhike imposed of pay $1.50 that they'd certainly be glad to pay $1.50 rather than to hitchhike in the polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="7355.841" offset="29528754">Besides which I might say that I think New York City would tax even walking through the polls that it found a way to tax walking and collecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="7365.011" offset="29565430">I think that the -- I don't think that the right to vote is as fundamental for example as the privilege of not being barred from getting in trial, which was certainly involved in 1866 because you had Negroes who were forbidden to engage in certain occupations and some of the black coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="7385.185" offset="29646200">Or to have a home, same thing as it was fit in, in some of the black coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="7390.555" offset="29667621">Or for example the Black Code laws which made the criminal offense punished by -- I thinking in Virginia five years in penitentiary teaching Negroes to read and write.</text>
            <text syncTime="7399.758" offset="29704401">To prevent again -- enforcement, prevent slavery votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7404.494" offset="29723418">And I might say personally that for example I voted -- I take personally that all of the candidates I voted for in the last general action lost, I don't feel personally affected at all although of course, I'm over 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="7421.310" offset="29790710">I also say as far as this particular statute is concerned that I don't see the slightest degree of difference in principle between Congress saying that Puerto Ricans educating Spanish in Puerto Rico may vote in New York and the Puerto Ricans who are taught to drive in the left-hand side of the road, Puerto Rico may drive in New York on the left-hand side of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="7446.796" offset="29892587">I think they're exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="7448.680" offset="29900110">True there's an argument about inconvenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="7451.141" offset="29909932">I think there's an argument about inconvenience that goes both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="7454.684" offset="29924143">It's inconvenient to print materials in Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="7457.313" offset="29934696">It's also inconvenient to dodge opposing traffic that I would say of the person who'd lived in Manhattan, and I think, and in New York, it was resourceful enough to find a parking space in Manhattan as resourceful enough to be able to dodge in opposing traffic.</text>

            <text syncTime="7520.109" offset="30185890">Now, I might say that in my estimation if this Court has the power to set standards of reasonableness, it means that in fact didn't affect this Court with this setting voting qualifications, likewise if Congress had the power to set reasonableness, it just shifts the power from one to the other, for the reason that in my view, one man reasonableness is another man's (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="7546.668" offset="30292052">I think if we pull every person in this room as to what would be reasonable voting qualifications and I find some very diverse ideas on the subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="7701.409" offset="30911049">And that is the discrimination which involved in this statute between American citizens who are born in New York and educated in a foreign language outside of New York and American citizens who are born in/or at point American citizens born in Puerto Rico or educated in Spanish in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="7727.821" offset="31016688">Now, to me it seems that the federal statute itself is irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="7733.225" offset="31038318">That is to say if we are getting into a rational distinction but I'm not getting into a discretion where the New York distinction is rational but I think the federal distinction is irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="7741.718" offset="31072277">That is to say the point that I'm making is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7745.978" offset="31089309">It is entirely possible under the Fourteenth Amendment which makes all persons born to be United States citizens, the moment of birth for a citizen of the United States abate to be taken to a non-American flag school educated with foreign language.</text>
            <text syncTime="7763.939" offset="31161198">It's not only you can see but I'm sure it happens in a number of cases and in fact I may say that I have a second cousin whose child is in fact being educated in Chile, the only American citizen born in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7775.626" offset="31207905">So therefore, it only can happen but has happened at least in one instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7779.505" offset="31223474">Now supposing that person comes back, educating Chile, able to read and write Spanish just as well as any Puerto Rican in the United States is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7788.042" offset="31257537">Comes back to New York, offers to vote, can read the Spanish newspapers just as well as any New York any person educated in Puerto Rico can read the Spanish language in his papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7799.139" offset="31301945">What happens, sorry, time has made a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7803.926" offset="31321172">Is this a distinction that has any rational basis to it at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="7808.254" offset="31338412">They're both American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="7810.546" offset="31347608">They're both now citizens of New York because under the Fourteenth Amendment, all persons or all -- all American citizens are citizens of the State in which they reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="7821.889" offset="31392956">Therefore my point is, that being citizens of the State which they reside they are now New Yorkers and there is absolutely no rational distinction to say a New Yorker educated in Puerto Rico shall be entitled to vote and a New Yorker educated in Chile shall not, though I know --</text>

            <text syncTime="8778.211" offset="35218223">Or equal protection, yes that is my contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="8780.955" offset="35229194">I might say that of course due process applies to all persons which is another good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="8787.812" offset="35256675">Bingham the said against letting aliens vote and nothing that he did say, in fact, in the admission of Oregon, one of those two reasons for voting against the admission of Oregon, he made a long speech on the subject where he said, this is a recent new innovation which he was dead set against was contrary to the Constitution and aliens were permitted to vote in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="8807.482" offset="35335356">He said it's a recent innovation which maintained Illinois and one or two of the Western States to induce him against the commerce to permit aliens to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="8815.309" offset="35366703">He said he was dead set against it and therefore it's inconceivable that he attended to permit aliens to vote, contrary to his own long well-settled convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="8827.586" offset="35415813">And therefore since the Due Process Clause protects aliens as well as citizens, it -- to me it's inconceivable that the Due Process Clause would protect the right to vote for the reason that otherwise the aliens would be entitled a right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="8841.687" offset="35472133">Because of course, as far as protection of life, liberty, and property, you couldn't take that without due process from aliens anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="8848.582" offset="35499719">I think every alien would be entitled if he came to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="8852.348" offset="35514765">He would be entitled to not have life, liberty, or property taking to confront him without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="8858.472" offset="35539320">So you see that the Fourteenth Amendment in fact it brought back to its historical understanding and fits very neatly.</text>
            <text syncTime="8865.190" offset="35566174">That is it -- it's -- makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="8870.190" offset="35586132">You don't need to try and figure out some of these odd -- oddities.</text>
            <text syncTime="8874.699" offset="35604208">What would have you?</text>
            <text syncTime="8875.763" offset="35608492">Give everybody the protection as a person 99 years old entitled to go to a first grade school, so that you'd got to have reasonable classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="8884.663" offset="35644123">You have to have all sorts of qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="8887.173" offset="35654154">But if you go back to the original understanding, I think you do not need to have any qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="8896.210" offset="35690308">Now, I know you -- I think I have a bit more time and I just want to say a word since Your Honor originally asked me and I thought -- I thought having this obvious but as I have a few minutes say one or two words, just about the question of treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="8911.526" offset="35751539">I do not consider that Congress' power under the Treaty Clause and I think this is well settled, to add to any substantive power Congress has in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="8924.045" offset="35801590">Now, I think I have set forth as earliest decisions in Mr. Chief Justice Marshall that -- and I think perhaps it's worth reading the little snibb -- squib from Carter and Grant that the -- I'm sorry, Pollard and Hagan in 3 Howard.</text>
            <text syncTime="8947.589" offset="35895735">Now, the king of Spain -- it can't be admitted to the king of Spain could by treaty or otherwise impart of the United States any of his royal prerogatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="8955.092" offset="35925828">Much less cannot be admitted they have the capacity to receive the power to exercise them.</text>
            <text syncTime="8959.068" offset="35941710">Every nation acquiring territory by treaty or otherwise withholds its subject to the constitution and laws of its own government and not according to those that the government's ceding.</text>
            <text syncTime="8967.513" offset="35975461">Therefore, the Treaty with Spain Treaty of Paris gives the United States no power over the territories and wouldn't have otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="8976.121" offset="36009942">My contention is it would have the same power by statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="8979.711" offset="36024257">And therefore, I say, that the statute gains no additional efficacy by the United Nations Charter or by world rule of law conventions or by treaties or by statements by the UN Secretary General or resolutions or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="8998.364" offset="36098863">It's either constitutional within Congress' power or it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="9001.728" offset="36112342">And it seems to me that the issue is clear cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="9005.327" offset="36126762">The statute invades or reserve power of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9009.694" offset="36144212">Thank you Your Honor, that's all I have to say.</text>

            <label>Ms. Jean M. Coon</label>
            <text syncTime="9017.082" offset="36173782">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9019.600" offset="36183813">Because of the scheduled argument of Cardona against Power immediately following the argument of this appeal, the presentation of our argument hereby the amicus curiae in this case is in somewhat reversed order from the argument as presented in our brief because issues which are similar to the issues in Cardona if not reached in this argument can be handled by the counsel for the appellees in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9049.474" offset="36303350">I think it would be somewhat significant at this point to discuss a few statistics with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9060.174" offset="36346086">The record in this case contains affidavits by various people estimating the numbers of Puerto Ricans in New York State or in the City of New York who are affected by 4 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="9075.263" offset="36406481">But these affidavits are no more than estimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="9078.629" offset="36419960">The record in this case contains only one factual basis for these figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="9084.919" offset="36445142">And that is the 1960 Census Report, the last authoritative counting of Puerto Ricans in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="9096.178" offset="36490177">That census report showed that in 1960 there were 642,600 and some Puerto Ricans in the entire State of New York of whom 194,000 were mainland born and may be presumed literate in English if adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="9116.971" offset="36573351">In the City of New York in 1960, there were 612,000 Puerto Ricans, 182,000 of whom were mainland born.</text>
            <text syncTime="9130.352" offset="36626850">The percentages which the census figures developed for the State, as a whole, showed that approximately 50% of the total Puerto Rican population in New York State were of voting age.</text>
            <text syncTime="9146.358" offset="36690902">And that approximately 60% of the Puerto Ricans of that age group had attained an education either in Spanish or English of seventh grade or higher, but at least seventh grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="9164.773" offset="36764463">Thus, if we take these figures for the State as a whole and apply them to what we know as to the total population of the City of New York, we would find that in 1960, there were approximately 300,000 Puerto Ricans of voting age in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="9184.166" offset="36842099">And adopting this 60% figure which the census figures apply to the State as a whole in the attainment of a seventh grade education, we would find that in 1960, it could be estimated that had 4 (e) then been enacted and could Puerto Ricans vote by proof of literacy either in English or Spanish, that approximately 200,000 Puerto Ricans would have been eligible to vote in New York City at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="9215.049" offset="36965606">Now, how many Puerto Ricans actually were registered in the City of New York in 1960?</text>
            <text syncTime="9222.954" offset="36997266">In 19 -- approximately 1960, the City of New York, the migration division of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, various civic organizations put on a massive campaign to specially register the Puerto Rican population of the City of New York in compliance with New York State English literacy requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="9249.655" offset="37104055">In November 2nd of 1960, the New York Times reported that this effort have resulted in the registration of 230,000 Puerto Rican and Hispanic residents of the City of New York complying with the English literacy requirements of New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="9272.827" offset="37196737">In 1961, New York mayoralty election, it was reported that 200,000 Puerto Ricans registered and voted for mayor in the city of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="9286.186" offset="37250132">And the conclusion which can be drawn from this that the majority of Puerto Rican residents of the City of New York can comply with New York's English literacy requirement is reinforced by the fact that last November with New York City complying with Section 4 (e), only 8,107 Puerto Ricans registered in the City of New York and that this figure would include new immigrants to the city who might equally be able to comply with New York's English literacy requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="9323.799" offset="37400597">These studies which were conducted in the middle of 1950's by the New York City Board of Education demonstrated that students coming into the New York City public school system directly from Puerto Rico and the early elementary grade did have a reading knowledge of the English language in addition to a speaking knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="9347.123" offset="37493906">That while English is no longer the major language of instruction in the school within Puerto Rico, English is taught as an additional language from the first grade on in the schools in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="9359.447" offset="37543225">Puerto Ricans do not come to the mainland totally devoid of any knowledge of English either spoken or written.</text>
            <text syncTime="9368.472" offset="37579274">Now, let us look to the genesis of the two statutes which are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="9376.069" offset="37609681">New York's English literacy requirement was put into its laws at a time when there were only 7000 Puerto Ricans in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="9386.345" offset="37650850">It was not put into law to prevent Puerto Ricans from participating in the elective franchise in New York significantly at the time this became part of New York's law English was the major language of instruction in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="9400.848" offset="37708842">And it could have had no bearing upon Puerto Ricans.</text>
            <text syncTime="9404.638" offset="37723993">It was put into the law as a part of New York's solution to what had become as a result of information discovered in World War I of the horrible situation of draftees who could not take oral orders in English of the hundredths of thousandths of persons of draft age in the United States who were not literate in any language.</text>
            <text syncTime="9430.857" offset="37828796">It was put into a -- the law in answer to the problem which had arisen of industrial safety because the many immigrants who could -- who had joined the labor force in the State were not able to understand safety regulations in English, and was put into the law as part of a package which involved also the intensified adult education programs in English.</text>
            <text syncTime="9460.393" offset="37946974">It was proposed at that time that adult education programs be provided in the places of employment of these immigrants so that the English language and the advantages to them which would come from learning this would be brought to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="9475.967" offset="38009250">They would not be asked to go to the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="9479.588" offset="38023774">There was additional training proposed and put into the law for adult or for non-adult, children who had pass beyond the maximum requirements for remaining in school, the groups between 16 and 21 for additional after working hour instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="9499.110" offset="38101828">So that New York statute was not put into our laws as a part and parcel of any discriminatory program.</text>
            <text syncTime="9509.005" offset="38141430">It was put into our laws in order to promote industrial safety promote education, promote intelligent participation in the Government of the State, and to encourage the learning of English on immigration population which come into New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="9525.416" offset="38207049">Significantly at this point even in 1960, 47% of the population of the City of New York was either foreign born or the children of foreign born persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="9537.669" offset="38256055">New York State still has a very large immigrant or first generation American population.</text>

            <text syncTime="10114.900" offset="40565070">That therefore, we must remember that 4 (e) does not legislate as to the territory of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="10123.131" offset="40597985">It confers no rights upon residents of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="10127.495" offset="40615434">It confers no governmental powers upon the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</text>

            <text syncTime="10203.321" offset="40918664">And we must remember that 96% of the Puerto Ricans come into New York State are white, that the problem is greater than voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="10213.405" offset="40958997">The problem is a question of their language handicap which they have in competing economically on the mainland.</text>
            <text syncTime="10223.359" offset="40998808">Because in elementary education or even a high school education in Spanish, in Puerto Rico opens few doors in the mainland economy that we believe that New York statute would be reasonable even if we take it only as to Puerto Ricans.</text>

            <text syncTime="10876.346" offset="43610843">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10880.842" offset="43628816">I feel obliged to point as I did in the beginning that we are not trying to have the New York literacy test declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="10896.163" offset="43690047">They still will keep their literacy test and 4 (e) allows for the exact same test, the only difference is the language points.</text>
            <text syncTime="10908.677" offset="43740097">And secondly, on the question of the Fourteenth Amendment and what Congress was thinking about, in our brief on pages 14 and 15, we point out the sponsors in the bill Senators Kennedy and Javits and in the House of Representatives Ryan and Gilbert, in which they set forth the same thing we're talking about in our brief about the fact that Congress itself sustained the education in Spanish, sustained it over a period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="10952.324" offset="43914700">He gave them citizenship and then brought them over to the mainland and urged them on.</text>
            <text syncTime="10959.551" offset="43943643">So Congress did consider the treaty point as well as the Fourteenth Amendment point.</text>
            <text syncTime="10967.376" offset="43974886">Secondly, this is not the only provision of the Voting Rights Bill on the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10975.031" offset="44005501">The provision as to the poll tax if you remember was also on the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10981.879" offset="44032982">On the question of the abandonment of English in the schools of Puerto Rico was the Commissioner appointed by our Government that originally decided that it couldn't be done any longer and so it was actually our Government that took responsibility for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="11006.158" offset="44130053">I think that the one point that's significant in the opposition here today is that they make no basis of justification for the requirement that the literacy test be held in English.</text>
            <text syncTime="11027.763" offset="44216466">I've heard no argument or whatsoever about it except the State of New York which says that this will be a stimulus to get the Puerto Ricans to learn English.</text>
            <text syncTime="11041.383" offset="44270905">That's a very interesting proposition because it would appear to me that getting the right to vote and being able to participate in the municipal elections might bring about a little more employment and a little more schooling and the few other items -- I completely lost on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="11065.378" offset="44366932">Finally, to make our position clear, it is our position that under the Fourteenth Amendment and despite what has been said here that the only rights we have under the Fourteenth Amendment are the civil rights that were recognized in 1866 is almost unbelievable argument to be made today.</text>
            <text syncTime="11097.566" offset="44495663">And I was also most interested since some have been doing delving in these debates that the Equal Protection Clause was for the purpose of protecting Chinese people in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="11117.831" offset="44576747">And I don't believe I remember a single one of the cases that interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment from Slaughterhouse through Plessy against Ferguson that had anything to say about the Chinese in San Francisco to the contrary this Court says over and over again what the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause was for was to protect the newly freed slaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="11151.199" offset="44710181">We say that Congress with its power recognized under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, then drew upon its knowledge of what it had happened as a result of the action of Congress in regard to Puerto Rico and realized that there were over 700,000 American citizens in New York in its vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="11185.383" offset="44846958">And a large proportion of them unable to speak English but literate otherwise were being denied the right to vote and with the least friction against the State fashioned the provision that would not in any way injure the State of New York or its right to require that its voters be literate and to pass 4 (e) and it to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="11219.885" offset="44984989">I believe that the question of the right of Congress to legislate in this area has been so often passed upon by this Court that we do not have to worry about that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="11234.442" offset="45043190">And secondly, that what they did was reasonable, was required and therefore that the judgment of the court below should be reversed --</text>
