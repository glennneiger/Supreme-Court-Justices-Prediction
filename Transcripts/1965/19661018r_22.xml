            <text syncTime="29.281" offset="195027">I think your questions are directed to that and our simple position is that New York has not created a cause of action for intentional falsehood and that the omission of intent and falsity is fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.099" offset="266393">And we start with a standard that non-defamatory language about a public fact which we have here is protected by the Constitution unless there is both falsity and knowledge of falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.170" offset="334625">Let me turn to the New York cases attempting to discuss them in the order that the Court's questions were put to us, first, in the question of truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.635" offset="408499">And I turn to the case of Mrs. Blumenthal and this case went to our Court of Appeals and Mrs. Blumenthal in the early 1930s was selling bread on Orchard Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.403" offset="455520">She was pictured in a travel log for approximately six seconds out of a 17-minute travel log.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.362" offset="595431">It is further shown that no time displaying this picture appear alone but on the contrary, the pictures of other individuals appear on the side, in front or in back of her.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.496" offset="715908">It is further shown that at no time in the picture is plaintiff depicted in a foolish, unnatural or undignified manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.659" offset="944532">Now, if any further -- in anything further on that, you can turn to the comment by the Court of Appeals in 1952 in the Gautier case concerning Mrs. Blumenthal and her selling bread in -- bread on Orchard Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.681" offset="1008689">And there, the Court said, “The Blumenthal case supra illustrates the area of privacy which may not be invaded even in this modern era of television, when travelling upon the public highway may expect to be televised but only as an incidental part of the general scene, so when attending a public event, such as a professional football game, they expect to be televised in the status in which he attends.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.736" offset="1116940">If a mere spectator, he may be taken as part of the general audience but may not be picked out of the crowd alone, thrust upon the screen and unduly featured for public view.”</text>
            <text syncTime="273.031" offset="1170021">Now, let me illustrate what I think that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.580" offset="1184231">It's the New York Times, a couple of Sundays ago, this one picture here of a race riot in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.766" offset="1217041">There's another picture down here of a soldier in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.839" offset="1229267">Those two pictures are as, to use the language of Gautier, may not be picked out of a crowd alone, thrust upon the screen and unduly featured for a public view.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.169" offset="1282661">So strictly under the language, covering Mrs. Blumenthal's case, as going again in the Gautier case in 1952, these two pictures are subject to the same injunction which issued in the Blumenthal case and the person publishing them is -- is subject to a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.260" offset="3898981">There, the majority found there was fictionalization but the dissenting opinion by then presiding Justice Peck and Mr. Justice Shientag said, “Well, on the facts before us, the article is basically true even though there is embellishment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="971.313" offset="3963242">So that I that suggest to you that with the fictionalization cases by themselves, it is not a test of truth or falsity.</text>

            <text syncTime="999.871" offset="4077449">If there is any basis for the suggestion of danger enforced in a part of the statute or consideration, it is the duty of the legislature to repeal such part thereof or so modify it as to define with a greater particularity what it intends should be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.194" offset="4138680">But the statute was never amended despite that suggestion by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.589" offset="4156339">I may say in that regard that just as this Court in the New York Time case used Coleman against MacLennan in the Supreme Court of Kansas as a guide to the common law that I would suggest that a similar use maybe made of Donahue against Warner Brothers in the Supreme Court of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.323" offset="4247245">That case construed a New -- a Utah statute practically identical with the New York statute here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.850" offset="4365319">So, I suggest that that Donahue case, which is cited in our brief, can be used as the model much as you did with the Supreme Court of Kansas in the New York Times.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.931" offset="4621632">Now, on the question of standing on this matter of truth, I say that we have standing for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.286" offset="4659040">First, we have, up to the time we got to this Court throughout all the New York courts stated that the Life article was true, in the broader sense of the word “truth”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.547" offset="4708150">Surely that there was the ambiguous inaccuracy on the word “enactment -- reenactment”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.954" offset="4733750">But aside from that, the fact that the play was the heart and soul of the Hill incident as testified to at the trial and the fact that it basically -- merely was a -- a picture of a family being terrorized by three convicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.945" offset="4801773">We made the point throughout that the article was basically true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.150" offset="4818596">I think myself that is the reason why the Court of Appeals affirmed on both opinions below including the opinion by Mr. Justice Raiben which said that even if -- if it's true, you still going to be libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.241" offset="4870945">It was an answer to that contention of ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.872" offset="4885469">So that I say that on that broader test of truth having put that forward throughout the courts below, we have standing to raise this question of -- of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.103" offset="4934370">I may say that on this broader question of truth, this question of standard to illustrate, people say that the British and the American libel law are the same and that each has a defense of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.539" offset="4984107">That's true when you ask completely false in a way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.566" offset="4996228">I -- if I should write that Johnny Jones stole a watch last Tuesday and I come in the Court and prove that Johnny Jones stole a clock last Tuesday, that's a defense under our law, it is not a defense under British law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.857" offset="5053384">Or if I find that Johnny Jones -- truth of Johnny Jones stole a watch last Wednesday instead of Tuesday, it is not a defense under British law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.737" offset="5088911">And you can refer to Gatley Section 257 in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.069" offset="5106256">So, it depends whether you're using the narrower test of truth or a broader test of truth in applying these standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.485" offset="5139902">In any event, we did raise that and it seems to me, it does give us standing to raise the point of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.515" offset="5164039">Secondly, under Button and Dombrowski, in this Court, when you have a statute which has been applied to enjoin, as in Mrs. Blumenthal, a truthful account and in other cases which we cited in our -- in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.577" offset="5232271">When you have this statute, it does have an inhibitory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.807" offset="5253169">And I say that at that point, this Court should raise the point and go into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.560" offset="5272186">I ensure that ever since the Youssoupoff case, which is cited in our brief and which I will go into in a minute, the C.B.S. has been more than careful in trying to hold back in some other things it has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.758" offset="5317012">It's impossible to affect to -- really to appraise the effect of the decisions but we do know that they do take place and the smaller publishers just can't afford to be coming up to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.110" offset="5978432">This is a fictionalized version.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.250" offset="5990971">And then the editor for reasons known to himself about any inquiry whatever, strikes that sentence and publishes the article as it is, so that the article is no longer represented to be fictionalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.604" offset="6064323">Now, is that negligence, wilful negligence or an intentional misrepresentation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.364" offset="6235373">And that brings me to the question of intent, first, on the cases other than our case and secondly to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.220" offset="6270795">I think it is clear beyond the -- from a venture of a doubt that this question of intent or knowledge of falsity or even malice or certainly knowledge of falsity is utterly falling to this question of privacy as interpreted by the New York courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.065" offset="6342161">And the clearest example I can give you is the Thompson against Close-Up case, which we've cited in our brief, where a magazine used a wrong picture and a summary disposition of the case was denied because, said the Court, “It may be found that the publication although, perhaps, by mistake, was -- was published in order to increase circulation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.536" offset="6432127">So that, the intent end of it was totally thrown out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.935" offset="6453652">The Youssoupoff decisions and case where the admitted assassin of Rasputin coming into Court and saying, “You didn't tell it correctly.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.291" offset="6491059">Intent was following to that case throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.696" offset="6508718">It reached the point initially whether it's a motion for summary judgment by the plaintiff which was almost granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.956" offset="6533796">Two concurring judges in our Appellant Division said, “He should've gotten it because there was embellishment,” but no discussion of intent whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.802" offset="6569113">It went back to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.683" offset="6576636">And we found in the Supreme Court of New York County trying as to whether the admitted assassin of Rasputin and to have his -- have the story correctly told and the matter was put to a jury are the test of charge for the juries, in appendix to my brief, no question of intent raised throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.587" offset="6652287">And the only question given to the jury was truth or falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.378" offset="6667438">On the motion to dismiss, the judge -- trial judge specifically said, "Malice is not a part of this."</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.928" offset="6693665">So that I say it clearly appears from the Youssoupoff case and those decisions that intent is -- is not a necessary element, no scienter under this New York statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.205" offset="6742775">The most recent decision of that is the Spahn case by our Appellate Division in 1965 and at the end of that, it said, "If the publication, however, by intention per report or so format, is neither factual nor historical, the statute applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.243" offset="6818948">And if the subject is 11 person, his written consent must be obtained.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.031" offset="6838070">So that it's clear from other cases that intent is not a portion of this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.049" offset="6862102">And this is a crime were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.669" offset="6872656">Now, let's see what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.528" offset="6884045">I got my first indication of what was going to happen when I made a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.848" offset="6905361">They -- specifically on the ground that intent had not been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.902" offset="6925528">And the trial judge denied that and said, "I think we better put up to the jury whether the article is true or false."</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.761" offset="6956979">Then we got the summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.223" offset="6966801">And my second point of summation dealt with intent and that they should prove that we knew what we were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.895" offset="6997521">And immediately, counsel for appellee got up and interrupted my summation and said, "This is quite erroneous," and trial judge said, “Well, I will instruct on that."</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.615" offset="7044437">Then we got to the charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.824" offset="8117234">They were confused about this work trade and they said, “We like to know some more about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.109" offset="8134370">And at that time, I think Mr. Garment, representing the appellee, made two significant statements which pointed out his position and the Court followed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.848" offset="8169374">First, he said, “Our claim is that the total article must be read and the jury must determine whether it conveyed the basically false impression as to the relationship of the Hill family to The Desperate Hours, that's page 306 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.763" offset="8229038">And then the Court said, “Well, we're going to charge that, the thing is covered," and then -- then Mr. Garment said, "Your Honor, if they are telling news, if they are telling news, purporting to tell news but have as the basis for the use of the individual's name something that is furious or essentially false, that we contend," and I think the law is clear, “it is for trade purposes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.668" offset="8324646">So, it is purely a falsity test, and it's the same falsity test which was applied in Youssoupoff and indeed, it is the falsity test which is called for under the prior appellate decisions in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.886" offset="8381489">So, all I'm really saying is that -- that the question of intent never entered this case and doesn't enter in New York law so far as this question of privacy is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.929" offset="8433629">And that's a fatal omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.920" offset="8441675">Now, when we got to the Appellate Division in this case, again, on intent, we -- we had Mr. Justice Stevens saying, "The defendant merely concluded that basically, the play was a reenactment and so stated."</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.505" offset="8507921">Again, there's no question of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.266" offset="8518997">It's a question -- we concluded that it was reenactment and so stated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.230" offset="9734840">In that case, there was a very violent split.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.226" offset="9746857">And presiding Justice Peck and Mr. Justice Shientag said, “Well, these facts as we have them are basically true even though if they have been blown up."</text>

            <text syncTime="3126.688" offset="12584695">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.895" offset="12605489">We've come far afield from the first time that we argued this case this spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.625" offset="12632447">Then the question before the Court was whether or not the judgment in this case impinged on the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.340" offset="12679258">Now, we have the problem of whether or not the judgment in all of the New York cases going back over 63 years may have impinged upon the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.742" offset="12744878">I am not going to make a point of arguing the standing question because I believe that not only this judgment but the interpretations of the Court of New York of this statute over 63 years can be sustained as on First Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.597" offset="12848323">But to bring the whole matter into context, I think it is vitally important to see first and to come back to the case that this Court must decide in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.700" offset="12916764">Now, counsel for the appellant has stated here as he stated previously that this account was basically true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.356" offset="12963366">His backup position to that is that if there was falsehood, it was at most negligent falsehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.916" offset="12997639">He also contends that as far as the law is concerned as applied in this case, that law did not require proof of intentional falsehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.006" offset="13069946">It is our contention that in this case, it was argued by the plaintiff, it was established by the evidence, it was charged by the Court, it was found by the jury and it was held by the courts of New York in their Appeals Courts that Life Magazine lied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.816" offset="13173182">And that Life Magazine knew that it lied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.757" offset="13188960">That is the proposition that I contend for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.946" offset="13205782">Now, let us look at the facts in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.417" offset="13251654">In the case of this -- presented before the Court, Life Magazine by what I would call the device of a -- of a verbal picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.238" offset="13358860">Life Magazine presented to its millions of readers the proposition that the Hill incident was the same as The Desperate Hours play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.108" offset="13418419">Now, that was not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.806" offset="13433152">We argued that proposition previously in the spring but the best and most eloquent proof that it was not true is that Life tells its pictures not only by its words but primarily by its pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.707" offset="13508803">And in telling its story by pictures, the six pictures that it selects on this play presents incidents none of which occurred to the Hills, all of which, of course, had happened in the play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.320" offset="13579229">This was not simply incidental falsity, it was substantial falsity and it was complete falsity on every one of those incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.449" offset="13615696">Now, the contention is made by the appellant that the only error involved here was the use of the word “reenacted”, and that that was at best negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.746" offset="13668881">But appellant had to use the word “reenacted” by reason of what it had done in terms of the presentation of the photographic story because if it had said what was the truth that the Hill incident was one of several hostage instances about which the author had read, and that it was reminiscent of this incident, this would not have been editorially in keeping with the picture story which Life presented to its readers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.660" offset="13844633">The second proposition is that not only did Life make this false statement, but that its editors and in this case, its picture editor, made the statement with knowledge that it was false, what information did he have before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.745" offset="13920911">And here, Mr. Justice Brennan, I would like to distinguish the information that was available to Life Magazine from the information that was available to the New York Times in the case of New York Times versus Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.499" offset="13983918">In that case, there was information in the Times' general files, as you pointed out in your opinion, which proved the falsity of some of the materials in the ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.188" offset="14026654">In that case, the New York Times was printing a -- an ad which had been submitted to them by others rather than printing what was in effect a statement that had been authored by the New York Times staff itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.013" offset="14101991">In this case, we have a story that was originated by the defendant, and we have the truth about this story, not in the general files of the defendant, but in the story files of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.841" offset="14169283">And in the story file of the defendant, there were not only the current statements and stories that have been carried at the time the Hill incident occurred but there was an article by the author himself in which he specifically stated that his play was not based on any specific incident but was based on many instances incur -- occurring in several different cities and that when he had completed his story, it was different from any of the hostage instances about which he had read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.969" offset="14337825">The defendant's editor Prideaux was questioned on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.191" offset="14354752">In his testimony, he agreed that he had that story in his possession and that he had read it and in its brief in the appellate court, the appellant indicated and conceded that the defendant -- witness Prideaux had read this story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.359" offset="14435418">And so we have first, falsity, second, knowledge of falsity and then third, how did the defendant, with knowledge of this falsity, proceed to use the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.025" offset="14502083">Let us now understand another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.017" offset="14513995">In the 63 years of the history of this statute, there has never been an instance of an application of a privacy finding, the finding of liability with regard to a current news story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.752" offset="14577002">In this entire 63-year period, these stories have always involved either magazines with lead times, like Life Magazine, or television or motion picture stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.508" offset="14659967">All of which involve creation and time for creation rather than the kind of misstatement that may occur, for example, as was mentioned in New York Times in the heat of debate or because of having to meet a deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.748" offset="14720989">Let's look at the Life Magazine story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.555" offset="14732169">That story had a lead time of three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.773" offset="14748992">During that three-month period, the appellant's editors had the opportunity to question the Hills as to whether the story was true, they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.255" offset="14794968">To ask the author as to whether the story was a reenactment, they did not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3697.077" offset="14866230">And the author in his testimony in this trial made it clear that that question had not been asked to him and that he had not told them that it was a reenactment of that story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.169" offset="14922654">They not only did not do that, but in the light of the testimony that they had and the evidence that they had in their own files, they nevertheless then proceeded to write a story and in each successive draft, they removed deliberately every qualifying phrase which would indicate that the Hill experience might be different from The Desperate Hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.449" offset="15063716">They struck out the words somewhat fictionalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.522" offset="15076045">They struck out the words that the house in which the pictures were made was the Hills' former home.</text>

            <text syncTime="3758.797" offset="15113139">They changed the running head of the article from the story of the play, The Desperate Hours to the story of the Hills True Crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.414" offset="15159637">All of these was done deliberately, all of this was done with knowledge from evidence that they had in their own files that this was not the story of the Hills and that The Desperate Hours, as the author himself had written, was based on several instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.872" offset="15233407">And when he had completed his story, it was different from any one of the hostage instances about what she had written.</text>

            <text syncTime="4564.786" offset="18337067">But let me -- let me give a case of -- involving a true state of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.438" offset="18367683">In the previous argument here, Mr. Justice Warren questioned me about the case of Melvin versus Reid under the California law which was waking up long forgotten misconduct somewhat akin to the old law of criminal libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.525" offset="18432049">And thus, Court of California found that there was liability in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.462" offset="18447827">I indicated in answer to the questions that I did not believe that the court of New York would find liability in the case of Melvin versus Reid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.959" offset="18485756">There is another case, a case in Missouri, 1942, Barber versus Time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.348" offset="18515327">The facts in that case were tried under a common law jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.850" offset="18545316">And in that case, what happened was that a woman, very attractive young woman had contracted a disease in which during the previous year, she had eaten enough to feed a family of 10 and yet had lost 25 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.577" offset="18616264">Time Magazine, in its medical section, ran a story on this woman, a story entitled ”Starving Glutton” and the -- either Barber, I think, was the heading on the picture, and it used the picture of a woman taken in the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.262" offset="18694945">Liability was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.652" offset="18704558">Punitive damages were not allowed because Time pled that it had used the picture, taken it from wire services and did not have knowledge of what was the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.015" offset="18753982">The fact was that reporters someway got into the hospital room, asked the woman if they could use the story, she said, “No,” she did not want it used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.010" offset="18797972">And then her picture was taken surreptitiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.407" offset="18811556">The Missouri Court held that there was liability and then pointed out that as far as this particular case was concerned, it did not believe that the use of her name and her picture was necessary for discussion of this medical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.483" offset="18895879">Now, I would suggest that a case of that type while I doubt it would meet the Raiben dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.649" offset="18928584">I would suggest that a case of that type would present a very difficult problem for the Supreme Court of the United States in holding that the doctor-patient relationship, the right of an individual not to have his physical disabilities published to the world that that does not involve a violation of privacy in which a privacy statute or common law holding could reach.</text>
