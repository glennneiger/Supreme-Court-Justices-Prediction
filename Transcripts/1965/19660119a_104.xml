            <label>Mr. Myron G. Ehrlich</label>
            <text syncTime="7.460" offset="133204">Yes sir, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.696" offset="146160">This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.240" offset="172283">I was assigned by the United States Court of Appeals to prefect the petitioner's appeal from the District Court to that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.897" offset="206973">Mr. Arens represented the petitioner in the Juvenile Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.781" offset="234454">I am here just as a public service representing an indigent without compensation and so is Mr. Arens who joined me in this petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.286" offset="280534">The facts in this case if the Court pleases are that on -- on or about September 5, 1961, the accused in this case was arrested by officers of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia and he at that time have been a ward of the Juvenile Court for some two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.158" offset="383979">It appears from the record that he was arrested because two years prior to that time, the police department had taken him without authority of the Juvenile Court to the police department and there had him fingerprinted at the time when he was 14 years of age and they discovered some fingerprints in the areas of these houses in which the accused allegedly broke in when he was 16 years old and they finally discovered that this 16-year-old boy was the boy whose his fingerprints were in the vicinity of two or three of these areas together with other fingerprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.500" offset="569344">After they arrested him in this case, they questioned him for some four or five days, as I read the record, and on the second day of his arrest, his mother retained or asked Mr. Arens to come into Court and to represent the indigent accused who was then 16 years old.</text>

            <label>Mr. Myron G. Ehrlich</label>
            <text syncTime="141.345" offset="668714">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.003" offset="671431">He apparently made a confession which is not used in evidence against him.</text>

            <label>Mr. Myron G. Ehrlich</label>
            <text syncTime="145.382" offset="684910">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.535" offset="689507">And on that confession, let me say that there was a search warrant issued and the discoveries is on to the search warrant would not be used in evidence against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.808" offset="734647">However, his fingerprints taken when he was 14 years old compared to his fingerprints taken when he was 16 years old at a time prior to the time of waiver of jurisdiction or probably the principal -- was the principal evidence against him upon which the conviction was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.724" offset="814268">And of course it is our contention that they taking of the fingerprints when he was 14 and the taking of the fingerprints of him when he was 16 was in violation of the law of the District of Columbia and those fingerprints were inadmissible in evidence, and for that reason, we believe that there's reversible error in this case for that reason alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.098" offset="887724">Nevertheless, if I may go on, about a day or so after the accused was being questioned by the police almost continually.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.228" offset="936312">Mr. Arens filed the first of his number of motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.074" offset="951672">And the first motion asked the Juvenile Court to not to turn the accused or do something about the accused being in the hands of the police not to commit them to continually interrogate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.406" offset="1016978">Then in this -- that motion was never heard, never answered and Mr. Arens filed another motion in the case and this was quite lengthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.850" offset="1054804">The second motion in this case, will the Juvenile Court to transfer immediately to the District of Columbia General Hospital Psychiatric Division for appropriate psychiatric observation to disclose his Social Service record to counsel and to hold a hearing immediately after the termination of the period of hospitalization if waiver of jurisdiction of this case was conflict as the condition preceding to any valid label.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.382" offset="1160861">Now the Court must remember that the -- this Juvenile Court here, as well as all -- every Juvenile Court of United States that I know and I think about, has the authority to waive jurisdiction under certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.758" offset="1206418">Now, they also by act of Congress have the authority to provide Social Service records that I referred to for inspection under certain conditions and the conditions set forth in the statute states that such records or parts thereof shall be made available by rule of court or special order of court to such persons governmental and private agencies and institutions has -- had a legitimate interest in the protection, welfare, treatment and rehabilitation of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.930" offset="1323133">Nevertheless, neither one of Mr. Arens' motions were ever answered nor was he -- were they ever heard but about seven days after they arrested the accused he was -- jurisdiction was waived to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>

            <label>Mr. Myron G. Ehrlich</label>
            <text syncTime="334.160" offset="1440057">Mr. Arens apparently immediately appealed to what it -- then was the Municipal Court of Appeals for failure of the Juvenile Court to do these things as contained in his motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.960" offset="1491257">And he also sued out a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.690" offset="1518111">The habeas corpus was issued, a hearing was held upon it and relief was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.497" offset="1541308">The writ was discharged and Mr. Arens immediately appealed that writ of habeas corpus -- I mean to deny -- the discharge of it to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and while that was standing also the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia ruled against Mr. Arens' contention and he filed leave for -- motion for leave to appeal to the United States District Court this affirmance by the municipal court of what the Juvenile Court had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.974" offset="1683310">Now, both of those appeals were heard together in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and they decided, one, that habeas corpus would not lie and they indicated that habeas corpus was unnecessary because they said that the petitioner could file a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he alleged in this habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.511" offset="1805458">And on the appeal from the ruling of the Juvenile Court that came up to the Municipal Court of Appeals the United States Court of Appeals decided that that was not an appealable order and therefore they would not consider it any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.002" offset="1875362">However, prior to the time that United States Court of Appeals decided that this could be done by a motion to dismiss the indictment, Mr. Arens, an able lawyer, said that he has had already filed such a motion in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to dismiss on the ground he would not this -- there was not a full investigation in the Juvenile Court, as required by law, he was not permitted to see the Social Service records of this indigent 16-year-old boy who would then a ward of that Court for some two years and there was no way in the world that he could rebut any ground that the Court may have had for waiving jurisdiction and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.132" offset="2055920">Both of those motions were overruled without any hearing of any type to District Court judge sitting there overruled both of the motions and the motion of Mr. Arens contained an alternative that is that under the statute a District Court judge is permitted to consider the case as the Juvenile Court judge and Mr. Arens asked in his motion that the indictment either be dismissed or in the alternative that the District Court sit as a Juvenile Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.227" offset="2204296">Now, the District Court judge overruled that without a hearing with emphasis, and we say that the failure to give a hearing in itself is reversible error because how in the world could the District Court judge know whether or not he should sit at a Juvenile Court unless he hear some evidence in the case unless he hears some argument in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.991" offset="2295306">Now, we say that the failure to do it and I may use authority for it, Judge Wright about Court of Appeals from the District of Columbia in a concurring opinion in a case decided, October 15, 1964, have this to say, “the trial court denied the defense motion that defendant be tried as a juvenile without holding a hearing to determine the legal and factual basis for the most.”</text>
            <text syncTime="578.514" offset="2417455">It says, “I agree that the conviction should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.831" offset="2430725">I simply state my reasons,” and this is one of the reasons that Judge --</text>

            <text syncTime="596.163" offset="2487986">It was decided October 15, 1964 the number of it is 18487 in the United States Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.258" offset="2532394">Now, after the District Court judge denied without hearing both of the motion filed in this case, the case went on to trial and in the trial of the case, apparently the principal defects of the accused was insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.665" offset="2618075">Prior to that time, the accused had been sent to D.C. General Hospital for their report as to whether or not he was suffering from a mental disease at the time when he committed the act and two if he was -- was the act a product of that mental disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.348" offset="2708773">The D.C. General Hospital asked to have doctors, go to report to the clerk as they must do under the DC code that the accused was suffering from a mental diseases at the time he committed the offense and that the act was a product of that mental disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.912" offset="2778990">Apparently, the United States Government to its prosecution was not content without appraisal of that diagnosis by the D.C. General Hospital staff and they asked the Court to have the accused sent to St. Elizabeths Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.035" offset="2843564">St. Elizabeths Hospital sent a report some 90 days later to the District of Columbia Court, the District Court with the same report that the accused was suffering from a mental disease and that the act if committed by him, the act with which he was charged, that they were the products of that mental disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.735" offset="2942307">Nevertheless, the Government proceeded to try the accused who had been indicted on three cases of house breaking, three cases of robbery and two counts of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.487" offset="3001344">And as I have indicated, his principal defense was insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.042" offset="3023496">He was found not guilty of a two counts of rape on the ground that he was suffering from a mental disease at the time he committed the offenses and that the acts if committed by him were the products of that mental disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.764" offset="3086399">And under our statute, an accused, if found not guilty under those circumstances has to be sent to St. Elizabeths Hospital until such time as the doctor superintendent certifies and the court is satisfied that he'll be no longer dangerous to himself and to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.722" offset="3150242">However, that same jury convicted him of the six counts, three of house breaking and three of robbery and the accused was sentenced to 90 years from the penitentiary, 15 years on each count, the maximum provided by law and 90 years in the District of Columbia is the equivalent of two life sentence, now, which means that he was sentenced to 90 years even though under the verdict of the jury on the rape charges, he is confined as a mental deficient in St. Elizabeths Hospital because the jury had decided that the acts were the products of a mental disease from which he was suffering at the time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Myron G. Ehrlich</label>
            <text syncTime="871.266" offset="3588472">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.116" offset="3591816">The issue of fact was only on the question of insanity sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.220" offset="3608221">Now, after St. Elizabeths Hospital sent to the Court, I mean they've said -- said that the accused was suffering from a mental disease at the time he committed these acts -- if the acts if committed by him are the products of this mental disease, the Government was not content and put the accused on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.039" offset="3691499">Now, all of the doctors from St. Elizabeths Hospital and all of the doctors I think there were some dozen or more from DC General testified that the accused was suffering from a mental disease and the acts if committed by him were the products of those diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.018" offset="3759417">However, one doctor who had agreed with the original report testified that the accused was then of unsound mind, that the accused was suffering from a mental disease at the time these alleged acts were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.881" offset="3834859">However, if he -- if the facts indicated that the accused went in to these premises originally for the purpose of committing robbery and not committing rape then he could not say that the acts were the product or the -- of the mental disease but if the accused went into these premises for the purpose of committing rape first and then incidentally rob, then he could say that his acts were the product of that disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.564" offset="3969651">And one doctor testified to that and he was one of the dozen or more doctors who had previously certified the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.705" offset="4002147">That was the only issue of fact involved apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.773" offset="4022418">Now, unfortunately, the counsel, not Mr. Arens, who represented the accused at the trial, failed to raise any of these points and I must honestly say to the Court that all of the points that I have, have to be considered as plain error affecting the substantial right of this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.276" offset="4112488">Otherwise, we have no standing in Court at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.368" offset="4132864">Now, when this case went to the jury, the District Court judge gave what in his charge in chief what he indicated to be his so-called “Allen” charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.895" offset="4222934">Now, from a reading of this, we say that it is coercive charge and it was a violation of the accused rights and that in and of itself, in our opinion and it is our contention that it is and constitutes reversible error because we say it is coercive, that it was given for the purpose of inducing a settlement, that indeed a settlement was made by the jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.164" offset="4335992">They certainly settled it when they found the accused not guilty of two capital counts charging rape on the ground of insanity and found him guilty, therefore, not of unsound mind of six counts, three of house breaking and three of robbery at all of the offenses committed at the same time or at least one rape, alleged rape and robbery and house breaking was committed at one time and another alleged rape, had robbery and house breaking was committed at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.409" offset="4472978">So the accused in our opinion was injured by what we say is a coercive and improper charge by the District Court judge when he gave the so-called “Allen” charge in his charging chief to the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.722" offset="4734307">Now, finally I will say to the Court without going into minute details that we based our contentions in this case for a reversal on the fact that the Juvenile Court failed to accord the accused effective assistance of counsel, that they failed to permit him to look at the Social Service records so he could give him effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.302" offset="4848619">That they gave him no hearing on this waiver, we say that that is the violation of the rights of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.091" offset="4879757">They gave him no hospitalization, we say that is a violation of the statute on psychiatric examinations for the purpose of attempting to discover whether or not they would waive or not waive jurisdiction over him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.632" offset="4929912">They gave him no full investigation.</text>
