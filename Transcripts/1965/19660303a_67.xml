            <text syncTime="14.385" offset="160893">At the outset I would like to make a comment about rather trivial, but recent development.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.792" offset="194539">Last night when I returned to my office about 4 o'clock, I found a bare copy of a letter from the Office of the Solicitor General unsigned which was addressed to the clerk of court saying, Dear Mr. Davis, the underlying decision of the Federal Trade Commission in this case which is officially reported at 55 F. T. C. 55 does not appear in the printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.947" offset="311150">For the convenience of the Court during oral argument, we had reproduced in a -- transmitting sufficient copies for its distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.065" offset="355662">The petitioner is not a party to that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.819" offset="374680">The petitioner is here because he was sentenced to imprisonment for a violation of a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.713" offset="418252">And the -- I've merely voice my objection because I think that it gives this document which can be based on different evidentiary rules from what we have in courts a prominence and the significance which it doesn’t deserve but I'm sure that the --</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph E. Casey</label>
            <text syncTime="108.614" offset="537788">This case arose out of a Federal Trade Commission cease and desist order against Holland Furnace Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.647" offset="597974">The date was August 5th, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.195" offset="620126">Holland Furnace Company was engaged in the business of selling furnaces, retailing them in what is known as the replacement of furnaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.112" offset="667773">Their salesmen made house to house calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.306" offset="680626">It was a company that was on the New York Stock Exchange at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.897" offset="702986">It did business in 44 different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.560" offset="725661">It had 500 branch offices and 5000 salesmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.309" offset="764635">And the -- at that time was doing a gross business of $30 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.451" offset="793161">The petitioner was president and chairman of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.523" offset="837465">The -- after the cease and desist order of August 5th, 1959, the Holland Furnace Company initiated proceedings before the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to review the Commission's cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.291" offset="916564">It was during those proceedings that the Federal Trade Commission through its attorney asked for a pendente lite order against Holland Furnace Company, which was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.245" offset="980302">That was issued August 5th, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.505" offset="1001409">The cease and desist order of the Commission was dated July 7th, 1958, but the pendente lite order, August 5th, 1959 is the one which the petitioner is charged with having violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.659" offset="1081971">Now, I make a point of the fact that the Commission's cease and desist order was against Holland Furnace Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.158" offset="1132022">The petitioner was not a party to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.600" offset="1149785">The cease and desist order of the Court of Appeals of August 5th, 1959 was against the Holland Furnace Company, not even reciting agents, representatives and so forth and the petitioner was not a party to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.480" offset="1245288">The pendente lite order against the Holland Furnace Company was made permanent on November 7th, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.405" offset="1332955">Now, the Holland Furnace Company on May 1962 had been taken over by a new management.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.119" offset="1391888">The new management on July 27th, 1962 discontinued business of replacing furnaces went out of that portion of the business wherein violations had been charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.225" offset="1464299">This is July 27th, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.910" offset="1498990">On April 19th, 1963, the Federal Trade Commission petitioned the Court of Appeals to institute prosecutions of additional respondents, including the petitioner and 10 others, to institute prosecutions for criminal contempt of some 11 additional respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.542" offset="1641514">These respondents were officers of the company, directors of the company, stockholders of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.185" offset="1680071">This was a rather startling venture for the Federal Trade Commission to embark upon to petition for the institution of criminal contempt against officers, directors and stockholders of a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.731" offset="1762304">At a date some six months after there had been a complete compliance with this order, I say complete compliance because in July 27th, the new management, first of all, the petitioner resigned in May 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.255" offset="1856345">The new management took over what was once a prosperous company but now a company that they took over I think for dissolution and discharged of the salesmen, discharged all of the branch salesmen, closed down the factory so that there was compliance complete and absolute as of July 27th, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.589" offset="1961775">And on April 19, when this petition for the first time was instituted to prosecute these individuals, officers, stockholders and directors of the company, there had been complete enforcement, in fact the company was not in that type of business in which the violations occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.916" offset="2071071">Did you say that on July 7, 1962, Holland Furnace Company was taken over or was that 1963?</text>

            <text syncTime="500.380" offset="2104926">No, the Holland Furnace Company was taken over in May 1962 and on July 27th, 1962, the Holland Furnace Company did all of these things, discharged the salesmen, the branch -- the branch officers and so forth, on July 27th, 1962.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.559" offset="2305651">So it may have continued, but in any event, it did not continue in this field of utilizing salesmen to make house to house calls.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph E. Casey</label>
            <text syncTime="588.026" offset="2455489">I don't think the record show he was a large stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.098" offset="2463744">In fact I don't know whether he owned any stock after the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.322" offset="2476701">I think probably the new management had purchased his stock and other stock in order to get control.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.388" offset="2524975">Now the petition for the institution of prosecution is interesting in the way that it is drawn up.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.888" offset="2618911">It says, “Comenoley attorneys appointed here and to prosecute on behalf of the court and respectfully petition the court to institute pursuant to Section 4013 of Title 18 of the United States Code, and in conformity with Rule 42 (b) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts”.</text>

            <text syncTime="685.563" offset="2845654">I call attention to the Court if I may that in that same petition for institution of prosecution, the charges that they fail and refuse to comply with the order of the court during the period from August 5th, 1959 until December 31st, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.020" offset="2947427">And the -- may I say that that is a period 16 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.856" offset="2974804">There are 25 violations charged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.240" offset="2988283">This large company with 5000 salesmen during a period of 16 months, with salesmen at a minimum of 10 a week would bring the total number of calls to 3.5 million calls and only 25 violations out of this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.490" offset="3057351">The violations which appear on page 2 of the record are 8 in number and they prohibit the employees from representing -- they are Government agencies, they have a -- or but they are salesmen, or that they are heating con engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.108" offset="3215757">In this connection I would like to note that in the respondent's brief on page 4, I'm now taking the fourth prohibition in that order of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.426" offset="3313037">And the fourth prohibition is the outstanding one.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.623" offset="3325889">The fourth prohibition is the one that got all the publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.483" offset="3341354">The fourth prohibition is the trumpet that dropped the walls of Holland Furnace Company tumbling down.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.874" offset="3374895">It says tearing down or dismantling any furnace without the permission of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.073" offset="3407705">On page 4 -- in the respondent's brief, say 4 is dismantling furnaces without the -- without the owner's permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.029" offset="3451486">Now, there is a vast difference, dismantling is a gentle procedure of taking a part of furnace and keeping of the parts intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.297" offset="3500596">Tearing down is a smashing and destroying, and tearing down is not petty, it is not trivial, it is an offense punishable at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.147" offset="3571963">Its punishable in the State of Ohio where it is alleged -- had gone to whether this offense but some of these are supposed to have happened on four different occasions by a statute which punishes it by as much as 20 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.175" offset="3636120">So, I don’t know whether the omission of tearing down from the respondent's brief was due to a twinge of conscience or to inadvertence but I certainly wanted -- understood that the fourth prohibition is tearing down which is a crime at common law, which is a felony, and which is punishable in --</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.829" offset="5050702">Now it goes on and says -- asked the Court to determine that respondent Cheff having been afforded an opportunity to make preliminary showing why he should not be adjudged in criminal contempt of this Court, has not so shown, but the Court after such further proceedings as it determines to be just and appropriate, adjudged respondent Paul Theodore Cheff in criminal contempt of this Court and punished him for such criminal contempt in such manner as this Court deems just and proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.423" offset="5273057">For example, the Court of Appeals is not as free in its actions when it deals with one of these enforcement orders that come from the federal trade because they're compelled.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.144" offset="5483917">For example, in this particular case if you will notice that the opinion of the Court finding this respondent guilty of criminal contempt sets forth some reasons and as a basis upon which their decision is predicated that are very difficult to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.437" offset="5605125">Now, I listened yesterday to the respondent, the Government attorney say that the difference between the contempt and a crime, an ordinary crime, is that contempt crimes are refined with great accuracy and the conduct that is proscribed is very definite, so that you know what is proscribed and you know what is required, what is forbidden and what is required.</text>

            <text syncTime="2602.480" offset="10513324">And therefore to the extent that we make the policy argument in this case and in Shillitani and Pappadio, we're really directing our attention to the third subsection of Section 401 of 18 U.S.C. which speaks in terms of disobedience of court orders and decrees and not of the kinds of conduct which may be necessity would have to be dealt with by a judge without jury and quite summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.372" offset="10636831">This case concerns the violation of a judicial decree enforcing a cease and desist order of an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.498" offset="10669328">In that respect, we think it illustrates quite graphically the principal differences between a violation of a statute which we think is a crime in the constitutional sense and the violation of a court order which constitutes a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.863" offset="10730872">A statute imposes a legal duty on the world at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.794" offset="10746546">A court order imposes such a duty on particular person, in this case the corporation and of course its officers who were present and testified at the Commission hearing and had all opportunities there to participate in drafting or in the process in which the order which contained the legal duty to which they subjected was being determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.251" offset="10856364">Now, Congress delegated to the Federal Trade Commission the duty of enforcing by such cease and desist orders, the prohibition in Section 5 against unfair methods of competition in commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.522" offset="10913416">These kinds of orders may be entered under the statutory scheme only after there's been one violation by the party subject to the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.942" offset="10947166">Now, in this case, the Federal Trade Commission conducted extensive hearings to determine that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.558" offset="10969631">The testimony of 260 witnesses covering 85 hundred pages of transcript was taken in 14 cities and on the basis of that evidence, the Commission concluded that the corporation of which petitioner was the dominant head had engaged in the course of business dealings in the servicing and sale of home furnaces which operated to defraud consumers and to injure competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.970" offset="11067225">Throughout the Commission proceedings, the corporation was represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.007" offset="11083421">They had the opportunity to cross-examine witness and to present evidence and it also had the opportunity to challenge the hearing examiners' proposed findings of fact and the terms of the cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.132" offset="11131904">The Commission concluded on the basis of this extensive examination that the record and I quote, "Not only substantially but copiously supports the findings of the initial decision" and it directed the entry of an order which in very specific terms prohibited the corporation, its representatives, its employees and its agents from engaging in eight specific enumerated deceptive practices such as false representations that the salesman or government inspectors or heating engineers, that the furnaces manufactured by competitors were defective or dangerous, and various coercive sales techniques involving the dismantling of furnaces often against the will of the owners of the furnace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.854" offset="11310791">Now, the Court of Appeals enforced this order pendente lite and on reviewing the record, it then sustained the Commission's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.246" offset="11340361">Now this case involves violation of the pendente lite order but the basic constitutional issue which is whether petitioner was required by Article III of the Sixth Amendment to have a jury trial would be presented if this were a violation of the final order of the court enforcing the agency's -- the agency determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.650" offset="11430013">So in effect, what petitioner is contending is that notwithstanding all of these preliminary stages at which the specific -- at which he was a party or at least there was a corporation who was represented before the Commission, on which he had the opportunity to challenge prior to -- in effect having to obey the order if this were for example, a final order entered after the court had reviewed the underlying findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.285" offset="11528547">He is saying that he is entitled to a jury trial to determine whether the violation of a court order committed which was entered after all of these preliminary proceedings was in fact committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.432" offset="11581106">Now, before considering this question, I'd like to make it clear that the proceeding that was held here before the Court of Appeals, the criminal contempt proceeding was a criminal action in every way other than the fact that there was no grand jury, there was no indictment in effect, and there was no petty jury, but in every other way it was of plenary criminal proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.410" offset="12436982">I think those orders are particularly suitable, if you will, for this kind of a proceeding because they usually, those are the agencies which usually have cease and desist orders at one kind or another and as I was intending to come to shortly, that's precisely why the remedy of criminal contempt is so necessary and can't be substituted by civil contempt in those areas, where the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board for example enter an order directing an employer or a corporation to cease a particular practice, obviously the employer or the corporation can't or their officers can't be thrown in jail until they cease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.735" offset="12606360">They can only be proceeded against after they'd committed the violation of the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="4042.848" offset="16274787">Then he says, “In my judgment, it could reasonably be concluded that Thompson was within the meaning of that regulation, convicted in a federal -- in a federal court of a crime or crimes the result of which was a sentence to imprisonment for five years or more."</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.819" offset="16370604">In a single proceeding before a federal court, he was convicted both of violating the Smith Act and a criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.625" offset="16409893">And then there is a significant footnote at that point in which he says, “Your interpretation of the word crime as used in the regulation as including criminal contempt punishable under 18 U.S.C. 401 is I believe fully justify criminal contempt is regarded as a crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.187" offset="16508113">For most purposes, and citing Gompers versus United States and another, New Orleans versus Steamship Company, “And no reason is apparent, why for purposes of the interment regulations criminal contempt should be distinguished from any other infraction of law punishable by imprisonment.</text>
