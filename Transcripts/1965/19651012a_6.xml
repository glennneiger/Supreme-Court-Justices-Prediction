            <label>Mr. Ronald L. Goldfarb</label>
            <text syncTime="6.222" offset="128293">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.258" offset="140413">As we adjourned yesterday, I had concluded my discussion of Rule 42 and had begun to discuss the issue of the right to trial by jury for criminal contempts with severe sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.684" offset="190151">Picking up at that point again this morning, I could do no better than to begin by referring to the particular provisions of the constitution which apply to this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.437" offset="237171">Article 3 Section 2 states that the trial of all crimes, except in the case of impeachment, shall be by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.892" offset="270921">The Sixth Amendment guarantees a public and speedy trial by an impartial jury in all criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.700" offset="302164">This Court, throughout history, has treated contempt in various ways at different times but, consistently, it has treated contempt as a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.539" offset="353573">In the Gompers case, which I mentioned yesterday, it considered criminal contempt a crime for the purposes of invocation of the statute of limitations for crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.091" offset="391711">In ex parte Grossman, this Court considered criminal contempt to crime for the purposes of the use of the pardon power of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.650" offset="425984">In the Creekmore case, Creekmore against the United States, this Court considered criminal contempt a crime, insofar as classifying the contemnor as a convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.131" offset="467884">In the New Orleans Steam Shift case, criminal contempt was called by this Court a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.257" offset="496410">In the Gompers case, this Court held that the right to counsel and compulsory process applied to criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.166" offset="523995">Indeed, the statutes hold that, if contempt may be inherently another crime as well such as perjury or obstruction of justice, there again, the right to trial by jury applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.700" offset="570180">But this Court has hesitated to take the one final step and say that contempt is indeed a crime as envisioned by Article 3 and by the Sixth Amendment, and therefore, it warrants trial by jury in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.750" offset="622320">This issue was dealt within the Gompers case, 233 United States, by Mr. Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.112" offset="647816">And in dealing with this case which is very ap -- could be the very appellee applied to the instant case, Mr. Justice Holmes with his very special ability to succinctly and brilliantly see through a complicated matter and describe it as clearly as anyone, said the following, and I might add, that this case also involved the Sixth Amendment in having to do with the right to the application of the statute of limitations for crimes in general to criminal contempts and the contempt in this case also involves disobedience of a court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.802" offset="798595">Mr. Justice Holmes said, “These contempts are infractions of the law, visited with punishment as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.422" offset="829106">If such acts are not criminal, we are in error as to the most fundamental character of crimes as that word has been understood in English speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.358" offset="860766">So truly are they crimes, that it seems to be proved that in the early law, they were punished only by the usual criminal procedures.”</text>
            <text syncTime="197.290" offset="892531">And yet, this Court and other lower federal courts have persisted in categorizing for the purposes of trial by jury, criminal contempts as sui generis.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.644" offset="937984">In other words, we take a man and say that he is a convict, that he has committed a criminal offense, that the criminal statute of limitations applies, that he's going to jail, that he loses all his civil rights and when we locked him up, he says, “what have I done?”</text>
            <text syncTime="221.312" offset="988662">We say “you haven't committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.712" offset="994200">You've committed a sui generis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="225.043" offset="1003499">I suggest that arose by any other name, if we look at we're doing in contempt cases, in an existential way, we're saying to a man, “You've done something wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.645" offset="1041951">Society will not put up with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.475" offset="1053236">We're going to punish you for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.954" offset="1059192">We're going to put the machinery of our government into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.119" offset="1071835">We're going to take you out of society.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.642" offset="1077896">We're going to deprive you of your rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.463" offset="1085210">We're going to call you a convict and put you in prison”, and we still say to the man, “No, you haven't committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.979" offset="1111333">You committed only a sui generis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="254.981" offset="1123244">In defense of this position, the government states in its brief that the right to trial -- to no trial by jury or the fact that there is no right to trial by jury is a long and historical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.406" offset="1169011">Well, that isn't really a complete statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.676" offset="1182072">The trend, both in the United States Congress and the United States Courts, has consistently been, and in recent days has become -- this has become more so, away from the denial of the right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.957" offset="1239228">We start -- we may start with the first federal legislation on the subject which is the Judiciary Act of 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.459" offset="1269217">It's been conceded by most commentators that the contempt power that was granted by that statute was a contempt power which existed in common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.234" offset="1312266">It is unknown and people have speculated what exactly that power was, what the outer reaches were.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.894" offset="1338911">I suggest, and I read a lot of contempt cases and I read the history of this, that there is no absolute clear answer to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.820" offset="1370676">I think that the government grasps its straws when it suggest in its brief that Thomas Jefferson had, at the time the Constitution was being written, a 15-volume track in his library in Monticello.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.686" offset="1418115">And, in that -- in one volume of that 15-volume track, on one page is the statement that contempts are treated summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.677" offset="1450088">Now, if my history is correct, I believe, Thomas Jefferson when the Bill of Rights was being written was in France.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.367" offset="1472867">But, the Government will imply that one page in that 15-volume track to all the constitutional framers.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.246" offset="1496377">I suggest that this game can be played on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.832" offset="1514663">There was a 1958 Michigan law review article which discussed this subject and pointed out that one of the prime law dictionaries used at the time of the Constitution's framing was Jacob's Law Dictionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.511" offset="1565445">And, Jacob's Law Dictionary had said summary contempts violated the Magna Carta's right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.653" offset="1590000">The article also pointed out that one of the books that we -- were used by the framers often was Gilbert's History and Practice of Common Pleas, which said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.244" offset="1628348">But I can't urge to this Court that because one or two books said yes and one or two books said no, that this was what the people had in their minds at the time they wrote the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.644" offset="1669935">Moreover, I would suggest that nobody can.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.123" offset="1683832">Moreover, I don't think it's that important because we shouldn't necessarily be bound by what was thought proper a 150 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.371" offset="1712880">Then Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said in one of his articles on this subject and having to do with petty offenses and the right to trial by jury in the Harvard Law Review, “At least let us not import into the Constitution of the United States discredited practices of Stuart England.”</text>
            <text syncTime="419.035" offset="1779545">What is the modern --</text>

            <text syncTime="420.378" offset="1784874">I didn't quite -- I didn't quite get that.</text>

          <turn speaker="ronald_l_goldfarb" startTime="423.174" stopTime="556.926">
            <label>Mr. Ronald L. Goldfarb</label>
            <text syncTime="423.174" offset="1796054">He said, “At least let us not import into the Constitution of the United States, the discredited practices of Stuart England.”</text>
            <text syncTime="429.999" offset="1823326">He was talking about the summary trial for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.030" offset="1843493">I would suggest to the Court that in considering this issue again, that they look at the modern treatment of the problem by the United States Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.083" offset="1871705">In 1914, in -- the Clayton Act was passed and it guaranteed a right to trial by jury for contempts arising under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.993" offset="1907336">And in every piece of legislation from the United State Congress from 1914 until last year's -- 1964 Civil Rights Act, Congress has done the same in stronger terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.067" offset="1951640">In 1932, the Norris-LaGuardia Act was passed and it guaranteed the right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.749" offset="1974418">When Rule 42 was promulgated, it too preserved the right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.685" offset="1994062">The 1957 Civil Rights Act, when it was passed, it included a right to trial by jury which this Court's dictum in the Barnett case might well have followed because there, the right to trial by jury is only guaranteed where the sentence is over 45 days or $300.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.950" offset="2063130">In the Landrum-Griffin Act of 1959, which setup a certain kind of contempt, it was provided that trials by jury would be provided for those criminal contempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.797" offset="2106598">Right up until last year, 1964 Civil Rights Act, when this was debated for quite a long time on the floor of Congress and it was decided to go beyond what this Court had ruled just before that debate began as to the right to trial by jury, they guarantee the right to trial by jury for all criminal contempts arising under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.679" offset="2186115">Indeed, they came close to passing a law that would've made it for all crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.791" offset="2206490">Congress also, it's interesting, passed the statute in 1857 changing its summary power to one which is now preceded with by indictment, trial by jury, and the arguments that were made then and that are made now, and which I suggest are boggy arguments that it would collapse if the legislative process couldn't go on, have failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.033" offset="2295515">I think everyone agrees that we now have one of the most dexterous and busy and effective Congresses and that the legislative process have been able to go on.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.433" offset="2949099">The sentences reflect this.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.299" offset="2984521">-- rather than going into all of the philosophical analysis and reasons why I would stand on the dissent, Mr. Justice Black in the Green case, which more eloquently than I could ever sum it up, stated the reasons why they should apply across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.783" offset="3050454">But I do suggest to the Court that if the Court does not feel or if the majority of the Court does not feel that it could go this far, and I suggest that this is quite a different Court from the Green case, and that we have a new experience since the Green case, that the rules suggested in the Barnett case is a very wise one.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.107" offset="3127777">I think it's a wise one for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.876" offset="3138853">Aside from the constitutional issue, what are the basic strong feelings that have been expressed on both sides of the issue of whether or not there should be right to trial by jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="770.035" offset="3183470">Those who feel that there should never be a right to trial by jury most ordinarily say that courts must have some power to deal summarily with certain kinds of obstructive and demoralizing things that go on in its presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.378" offset="3232893">Now, without this power, the judicial process would be denigrated if courts couldn't function and it would be time consuming and wasteful.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.159" offset="3271973">On the other side of the argument, those who argue for the right to trial by jury feel -- and they've been borne out by experience since the Green case that this is an abusable kind of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.849" offset="3318784">The Government argues that we need a summary power because of civil rights cases in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.412" offset="3341040">Well, the same summary power is used against the Negroes in the south by the state court judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.251" offset="3360371">If this -- to get back to the point, the argument against the right -- for the right to trial by jury is that courts shouldn't be able to avoid the constitutional protections if they are going to, in fact, treat a man as a criminal and put him in jail for long periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.715" offset="3422229">The sentences have gone as high as four years in recent times without a trial by jury and sometimes without even a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.902" offset="3454934">The beauty, it seems to me, of the footnote in the Barnett case is that it balances.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.628" offset="3473847">It preserves, on the one hand, some right of the courts to deal summarily in those extreme cases and yet, on the other hand, it guards against the kind of thing that Mr. Justice Clark mentioned in the Barnett case, that Mr. Justice Black has consistently mentioned, that Mr. Chief Justice Warren mentioned in the Brown case, that has concerned everyone who has considered the contempt power and that is, that the sentences are just getting abusive, the courts can't keep reviewing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.258" offset="6108453">That's the way I read Mr. Justice Harlan's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.923" offset="6119111">But since that time, sentences have soared and have been typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.809" offset="6134575">Indeed, the instant case is just one arising out of an investigation in the southern district and I understand that there are four or five petitions for cert pending in this Court now in which the sentences were one year and two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.505" offset="6189432">I might also add that in some of those cases, Rule 42 (b) was proceeded -- was used as the procedure, and apparently, leaving the Second Circuit -- the rights of individuals in the Second Circuit to depend on which judge or which prosecutor he's dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.594" offset="6253798">But in any event, with regard to the right to trial by jury, it is not at all as clear as the Government's brief urges that we have traditionally just simply denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.248" offset="6300400">In the 1965 American Bar Association Journal, the then President of the ABA, Mr. Louis Powell, speaking at an ABA group surely no radical organization said, “The contempt power has been regarded always with uneasy distrust by Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.302" offset="6368632">It is at best, a tolerated anomaly to the fundamental principle of trial by jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.631" offset="6389948">I suggest that he's right and that if the Court should, through it -- under its supervisory powers or under its constitutional interpretation of the -- of Article 3 in the Sixth Amendment, decide that there should be right to trial by jury, it would not at all be such a radical departure from what has been going on in the Congress and in the courts and in the thoughtful discussions of this subject through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.980" offset="6491303">One point that Mr. Justice Harlan raised yesterday and which came up again in my conversation with Mr. Justice Stewart is whether or not the power of the Appellate Courts to reduce sentences is really a sufficient enough guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.322" offset="6556609">I suggested yesterday, in answer to that question, that constitutional rights aren't matters of grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.841" offset="6574686">You either have them or you don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.709" offset="6582209">But, I thought about it further last night and feel that it warrants even a fuller answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.636" offset="6609899">First of all, the administrator of courts has pointed out in a speech last week and that I've read a report in the newspapers that the appellate case load is burgeoning and that if -- if anything, we don't need more kinds of policing jobs in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.561" offset="6677608">Secondly, I would point out that this kind of argument is really a parallel to the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.787" offset="6702477">I believe that was raised when this Court considered Betts and Brady in the Gideon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.353" offset="6728808">Of course, there are other issues involved there, but in -- really, in Gideon, didn't you say that it's not enough to reverse convictions where the right of counsel is taken away only where a man is deprived of his rights or hurt, that the case-by-case approach isn't sufficient?</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.014" offset="6791398">Well, I think -- this is how I interpret it, that if the man is entitled to his right to counsel, he was entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.247" offset="6820342">I suggest that, as the Gideon case eliminated the case by case ad hoc approach for right to counsel cases, that the Barnett case did the same with regard to sentences which are severe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2100.492" offset="8505344">He took his case to the courts and was turned down on the very precedence we've discussed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.724" offset="8526242">Then, he took his case to the Pennsylvania legislature where he was represented by a lawyer named William Finley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.464" offset="8549230">Finley said then, that it would be absurd to say that the rights of Americans, that American freemen should be no greater than those of the subject of King George.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.081" offset="8583711">He said that the right to is -- that allowing summary punishments of contempt would do just that and he said, “Such a ruling would involve the sophistry of the schools and the jargon of the law to pervert and corrupt the explicit language of the Constitution.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2160.082" offset="8743685">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.779" offset="8762493">I would like to turn first to the procedural issue whether the district judge here erred in proceeding under Rule 42 (a), which of course authorizes the judge to proceed forthwith if he certifies that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in his actual presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.281" offset="8872521">That is a precise description of the case we're dealing here with here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.294" offset="8900524">The contempt was committed in his presence and he certified that he saw and heard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.074" offset="8927692">Now, faced with this, petitioner says in its brief -- in his brief, and I quote from it, “Certainly, the distinguishing factor between the application of Rule 42 (a) and the application of Rule 42 (b) is not whether the event occurred in the presence of the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.882" offset="9014941">Frankly, I don't understand that, unless it means that certainly, the rule doesn't mean what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.316" offset="9052662">And I'm not aided by the single citation which -- with which that proposition is adorned with reference to the case of Panico versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.058" offset="9091636">Now, it's quite true that Panico was a contempt case and that it was preceded against under Rule 42 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.210" offset="9120162">It's also true that this Court sent the case back for a hearing, but it didn't send it back for a hearing as to whether the contempt occurred in the presence of a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.892" offset="9158928">It sent it back for a further hearing because the judge had evidence before him which cast out on Panico's sanity and the Court concluded that there was a need for observation of this man, an expert testimony, and a further hearing on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.818" offset="9226637">This case, it seems to us, is completely controlled by Graham against United States, decided only five or six years ago, followed a year later in Levine against United States, and Judge McClain in the instant case conscientiously and meticulously followed the exact procedure which this Court had only recently approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.787" offset="9322559">Your Honors will find that every single factor which the majority opinion in Brown relied on is present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.881" offset="9354846">I shall also point out in a few moments, that certain factors upon which the dissenting Justices relied in brown are absent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.590" offset="9385775">But to do that, it's necessary first for me to review briefly the sequence of events, and I propose to show that there was no percipito -- precipitous action taken by the judge here, and that matters were fully explored and that there were no unresolved issues of fact before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.260" offset="9468426">This all began with a subpoena answered by the petitioner on July 31, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.698" offset="9506147">The Assistant United States Attorney in charge advised him that the grand jury was investigating violations of the Communications Act and of 18 U.S.C. 1952, a statute which has to do with interstate travel or transportation in aid of racketeering enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.317" offset="9584619">Petitioner was also advised of his Fifth Amendment privilege which he proceeded to claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.816" offset="9610637">He was then told that since the inquiry related to violations of the Communications Act, he would have immunity under the terms of that statute for any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he testified -- was compelled to testify after having claimed his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.632" offset="9685870">He was again directed to answer and again -- and at this point, again refused.</text>

            <text syncTime="2544.874" offset="10282820">The next day, after this July 31st refusal to testify, the petitioner was brought before the District Court, his counsel with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.557" offset="10321586">Judge McClain advised him that this was not a contempt hearing and that he wished to satisfy himself before taking any further steps for issuing any directions that if petitioner answered the grand jury's questions, he would have an immunity broad enough to protect him from any possible prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.878" offset="10402879">The judge, after hearing argument, and he heard petitioner's counsel fully, concluded that petitioner, contrary to his counsel's contention would have full immunity if he testified in a proceeding in which the Government was investigating Communications Act violations even though it was also investigating other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.658" offset="10490023">He then ruled that in order to make it perfectly clear that the grand jury was investigating the Communications Act violations, among other things, the subpoena issued to the petitioner should recite the fact that the Communications Act violations were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.875" offset="10570898">That was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.763" offset="10574451">A new subpoena was issued with this recitation and petitioner appeared approximately a week later, on August 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.540" offset="10613530">The result was a reenactment of the first appearance before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.603" offset="10641742">Petitioner and his counsel were again summoned before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.901" offset="10655013">This was of the second appearance before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.916" offset="10671000">The judge heard argument on the afternoon of August 7th, during which petitioner's counsel once more contended at some length that the immunity statute was inapplicable or was insufficient when the grand jury was investigating other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.499" offset="10741321">Far from proceeding with unseemly haste, the judge adjourned the proceedings until the following day in order to give the matter further thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.250" offset="10776325">Petitioner and his counsel appeared the judge a third time on the morning of August 8.J</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.493" offset="10805373">udge McClain ruled at this point that he was completely satisfied that petitioner would have full protection under the immunity statute if he testified, and he directed him to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.809" offset="10854588">Petitioner was taken before the grand jury promptly thereafter and he again refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.922" offset="10883009">Thereupon, petitioner and his attorney, government counsel, and the grand jury appeared together in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.799" offset="10930552">The grand jury reporter was sworn and read the transcript of the proceedings which had just transpired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.619" offset="10961899">And, at this point, the fourth appearance before the judge, Judge McClain ordered petitioner to be sworn and, then and there, directed him to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.306" offset="11012577">The Court ruled, when he again refused, that this was a contempt in the Court's presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.348" offset="11040789">He stated that he had repeatedly heard and considered all of the arguments of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.515" offset="11061478">He had previously ruled that he would not consider evidence as to the motives of the grand jury and that he had concluded that the arguments made by petitioner, that petitioner would not have full immunity, were not well grounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.151" offset="11147995">He then sentenced petitioner to a year in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.305" offset="11168580">He admitted petitioner to bail so that he could make his legal arguments on appeal without suffering commitment in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.149" offset="11211943">He also stated on the record that he would entertain a motion for a reduction of sentence if petitioner so moved after having testified.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.409" offset="14312991">I do want to treat the third question in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.469" offset="14341204">The issue of a right to jury trial is -- of course, has been extensively briefed and argued in recent years before this Court in both the Green and in the Barnett cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.459" offset="14405256">I shall only review very briefly the principal arguments which we advanced in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.632" offset="14437857">Our contention, of course, basically is that the framers did not treat contempt as a crime or a as a criminal prosecution in the sense that those terms are used in Article 3 and in the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.256" offset="14508387">We relied in Green and Barnett upon the English common law, upon the fact that all of the commentators who were known to the colonists had stated flatly that contemnors were subject to attachment and to trial by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.494" offset="14573380">And, we pointed to what seemed to us to be a fairly uniform practice among the colonies of which I shall say more later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.713" offset="14610265">We also relied heavily upon the first Judiciary Act of 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.258" offset="14636387">That is the statute, after all, which was reported by a Senate Judiciary Committee, a majority of whose members were members of the constitutional convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.959" offset="14675257">And that Act unequivocally conferred upon the courts in their discretion, the power to punish contempts by fine or imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.000" offset="14715382">I should like to add a footnote to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.155" offset="14723950">The Congress in 1790, passed the first General Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.131" offset="14747878">The General Crimes Act, which set forth all of the offenses which Congress, at that time, wished to make crimes, made no reference whatever to contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.869" offset="14794898">Contempt was dealt with exclusively in the statute which created the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.777" offset="14826454">And I submit that the only satisfactory explanation of that is that the first Congress regarded that power in conformity with the established tradition and practice that they knew as an inherent power of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.840" offset="14894686">Now, from the beginning until the present day, the suggestion that a jury trial is constitutionally required in contempt cases had been rejected by this Court in what Justice Harlan termed in the Green case as “a long and unbroken line of decisions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.354" offset="14976815">I think, indeed, that I am right in suggesting that, until the Green case itself decided some 170 years after the Constitution, not a single Justice had dissented from this view.</text>

            <text syncTime="3804.530" offset="15321527">Its very authority to function effectively may, in some instances, be at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.505" offset="15353396">The Attorney General, the Solicitor General, the Department of Justice are particularly and gravely concerned by the problems which are incident to the enforcement of injunctive decrees of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.704" offset="15418180">Injunctions, of course, are characteristically issued when there is a grave threat of the irreparable injury, perhaps a threat to the fundamental rights of those who invoke its protective cloak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.888" offset="15482964">In the last decade, certainly, we have seen many instances in which injunctive orders were issued to guard the rights, not to mention the lives and the property, of minority groups seeking to assert their constitutional rights as declared in decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.851" offset="15574810">Time and again, the local federal judge had been called upon to enjoin conduct which would interfere, perhaps violently interfere, with the exercise of those rights in communities where the dominant majority was a validly hostile, oftentimes, communities where not a single voice among the majority could be found to defend the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.737" offset="15706363">We believe that a rule which would say that the federal judge could vindicate his lawful order in such a situation only with the unanimous concurrence of 12 members of that community would be a very serious setback to attempts with which the Attorney General is charged in his efforts to vindicate constitutional and other rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="4747.439" offset="19093086">If I may turn to the last point, the suggestion which comes from the footnote in the Barnett opinion that contempt punishment should be limited to those associated with petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.054" offset="19175633">That suggestion, I take it may have been very largely prompted by the historical discussion which appeared in Justice Goldberg's dissent in the Barnett case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.390" offset="19232893">Your Honors will recall that he concluded largely on the basis of an examination of five colonial statutes, that at least five of the original 13 colonies had specific statutory limit on the sanctions for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.904" offset="19322964">He goes on to state that some of the other colonies adopted limitations after the ratification of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.750" offset="19362356">Concluding that these statutes did not prescribe severe penalty, he suggests that the colonies may have regarded contempt as akin to a petty offense in terms of the punishments which might be imposed therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.722" offset="19434245">Now, responding to this hypothesis, we have undertaken an elaborate study of the colonial statutes and precedents, a great many of which are available only in manuscript form.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.957" offset="19487222">The department study was conducted over a period of many months by some nice or 10 lawyers working under the direction of Joseph Smith, a professor of legal history at Columbia who is with me today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.090" offset="19547721">Professor Smith has devoted many years to the study of colonial materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.721" offset="19570291">Now, the results of this study are set forth in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.594" offset="19589726">Because of the relative inaccessibility of the materials, we have endeavored to set everything down rather than to proceed more selectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.564" offset="19629641">In the brief time I have remaining, I cannot begin to cover all of the detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.229" offset="19648240">I shall try to develop in broad strokes some of the general conclusions which we think are warranted, relying upon our printed documentations, printed appendix, to provide further documentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.621" offset="19713860">I'd also like to address myself with some particularity to the statutory materials, upon which Justice Goldberg relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.404" offset="19748968">I shall point out that we think there were very serious errors, omissions, and misinterpretations in his presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.383" offset="19792854">I hasten to add that the reasons for that are quite understandable, the materials are fragmentary, and they're difficult to gather.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.629" offset="19825873">The Justice did not have any briefing on this point and he obviously didn't have the time and the facilities for an exhaustive study such as we've undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.160" offset="19872057">We've shown our discussion of the history that, first, that the common law commentators known to the colonies were unanimous in their view that contempt was punishable by fine or imprisonment or, in some instances, by corporal punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.103" offset="19959829">We have not found anything in any of the commentators to suggest that the power was thought to be confined to the imposition of trivial penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.385" offset="20000893">Now, this is of some importance because the colonial courts were, of course, guided by the English common law even when the common law was not received as binding upon them.</text>

            <text syncTime="5029.130" offset="20219904">Let me, before coming to the cases, say generally of the statutes that we have not found any act which comprehensively limited the power to punish contempt or any statute which set a maximum for willful disobedience of an injunction or a decree of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.375" offset="20324916">There were, to be sure, various statutes which limited the punishment which might be imposed for specified forms of contempt, such as the non-appearance of a juror or the use of profanity in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.314" offset="20384580">Kindly turn to the statutes upon which Mr. Justice Goldberg relied in his opinion in Barnett, he stated at page 742 of his opinion, that the South Caroline statute permitted a fine not exceeding £10 for any contempt by word or gesture and a fine of the discretion of the Court for anyone who should strike or use any violence in the said courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.879" offset="20494921">It did not permit imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.192" offset="20508191">Justice Goldberg's citation was to a 1731 Act dealing with misconducts in a courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.415" offset="20545076">We have found that another provision of the same statute provides, this is set out in Appendix 328, that if a witness fails to appear or give evidence at a trial for a felony, he shall be dealt with according to the order of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.851" offset="20626787">Still, another statute which was not noticed, provided for a £500 fine, not -- in contrast to the £10 fine in this 1731 statute, a £500 fine for a grand juror who willfully failed to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.797" offset="20678510">£500 was, of course a huge sum in that day when petty offenses were characteristically punished by fines measured in shillings or a few pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.621" offset="20757817">On the same page of this opinion, Justice Goldberg referred to a Maryland statute of 1785 having to do with disobedience of the Courts of Chancery, and he stated that it permitted no punishment exceeding £10 current money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.655" offset="20821974">Our examination shows that this provision is actually one relating to civil contempt and that the £10 provision has to do with purgation of that contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.728" offset="20870248">The very statute which was cited provides that another point, and here, dealing with criminal contempt, that the chancellor may impose indefinite mprisonment for disobedience of his rule, order, or decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.249" offset="20936391">An earlier Maryland statute noticed last term or two terms ago dealing with violent misconduct in the courtroom authorized any corporal punishment not extending to the taking of life, which the Court might see fit to impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.340" offset="21012773">In 1788, Maryland statute provided for £100 penalty for a sheriff who failed to secure proper jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.212" offset="21052270">This was a monetary penalty far and excess to that associated with petty offenses in the colonies or permitted under the Maryland Petty Offense Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5247.973" offset="21095215">In the case of Connecticut, Justice Goldberg referred to a 1667 statute which authorized, in the case of courtroom misconduct, such punishment as the Court might have judged most suitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.743" offset="21150386">And then, he found significance in a proviso which limited to a small fine or to two hours in the stocks, the punishment which a single judge might impose for such a contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.041" offset="21207542">This provision does not apply to all contempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.991" offset="21219349">More pointedly, it has no application whenever two or more judges sit in a case, which was commonly the situation in the Connecticut colonies above the Justice of the Peace level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.014" offset="21275460">We have additionally pointed to passages from writings of the Chief Justice of Connecticut, Zephania Swift, which spoke unequivocally of the plenary power of contempt enjoined by the Connecticut Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.905" offset="21335019">The fourth colony that Justice Goldberg referred to was New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.566" offset="21353618">He cited in his opinion, enacted February 9, 1791, which permitted imprisonment for contempt not exceeding 10 days or a fine of £10.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.726" offset="21414327">This provision related to non-appearance of a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.583" offset="21425716">It did not relate to contempts generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.786" offset="21438568">And, as we show, New Hampshire had numerous other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.185" offset="21456123">For example, wholly discretionary punishments were authorized by statutes relating to the abuse of court officials and misconducts in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.679" offset="21498128">Indeed, on February 16, 1791, one week after the passage of the statute to which the Justice referred, the New Hampshire legislature provided for imprisonment up to 12 months and a fine of £90 for interference with service of court practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="5530.202" offset="22224227">The penalties were ordinarily fines, whereas, in the case of petty offenses, it appears that the outer limit was probably about £10 for petty offenses in most of the colonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.429" offset="22285040">We have found cases of contempt, numerous cases in which the penalties were £20, £40, £50, £100, and even £200 for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.422" offset="22325060">There are cases of corporal -- severe corporal punishment as well, particularly in the earlier period.</text>

            <text syncTime="6517.628" offset="26173837">Secondly, I would like to say that the Solicitor -- in response to the Solicitor's c -- suggestion that the counsel didn't complain about the closeness of the proceeding, if the Court will just look at this, and it's a very short record on page 32 and 33, half of the whole adjudication and sentencing is the counsel asking for an open proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6541.329" offset="26268714">He was turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.081" offset="26271744">The Court says it's open and he protested and said “but this is sealed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.770" offset="26286477">Then, finally, the Court made its adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="6547.786" offset="26294523">I suggest if he had gone any further with this judge, he might have been held in contempt himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6552.715" offset="26314271">Thirdly, with respect to Mr. Justice -- former Mr. Justice Goldberg's dissent in the Barnett case, I would say that even if this Court finds that the history was not good, certainly, it was very wise arbitration and the presentation of a very just solution to an impasse that this Court has had to face for so many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.304" offset="26404551">It's a very balanced and reasonable and wise compromise to the two extreme views that have been prevailing through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6585.448" offset="26445197">Fourth, I would say that more so in contempt than in the case of any other crime could it be argued that there is truly a need for a trial by jury, the insulating aspect of a jury, more so in the case where the person who is the offended party and the victim is also the adjudicator.</text>
            <text syncTime="6605.393" offset="26524923">More so, even in any other crime it could be argued is there a need for a trial by jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="6610.544" offset="26545507">Finally, with regard to the question of the severity of the sentence which this Court -- a number of the members of the Court raised or just point out that, in the 1964 statistics for crimes in the United States which I just checked with the statistician for the Administrative of the Federal Courts, of all the felony convictions in the United States last year where there were sentences, one -- only 39% of those convictions did then received a sentence of a year or more so that this man, without a hearing, without a trial by jury, was up there with the worst convicted convicts of this country in terms of the severity of his sentence, that there can be any doubt that a year is severe.</text>
