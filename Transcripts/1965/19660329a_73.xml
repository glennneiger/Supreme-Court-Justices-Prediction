            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="8.985" offset="139264">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.886" offset="150967">When the Court rose at the recess yesterday, I had completed my discussion of the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.606" offset="177821">Now, I'd like to turn to showing that the District Court correctly held defendants have monopolized that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.210" offset="208227">The offense of monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act involves two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.723" offset="230275">The first is the existence of the monopoly power and the second is the conscience or willful acquisition or maintenance of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.559" offset="269563">And we think the record in this case shows that defendants possessed both of those elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.094" offset="295790">The monopoly power has been described as the power to fix prices or to exclude competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.057" offset="331630">Now when -- in this case, when Grinnell acquired an 87% interest in these companies by acquiring -- controlling interest of them over four-year period, it put together a combination, in one hand, of the overwhelming share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.715" offset="406235">And this kind of a share of the market under the control of one person is ordinarily enough, we think, to show the existence of monopoly power.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.673" offset="446046">I'd like to refer this Court to a passage of the opinion of Judge Learned Hand in the Alcoa case which this Court‘s specifically approved in the subsequent American Tobacco decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.969" offset="499231">There, Judge Hand stated, “We may start therefore with the premise that to have combined 90% of the producers of ingot would have been to “monopolize” the ingot market and so far as concerns the public interest, it can make no difference whether an existing competition is put an end to or whether prospective competition is prevented.”</text>
            <text syncTime="123.277" offset="596511">Now in the Cellophane case, this Court assumed that if Cellophane were the relevant market that du Pont's control of 75% of that market would be enough to give du Pont monopoly power.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.436" offset="657115">In this case, the share of the market 87% is very close to the 90% that Alcoa had.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.021" offset="691493">And in addition here to the just the percentages themselves, we have other -- in the issue of monopoly power, the existence of substantial price discriminations, and the further fact that within this market, after the three companies which Grinnell acquired, there's no one else that has anywhere near this share.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.866" offset="766830">The two largest companies after that have roughly 1.5% and then it goes down very rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.633" offset="793893">Now, the combination that Grinnell put together in this case not only acquired this large share of the market but it further prevented the resumption of competition among the defendant alarm companies that was a -- to be anticipated when these old restrictive agreements were about to expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.536" offset="881560">Shortly before the agreements were due to expire in the late 1940s, Grinnell and ADT had a series of discussions as to what the future relationships of the company should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.675" offset="934118">Under the old agreement, Grinnell was supplying these devices in return for 25% share of the revenues generated by the services for which the devices were provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.698" offset="978213">And Grinnell indicated it would like to continue this arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.273" offset="992423">But ADT's counsel advised that in its view, this arrangement by which Grinnell had supplied the devices was an illegal exclusive dealing agreement that violated the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.519" offset="1041429">And during the course of these discussions between Grinnell and ADT, Mr. Fleming, the president of Grinnell stated as follows, and this is at page 1433 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.677" offset="1098062">Mr. Fleming stated that Grinnell -- that he did not feel that Grinnell would be prepared to go completely out of the supervisory business in 1954 even if no agreement were reached for the ADT company.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.466" offset="1153233">As we very definitely had in mind in such contingency, and we're preparing now to go into the central station business generally, including both supervisory, burglary etcetera service, if this became necessary, although, we would still much prefer to renew our arrangements with the ADT on a fair basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.212" offset="1236198">Now at the trial, Mr. Fleming testified that there were more than -- there's more than one reason why they acquired Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.328" offset="1268694">He stated as Holmes' counsel has advised the court that it was acquired as an investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.947" offset="1287189">He also stated that they had another reason for acquiring Holmes and this is at 676 of the record which was -- so that we would know something about or have someone in the organization who knew something about the burglar alarm business, so we could compete with ADT.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.336" offset="1356675">And he also testified at record 688 that after Grinnell had acquired both AFA and Holmes, and before it acquired ADT, the company considered whether we would merge Holmes and AFA, whether we would be in a better position to compete with ADT.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.387" offset="1432952">So this record we think shows that prior to the time that Grinnell had acquired ADT, it was seriously considering going in to the central station business.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.990" offset="1483316">Now, the effect of its acquiring ADT was to eliminate any possibility of this competition because it had now combined in one source these different companies which were potential competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.557" offset="1537651">And thus in effect, the result of this acquisition and combination was to continue the very restrictive agreements that had been going on for almost half a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.447" offset="1589164">And in the passage from Alcoa that I just referred to, Judge Hand pointed out that the combination is bad if it restricts not only actual existing competitions, but also potential competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.480" offset="1641305">Now, the second element of illegal monopolization, the conscious or willful acquisition and maintenance of that power is also we think clearly shown by this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.526" offset="1681429">I have referred at some length yesterday to the various restrictive and exclusionary practices which ADT engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.088" offset="1711731">And it seems to us that these practices clearly show that in this case, ADT did not have the monopoly power thrust upon it, and that Grinnell, certainly, when it acquired these companies and combined them, it didn't have the power thrust upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.824" offset="1774634">It went out and acquired these companies and they have this combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.040" offset="1787486">Now, it's true that there's nothing in this record to show that a -- that Grinnell in any way actively interfered in the management of the subsidiaries, but it had a clear control over these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.186" offset="1832103">It had anywhere from 80 to a 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.112" offset="1843806">It nominated the boards of directors, it controlled the boards of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.991" offset="1859375">Mr. Fleming, the president of Grinnell was also the president of ADT and we think that is clearly enough to prevent -- that Grinnell is responsible for the continuation of this monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.055" offset="1907545">And to sum it up, I'd like to refer to the statement at page 782 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.429" offset="1937115">This is one -- a passage from the opinion -- I'm sorry, 762 of the record from the opinion of the District Court, in which the District Court said that describing the share of the market of these companies, that this share of the market rests not on the scale, efficiency, and fairness side of defendants, not even on their neutrally normal business matters, but on violations of per se rules governing restraints of trade and on acquisitions indicating that growth was a response to external grasp, not to internal grip.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.862" offset="2086849">So that we think that on this record and on this holding by the District Court, the District -- that the conclusion is that Grinnell and the defendants acquired and held this share of the market as the result of practices which make the possession of this power illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.770" offset="2166471">And we therefore find it unnecessary to reach the District Court's suggestion and the statements that illegal monopolization maybe presumed merely from showing an overwhelming percentage of the market without regard to any other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.818" offset="2238673">This is -- the court said this is a couple of questions, but we think this record and this indication by the court to which I have referred, shows that without reaching that, this judgment maybe -- the finding of violation, maybe sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.844" offset="2294784">So that as we see the case on this aspect of it, this we think comes within the many decisions of this Court which have recognized that this percentage of the market obtained and held under these circumstances is enough to show illegal monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.152" offset="2372002">Now -- I would now like to turn to the next point in the case which is the question of the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.741" offset="2398333">On this aspect of the case, this is the subject of the Government's appeal in number 73.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.322" offset="2416619">We contend that the relief is inadequate in significant respects, contrary-wise the defendants claimed the relief is excessive in some respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.433" offset="2549112">I suppose so, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.819" offset="2558621">I might say Mr. Justice that neither of these two provisions which the judge included where requested by the Government below, the judge quoted this on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.480" offset="2597282">Now, I'd like to give a little of the background as the circumstances under which the relief was given in this case because we think this is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.161" offset="2631973">In the pretrial proceeding which I will discuss in more detail when I come to the discussion of a fair trial point, the judge suggested that each side should submit a draft that what relief it believed would be appropriate in the event that the Government would have prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.879" offset="2706892">And the Government submitted a proposed brief on the merits of the case and also a proposed draft of an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.097" offset="2739806">And the defendants then submitted their suggestions.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.856" offset="2754748">Now, these suggestions although phrased in the form of a consent judgment which seems to us are clearly not a consent judgment, the defendant's document, their brief on relief at page 162 begins as follows: Pursuant to this Court's order of December 18th, 1963, this brief presents Grinnell's views on the relief which would be appropriate if plaintiff were to prevail on the question of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.718" offset="2886196">This -- this isn't these were not just discussions between the parties as to the basis on which the case should be settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.379" offset="2912841">These were formal suggestions filed in the court in response to the court's requests which in turn was in response to the suggestion of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.544" offset="2957563">Now in these statements that defendants brought in response to the Government's proposal, they in substance agreed to several of the Government's proposals which are the subject of the Government's appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.650" offset="3010017">They differed as to the extent of these provisions in the form that they basically accepted our theory, and in addition two of the items in which we're appealing, they accepted the identical language used by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.668" offset="3066023">The District Court without discussing any of these proposals added a judgment which has been indicated by Mr. Sonnett, generally enjoined them from violating Act directed to Grinnell to dispose of its stock in the three alarm companies and prohibited any of these companies for making any further acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.688" offset="3150137">Now, we think this relief is inadequate and as we have set forth in our brief in at least four significant respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.209" offset="3184201">The first one which we think is the most serious is the failure in any way to do anything to dissipate the market power of ADT.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.020" offset="3227460">ADT has 73% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.936" offset="3239163">This share obviously is the keystone on which the entire combinations market power depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.926" offset="3267062">This is the foundation of this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.327" offset="3280645">And merely to break up the combination, merely to direct Grinnell to dispose of its holdings in these three alarm companies without in any way doing anything to deal with the power of ADT itself, it's not enough to restore competition in this business, because ADT's share of the market is so large in itself is monopoly power.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.043" offset="3375522">It gives ADT the very kind of power which Section 2 of the Sherman Act is directed against.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.272" offset="3400495">And indeed the defendants themselves in the District Court recognized this fact because at page 179 of the record, in their brief discussing the Government's proposal, they said in the third paragraph, “Moreover, defendants agree with the Government that if it were to prevail, some further divestiture of ADT would be appropriate i.e. we agree that in certain cities which can support two or more central stations, but where ADT now provides the only central station service, an effort should be made to establish a healthy competitor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="864.950" offset="3563186">Now of course we realized that these statements are not binding on the court but we do point out that the defendants themselves have recognized the basic reason to most of our proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.491" offset="3605295">Now, there was a short disagreement between the Government and defendants in the District Court as to how extensive this divestiture should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.971" offset="3635284">We asked the divestiture in 46 cities, the defendants suggested divestiture in 13 cities would be opposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.873" offset="3658898">We are not asking this Court to tend to work out such details that is obviously a matter for the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.866" offset="3682826">But we do urge this Court to send it back to the District Court to indicate that something should be done to break up the power of ADT.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.711" offset="3726190">Now, the other provisions --</text>

            <text syncTime="925.717" offset="3806229">In other words, we are saying that in the circumstances of this case, the failure of the District Court to require any divestiture of ADT was an error.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.032" offset="6455463">And finally, one other provision of relief is a provision giving the customers some rights to terminate these contracts before the end of five years and to give them the right to purchase them as they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.203" offset="6516172">Again, the defendants agreed with us that some form of relief along these lines is appropriate, they did not agree with us in the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.912" offset="6555042">And here again, we think this is a matter to be left to the District Court to work out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.113" offset="6579806">And now in my remaining time, I'd like to discuss the question which Mr. Sonnett devoted most of his time which is the charge of biased and prejudiced and that the defendants were denied a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.357" offset="6632782">Here again, I think a somewhat fuller statement of the facts is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.204" offset="6656188">About a month after the answers in this case were filed, in the summer of 1951, the parties entered into an exhaustive deposition procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.566" offset="6697671">They took more than a hundred different depositions throughout the country and these depositions were completed in September 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.948" offset="6731212">And after the depositions were completed, the court asked counsel when they would be ready to try the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.633" offset="6757857">And both counsels replied that they would not be ready before January of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.551" offset="6789622">Following this, there were some consent decree negotiations between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.011" offset="6807385">But parties were unable to agree upon a proposed judgment and a prehearing conference was then held at December 18th, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.749" offset="6846360">And at this conference, counsel to defendants suggested that since discovery had been completed, the next appropriate step rather than ruling on the admissibility of evidence would be to hold a prehearing on relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.256" offset="6900381">And the court, as I have then indicated, suggested that each could be very helpful if each side would have filed a brief setting forth -- first, their views as to the merits of the case, that is the Government would briefly state what it believed the record showed as to liability and then the appropriate form of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.080" offset="6975718">Now after suggesting this procedure, the court pointed out at page 129, he thought of course, in such a situation, it is quite true that the defendants are running some risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.327" offset="7036635">This caused the court necessarily in talking about such matters, will not know whether the Government's contention in interpreting the fact is correct, or the defendants' interpretation of the facts is correct, or some middle cause is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.399" offset="7092955">And presumably, if the judge makes any suggestion, they'll have to make it on the basis of a strongest possible showing of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.427" offset="7129109">And -- well, he then stated two pages later, 131, he understood what was being suggested was that the defendants were trying to ascertain what kind of relief, “I would be likely to allow if the Government's case stood virtually uncontradicted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.368" offset="7188877">The parties filed these briefs and Government studied its proposals as to relief, and also filed a 40 or 50-page brief which is not in the printed record indicating its version of the facts and why it caused the defendants to be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.990" offset="7243316">At the next hearing, after a preliminary matter had been disposed of, the Court asked if there was anything left other than setting the case for trial, and when defense counsel said, “Well, we've felt we're going to have a prehearing on relief,” and he said, “If Your Honor would indicate the relief that might be appropriate in this case, that would be helpful, so as to come to a better understanding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.344" offset="7332760">The court responded as follows: “I assure you that you would not be helped by anything I would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.378" offset="7384900">You would better -- do better to get together with the Government than run risk of what I would say from what I have seen.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.318" offset="7412694">And then he went on and said -- the judge said, “I have read enough to know that if I have to decide for the Government -- if I have to decide for the Government from what I have seen, you will not be in a position at this stage to agree to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.260" offset="7464417">In other words, we think all that the court was telling the defendants here was, they had asked them to indicate what he thought would be appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.425" offset="7497122">He had seen the defendants' proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.834" offset="7506735">He had seen what the Government has asked for, asking for and as he indicated to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.145" offset="7523976">If he had decided the case now on the basis of what the Government had said -- stated the facts were and assuming those facts, he, the defendants, would not be able to agree to the kind of relief he would deem appropriate in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.062" offset="7579669">And in view of this disposition, he decided that there was nothing left in this case to do than to set the case for trial which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.653" offset="7613942">Now, at the next hearing to which reference has been made six days later, June 3rd, when the defendants had asked the Court to put off the hearing two months and also to define with more particularity the issues as to relief, he once again, it seems to us, made the identical point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.162" offset="7684054">He said at page 281 to 282 -- that he said, he had looked at these documents as they had requested and, “I have told you that, forced by you to look, my views are more extreme than those of the Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.147" offset="7739956">Again, all he was suggesting was that if he had to decide the case on the basis of the facts which he had seen during this pretrial proceeding, his views as to relief are more extreme than the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.992" offset="7795336">He would give the defendants even greater relief -- give the Government even greater relief than the Government had sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.223" offset="7820309">Now, it was after this statement that the defendants filed the motion to disqualify Judge Wyzanski for biased and prejudiced, which Chief Judge Woodbury, we think, correctly objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.294" offset="7872554">Neither of the file -- of the two basis of this motion, the statement that Judge Wyzanski made as to what his views were as to liability or relief or the court's action of setting the case on 18 days for trial, constitutes personal bias and prejudice --</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.996" offset="8027408">He apparently, at least at the time he proposed this, found it suitable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.074" offset="8075682">I don't think they forced him to, but the point, I think, he was making was that they were the ones who had requested him to look at this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.243" offset="8104312">And therefore, they should not now be complaining that having looked at it, he concluded that there was no -- he saw no basis on which anything he could say would leave the court -- leave the parties to settle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.465" offset="8157184">Now under the statutes, the -- to be disqualified, bias and prejudice has to be personal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.600" offset="8245791">In other words, it was information that came to the judge in the course of his study of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.483" offset="8277347">And that is not enough to be personal bias and prejudice under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.024" offset="8291453">In addition, he didn't indicate we think very clearly any prejudgment of the case, the passage in which they saw and he said, “If I had to decide for the Government,” he made it very clear that, if he were going to decide for the Government on the basis of the submission of the Government had made, he thought it was a very strong case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.777" offset="8358431">Now, throughout this case, in numerous places, the judge made it very clear that he had not decided the case, that he still maintained an open mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.909" offset="8398973">Immediately after the -- at the close of the testimony at page 697 of the record, just after the end of the trial, the judge said as follows, this is in the middle of the page, “I notify you in advance and as firmly and clearly as possible that I intend, if I should find, and I underlined the words “if I should find” and underlined it four times in favor of the Government,” and then he went on to say he shall deal in his final decision not only with the questions of liability but also the questions of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.039" offset="8555499">On that same page again, he repeated the thought, “Should I deal with the problems of relief, if I should find the violation, if I file -- filed forms of decree, framed in the decree.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.828" offset="8602728">And again, at the post trial hearing after the evidence was all in -- post trial briefs had been filed, there was another hearing, the judge again made it very clear and stated explicitly that he had not decided the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.204" offset="8668139">At page 729 of the record, after there had been some colloquy between the court and defense counsel, the court said, “I don't want by any of my statements to imply that I have decided that the Government is entitled to win this case,” to which defense counsel respondent, “I appreciate that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.550" offset="8745566">And then again, two paragraphs down, the court said, “In the event that I should decide adversely to the defendants,” and on the next page he repeated this thing, “You don't need not worry that I'm going to think about any problem with relief unless and until it becomes necessary to do so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.473" offset="8813275">Now, we also don't see any basis for the claim of bias and prejudice in the fact that the court set this case for trial on a rather short notice, on 18 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.367" offset="8856848">In the circumstances, it was not unreasonable we think, the complaint in this case had been filed more than three years before, the extensive discovery had been completed more than eight months before, the Government had served upon the defendants a 200-page trial brief which set forth its theory of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.719" offset="8942216">It also had filed with the defendant various documents identifying particular evidence that it was going to rely on, and tying in particular documents to particular claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.366" offset="9000835">When the court set the case for trial in May, it was approximately eight months after both sides had indicated to the court in effect that they would be ready for trial sometime after the preceding January, that's been the past September, and the most we think that the court's action here in setting this case for trial in 18 days indicates, the most is that he perhaps was misinformed as to the extent of the defendant's preparation, whether they would be able to adequately present their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.284" offset="9144508">There's certainly nothing here to suggest bias and prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.195" offset="9160182">Now, going to trial on this notice, undoubtedly put a great deal of pressure on the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.993" offset="9183378">But the defendants make no showing or no claim here that they were, in anyway, prejudiced by being forced to go to trial in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.948" offset="9215143">They point in no evidence that they were unable to present because of the lack of preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.027" offset="9235519">And on the contrary, they presented an exhaustive case in this thing.It occupies almost one-half of the printed record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.769" offset="9310438">And let me just refer briefly to this -- putting the case in an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.976" offset="9327261">This is not the first time this technique has been utilized in antitrust cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.164" offset="9355995">Judge Wyzanski himself followed a similar technique in a case called United States v. Minnesota Mining, some years before where a great many documents were introduced in both at the beginning of the Government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.340" offset="9408763">They have another case, United States v. American Smelting &amp; Refining Company, these are two District Court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.928" offset="9439065">As this Court knows these antirust cases, our guess sometimes get out of control, the United Shoe Machinery case, there's something like 29,000 pages of documents at the trial, it took 110 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.832" offset="9486712">And in this case, Judge Wyzanski stressed to the parties the importance of trying to reduce this mass material into some -- to some manageable proportions and that is what was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.414" offset="9529031">In this case, the Government reduced its case to 307 documents, excerpts from 30 to 40 depositions, and these were, with no doubt, we started in many more documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.534" offset="9577514">We've reduced them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.697" offset="9582111">The defendants knew of all the documents that we had, and when it came time to offer this material in evidence, the judge just said that he was not going to pass upon each individual document before it came in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.020" offset="14395434">And then, we filed a petition which reasonably raised the questions under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.494" offset="14421347">That petition, as Your Honor knows, was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.989" offset="14435349">But, as a consequence of our invoking the very pretrial procedures recommended in the handbook, the court below having formed and unalterable conviction on the merits of the case, if there were any doubt about that, the court statements at the first day of the trial eliminate any conceivable doubt because, Your Honors, I believe, he cannot read the transcript of the first day of this trial without reaching the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.665" offset="14570036">I regret to say, that the court's mind was absolutely flows on the merits on the substantive questions, which were involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.639" offset="14613922">I think the words of the Court which I read yesterday appearing particularly at pages C14 to C15 of the transcript in our appendix, record 336 speak all too plainly of the judges view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.127" offset="14719875">The judge basically took the position that he was forced to form an opinion, and in this context it clearly means an opinion of the merits, we put the burden on them and it was just too bad for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.321" offset="14772642">From that point on, I think it's evident that the court's mind was closed on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.713" offset="14802213">I would like to suggest to Your Honors that this case can and perhaps should be disposed of by a consideration of the disqualifications statute in terms of today's rules of practice and practices in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.761" offset="14870444">And that the court need not necessarily reach the fair trial issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.896" offset="14890924">However, I don't mean to suggest by that the slightest, but we think we -- our position as to the fair trial is not well-founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.572" offset="14925615">But this Court have in the last 60 years of this statute's existence has squarely written on this disqualification statute only once in the Berger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.554" offset="14965635">I think that the holding of that case is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.648" offset="15001997">I think that the reasoning of that case in the light of this old statute perhaps needs clarification in terms of the procedural problems appearing in these cases, these days of the modern rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.720" offset="15070229">With respect to the question of findings, there were findings here by the court which affirmatively support Grinnell's position and I speak in this context now only if Grinnell -- it doesn't appear as I think, that the basic questions before the Court is whether Grinnell was guilty of a combination to monopolize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.206" offset="15172211">Your Honors will find on examining findings 45 and 46 which are at 756 of the record that the court made findings with respect to exclusion of competitors in price, control over prices which insofar as they go, tend to support or Grinnell's position that there where certainly no monopolization in fact, that the power to control prices or exclude competitors did not exist, in fact, and that from the market percent -- market percentage alone, assuming a proper market, you can infer it because there are findings so far as they go which negate what inference might otherwise be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.834" offset="15338663">There were three main parts of the court's decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.138" offset="15351933">Each main part of the decree was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.191" offset="15368129">There were findings in 715, 17, 18, 19, and 20, record 750 with respect to vertical integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.803" offset="15406582">Vertical integration obviously entered heavily into the court's approach to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.712" offset="15426226">The court as a matter of fact was concededly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.827" offset="15442631">This is not a vertical integration case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.804" offset="15450572">The Government has conceded that Grinnell supplied nothing to the alarm company defendants for some years prior to this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.466" offset="15485262">There was a finding with respect -- a prop I should say, the second prop, was that there was domination of the management of the alarm companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.242" offset="15532387">The Government said to you today that there was nothing to show that Grinnell actively interfered with the management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.733" offset="15558301">There's more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.960" offset="15563212">It's affirmative evidence which stands uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.590" offset="15577736">That the president of Grinnell and Grinnell did not overrule the management of the alarm companies with respect to any matter except one and that was whether they were going to have a central station in Paris.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.222" offset="15636250">Judge Wyzanski for whatever reason turned that evidence inside out and concluded just the opposite.</text>

            <text syncTime="3974.067" offset="15999666">That I think is the uncontradicted state of the record Mr. Justice White.</text>
