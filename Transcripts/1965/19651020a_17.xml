            <text syncTime="16.230" offset="168312">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.221" offset="184299">This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States, Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.826" offset="222647">The Court of Appeals decision affirmed a holding by the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, which it upheld a holding by the referee in bankruptcy's determination that the Trustee in Bankruptcy was a “judgment creditor” as that term is used in Title 26 of the United States Code, Section 6323.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.714" offset="342183">And therefore the tax mean notice of which had not been filed prior to the petition in bankruptcy and prior to the appointment of the trustee was not had been -- not filed prior to his appointment and that he therefore had priority over the federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.289" offset="428492">The issue involved in this case is the interpretation of the term “judgment creditor” as it is used in the Internal Revenue Code from Section 6323 and an interpretation of the powers given to the trustee under Section 70 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.749" offset="518353">The facts in this case are very simple and are not in dispute as they affect the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.150" offset="547924">On June 3, 1960, the District Director of Internal Revenue assessed withholding tax and interest in the amount of slightly more than $14,000 against the Kurtz Roofing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.659" offset="613961">On that same day, the District Director made demand for the taxes from taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.935" offset="643114">Seventeen days later on June 20, 1960, the Kurtz Roofing Company filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.313" offset="684596">Notice for the federal tax lien had not been filed prior to the date of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.684" offset="714062">The trustee rule that the United States was not a secured creditor and held that the United States was an unsecured claimant entitled only to the fourth priority of payment under Section 64 (a) (4) of the Bankruptcy Act for unsecured claims for taxes legally due and owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.708" offset="814164">As a result of this holding by the trustee, although other secured creditors were paid in full, the trustee proposed to pay on a pro rata dividend slightly over 53% on the federal tax claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.441" offset="889187">No amounts were distributed to the general creditors or the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.080" offset="919698">The Section 6323 of the Revenue Code of 1954 provides in part except as otherwise provided in subsection c.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.263" offset="968391">The lien imposed by Section 6321 shall not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed by the Secretary for his delegate.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.032" offset="1043519">Section 70 of the Bankruptcy Act provides in part subsection c, the trustee as to all property whether or not coming into a possession for control of the Court upon which a creditor of the bankrupt could have obtained a lien by legal or equitable proceedings at the time of the bankruptcy shall be deemed vested as of such date with all the rights, remedies, and powers of a creditor, then holding a lien thereon by such proceedings whether or not such a creditor actually exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.910" offset="1195029">The only issue involved in this case is whether the languages used in that Section 70 of the Bankruptcy Act makes the trustee a “judgment creditor” for purposes of Section 6323 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.311" offset="1380603">Now, we submit that in the interpreting Section 70 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.953" offset="1415189">There's -- there should be read in conjunction with the language that is used in Section 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.760" offset="1442461">Language that is used in Section 67 as it applies to federal taxes and other lien holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.170" offset="1480077">By its terms Section 67 allows statutory liens for tax and debts owing to the United States could be perfected after bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.103" offset="1527829">Section 67 states in part whereby such laws, such liens are required to be perfected and arise but are not perfected before bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.800" offset="1566595">They may nevertheless be valid if perfected within the time permitted by and in accordance with the requirements of such laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.411" offset="1600972">Now, under 67, there a number of other creditors besides tax liens holders, who may perfect their liens and they will take under the priority set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.716" offset="1670248">Now, it is difficult to believe that Congress intended federal taxes -- included federal taxes under Section 67 to go out and to be perfected and then what have repudiated that by saying in Section 70 using language that the courts withhold that the trustee was a “judgment creditor” because as the “judgment creditor” you can't perfect the taxes under the Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.342" offset="1784769">Now, to uphold the trustees' position in effect creates two categories of priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.908" offset="1823013">One, it would be in effect in a lien priority contest where there was no bankruptcy as many other cases were before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.807" offset="1862614">And a different priority in those cases where there is bankruptcy because Rule 67 allows a landlord, county, other lien holders to perfect their lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.170" offset="1920084">Under the holdings of this Court, those same lien holders cannot perfect their lien after the taxes have been assessed and you would have two sets of priorities then.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.634" offset="1969925">You would have the mechanics liens and the landlords, if there have been a bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.951" offset="1991137">They would leap frog the federal tax lien because of the status given the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.134" offset="2011930">Whereas in a straight lien priority contest not involving bankruptcy, the federal tax lien would come ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.158" offset="2044008">It is difficult to believe that Congress intended such a result.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Gosline</label>
            <text syncTime="1456.869" offset="5930820">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.123" offset="5943881">I think it might help the Court to understand this case if we start where the present appeal started and that is with the conflict between the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.892" offset="6010964">The statutes which we have here are two federal statutes and this case as we've argued it to the Court to the Sixth Circuit dealt with the meaning and relationship between these two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.102" offset="6091734">Now, Section 6323, Section 5321 creates what sometimes called the secret federal tax lien by assessment and demand on the taxpayer alone that is the completed perfected lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.003" offset="6159339">That lien, however, is by Section 6323 said to be not valid and it uses the word valid until notice is filed with a county recorder or a District Court depending upon where it is to be filed where the District Director desire to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.182" offset="6252126">So that after assessment and demand, the simple filing of a notice the next day, the same day, makes this lien valid not only against the debtor and most all unpreferred classes but also against these four preferred classes including the judgment creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.237" offset="6348361">Now, in this case, bankruptcy -- voluntary bankruptcy intervened between the time of the assessment and demand and later and I think superfluous filing of the notice with the county recorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.799" offset="6426520">So that the referee in bankruptcy relying upon the grant of Section 70 (c) said, that because by the same Act -- the same Congress which said a “judgment creditor” is entitled to freedom from the secret lien, also said, that a trustee in bankruptcy shall be deemed vested with the rights of -- with all the rights of a lien holder holding a lien by legal or equitable proceedings was by inclusion of that though general terms a “judgment creditor” and his right was not subject to the prior secret lien of the federal tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.669" offset="6638007">Now, the controversy, I think, arose from the controversy and the interpretation of Section 70 (c) and 6323 arose from a decision some years ago of this Court in the Gilbert Associates case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.850" offset="6694745">In that case, this Court was confronted with an interpretation of the phrase “judgment creditor” in 6323 and only that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.397" offset="6728913">The controversy was between the federal tax lien and a local tax lien in New Hampshire, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.842" offset="6766738">And this Court said, that “judgment creditor” means a person holding a judgment of a court of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.750" offset="6802369">Now, I don't think anyone can argue with that and we agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.376" offset="6828910">The next case, in order of time, would be Fidelity Tube Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.761" offset="6850435">That case was heard en banc and there was a majority opinion and a dissent and I think the division was something like four to two or five to two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.737" offset="6898291">But the principal -- the majority opinion said that in the Gilbert Associates case, the Supreme Court said, you have to have a judgment in a court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.182" offset="6952103">The trustee in bankruptcy does not have a judgment in the court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.929" offset="6967045">Therefore, the trustee in bankruptcy is not a judgment creditor within 6323.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.600" offset="6997765">In rather inconsistent situation -- discussion, the majority went on to say that Congress could amend this Section 70 (c) to say that a trustee in bankruptcy would be a “judgment creditor”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.822" offset="7066624">Now, the dissent in that case is a careful consideration of this question and in the dissent Judge Kalodner said, that a trustee in bankruptcy should not be considered a “judgment creditor” for one purpose and not for other purposes because Section 70 (c) is broad in its statement and said, that he shall have all the rights of a creditor holding a lien by legal or equitable proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.327" offset="7200684">He went on to say that the words of Section 70 (c) were general and broad enough to cover the elements which made up a ‘judgment creditor”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.101" offset="7255751">Certainly, a creditor holding a lien by judicial proceedings, as anyone would ordinarily interpret it, include the “judgment creditor”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.444" offset="7301099">He suggested in the majority or the majority opinion suggested that if Congress did amend the law to include a trustee in bankruptcy as a “judgment creditor”, it would solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.284" offset="7368495">Now, this is inconsistent with the original position that under the Gilbert Associates case, there can only be a “judgment creditor” who has judgment by a court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.779" offset="7422516">And I think that that is one of the keys to the efficiency in the Government position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.443" offset="7453132">They admit in their brief the Congress has the power to grant a trustee in bankruptcy the status of a “judgment creditor” but yet they say that only first holding a judgment in the court of law can have that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.420" offset="7521050">Those two are inconsistent and cannot be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.905" offset="7534947">They say leave it up to the Congress to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.266" offset="7552397">I think that that's not necessary because the Congress has already stated in the present 70 (c) which was decided -- which was amended in 1952 that a trustee in bankruptcy has these rights.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Gosline</label>
            <text syncTime="2202.165" offset="8912018">It's a broader language than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.531" offset="8921527">But otherwise, the trustee would be confronted with an unlimited possibility of filing and with an indeterminate situation in the bankruptcy administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.726" offset="8986311">I'll move back briefly to the opinion of the Sixth Circuit, that was written by Judge Sullivan and it states in very succinct and precise terms, the position on which we basically rely and that is that the Congress had the right to give this exemption to “judgment creditor”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.817" offset="9078680">The Congress also have the power to define who would be considered a “judgment creditor” and in Section 70 (c), Congress had given that definition and broaden up terms so that the trustee in bankruptcy as Judge Sullivan quote as clearly his words can state the trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to all of the rights of a “judgment creditor” although, obviously, he is not one and that language he quoted from the concurring opinion of Judge Hamley of the Ninth Circuit in the other conflict case of Simonson versus Granquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.984" offset="9263313">The Government has relied upon the committee report in recent years and I think it's appropriate to comment on those very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.118" offset="9307826">We have -- they have quoted committee reports of the House Ways and Means Committee and we have quoted committee report to the Senate Finance Committee of the committee report of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee which were dealing with Section 6323 and those committees are of course in favor of a strict construction of a “judgment creditor” in aid of the collection of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.819" offset="9422660">We have relied upon reports of the bankruptcy subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee and of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.268" offset="9452440">These reports are considering the status of the trustee and the efficiency of the operation of the bankruptcy procedures and they are in favor of expanding the rights of the bankruptcy trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.944" offset="9523179">These committee statements, I think, have to be somewhat of a stand off and the legislative history which has had in this statutes since about 1910, a provision that trustee and bankruptcy shall be considered as if you were a “judgment creditor” as well as the present form which grants to the trustee in bankruptcy rights well beyond those of a “judgment creditor” because in some states and in particular in Ohio, a “judgment creditor” is not a lien holder until a certificate of judgment is filed or until a levy of execution is filed, so that the rights of a “judgment creditor” in Ohio are substantially less than the rights of a creditor holding a lien by legal or equitable proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.848" offset="9734771">Government makes reference to the practical effect of the ruling and of the statute and makes the point that in this case, the Government was not treated as an unsecured creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.646" offset="9810004">And I think in that, he falls in the error of distinguishing between priority unsecured creditors and unsecured creditors which have no priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.468" offset="9853262">Now, state and federal taxes are given a priority over other unsecured creditors under 64 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.272" offset="9892446">The result is that in this case the Federal Government shared with the state taxing agencies in the dividend which was proposed, the 53% dividend, and that represents just exactly what the purpose of Section 70 (c) is and that is to bring the right of an unsecured creditor ahead of a creditor claiming a secret lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.667" offset="10046046">I think with respect to the practical effects, we always come down to the very simple answer, that the only thing that the Government has to do to protect itself completely in this type of situation is to file its notice and when that notice is filed mortgagees, pledgees, judgment creditors, trustee in bankruptcy are all subsequent in their priority to the federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.974" offset="10167254">I think, probably, the arguments in favor of trustees' position as the “judgment creditors” are fully summarized in Judge Sullivan's opinion, it is brief and it is precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.500" offset="10233396">They also summarized the memorandum of the referee in bankruptcy which is in the record and the word of the two statutes, I believe, are clear and unambiguous and don't require any resort to legislative history comparisons to practical effect or other collateral sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.775" offset="10318451">But proper construction is possible from a simple reading of their provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.483" offset="10337259">Perhaps the heart of the argument here is the power of Congress to define the word “judgment creditor” to include a trustee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.406" offset="10397027">We believe that the Government concedes this power, that this power was exercised in 70 (c) and 70 (c) defines the trustee as the statutory “judgment creditor”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.087" offset="10455751">With these reasons which are set out in the publications that are on file, we believe that the judgment of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals should properly be affirmed in preference to the conflict cases.</text>
