            <text syncTime="44.193" offset="280116">In this case Elmer Davis, the petitioner, contends that his petition for writ of the habeas corpus should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.674" offset="338108">This case has been in the litigation for nearly seven years and Elmer Davis, a 35, now 35, I believe he was about 29 when this case started, is in the state present at Riley on death row.</text>

            <text syncTime="94.362" offset="480841">That the only evidence that could possibly could link Davis with this murder is the confession, that's the only thing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.550" offset="525563">Now if you have notice on the record page 110, that he was arrested by the Charlotte police on September the 21, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.215" offset="592227">They went over there and arrested him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.853" offset="7726791">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.032" offset="7755525">Mr. Bell was been with this case all the way through and I got in on the very end of it, several members of our office having handled it previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.585" offset="7797739">The question before this Court is not a new question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.284" offset="7816547">However the ascertainment of the answer by placing all the facts of this case within the applicable law was enunciated by this Court, it's difficult as always, we realized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.569" offset="7865657">If I may add a personal note, the case is difficult for me there are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.505" offset="7889377">First, I do not approve of capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.761" offset="7906408">Second, it's the first case I have ever appeared in which the death sentence had been imposed and I was on this side of defense that I -- I've always been a defense counsel previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.380" offset="7964923">Now, the State of North Carolina and the Attorney General's Office is not vindictive, not blood thirsty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.571" offset="7997628">It has been our practice as Mr. Bell well knows during the years that I have been there that we concede error very frequently in criminal cases in both the State and the federal courts when there's been violation of due process or error of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.213" offset="8068263">Yet, I have a duty to the public of North Carolina and I have a profound respect for the law and we feel that when all of the circumstances of this case have been considered, that the decisions of the lower courts will be affirmed finding that there had not -- had not been a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.694" offset="8178186">Mr. Bell in response to your question, we did some of the history of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.172" offset="8200025">It has been a long case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.579" offset="8205667">It's been in litigation ever since 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.932" offset="8223117">The voluntariness of the confession was considered by the trial judge in the Superior Court and resolved against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.120" offset="8259897">The North Carolina Supreme Court resolved a question against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.149" offset="8283930">This Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.255" offset="8300440">It was Judge Butler the first time in the District Court in that circumstance, I was not within, found the facts against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.985" offset="8343280">It went to the Fourth Circuit and they felt that a plenary hearing should be held and a plenary was held in the United States District Court of the eastern district which was a trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.219" offset="8412244">In fact, every witness involved so far as this confession is concerned in material was heard by the District Court plus additional three witnesses who were not heard in the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.670" offset="8478072">And I might say that the State allowed Mr. Bell to lead his client and his witnesses anyway they wanted to go because we had no hesitation in letting the full facts come out in that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.559" offset="8549648">Now, we had not planned to argue the facts of this case in detail because we think that the findings of the District Court, the findings of the Fourth Circuit sufficiently deal with the facts and then prior to law thereto and it would be somewhat of a wasted time for us to review them again here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.114" offset="8663855">I would like to respond to what Mr. Bell said he felt had happened that this was a planned thing from the beginning when the police first took Davis into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.455" offset="8713174">It must be remembered that he was taken into custody in Belmont the night or the day after the murder and I see no way that the police could have planned anything against Davis because they didn't know who had committed the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.974" offset="8787257">Now, on Davis' person when he was arrested was a pocketbook, identification cards from Bishel Hayes whom he had robbed the day of the murder within a few yards of the cemetery where the murder occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.419" offset="8857057">Now that is why the Charlotte police went to Belmont and brought him back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.147" offset="8875969">The Belmont police contacted the Charlotte police as they always do when they pick up an escaped convict and let them know he has been apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.564" offset="8909615">In addition to that he had on this person various other articles which he had stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.759" offset="8934379">He had broken into homes and stolen ladies pants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.966" offset="8951202">He had stolen these items off on clotheslines on his trip down from the mountains coming in to Charlotte.</text>

            <text syncTime="2533.414" offset="10237053">However, all of the evidence that the Superior Court and the District Court indicates that this notation was completely disregarded by all of the police officers, in fact, they had no knowledge of it other than Captain McCall who said he may have had to put on there -- it would be explanation concerning to being a C grade prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.815" offset="10326601">Now, the reason -- the evidence shows that it was disregarded immediately after David was put into jail, I believe the next day the record indicates, he requested the jailer, I believe, to contact his sister by telephone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.774" offset="10862425">Now, all the officers say that she'd never once came to the City Jail to see Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.438" offset="10889174">She said that she did go over to the County Jail to see him at one time, but it's significant that she didn't even bother to go to his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.079" offset="10931702">It is further significant that neither Mr. Bell nor Mr. Avins or her attorneys nor the sister nor Davis considered this testimony germane enough to have at the trial or at any time until four years later at the plenary hearing in the District Court.</text>
