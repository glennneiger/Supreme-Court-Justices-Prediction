            <text syncTime="22.381" offset="193891">Amplifying my reply yesterday to the questions of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Harlan with regard to the so-called finding or declaration of Congress instead of an enactment with regard to the poll tax, the key to that I believe is readily found if the Court will permit me to read two brief excerpts from the hearing, the statement by the Attorney General in testifying before the House Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.993" offset="324399">Mr. Katzenbach said, “To eliminate poll taxes on the basis that they have very often have been used to discriminate, that is on Fifteenth Amendment, I think would be a difficult case constitutionally cruel and savage.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.847" offset="403811">This is 1972 hearing and QA, I think we would have a difficult job abolishing them on the Fifteenth Amendment basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. George D. Gibson</label>
            <text syncTime="106.605" offset="530766">In the Senate, Mr. Katzenbach testified, the President wanted to reduce the voting age to 18 and he was also extremely interested in the elimination of the poll tax in its entirety and wanted to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.598" offset="602760">He asked me, this is the Attorney General, whether in his prior days in Congress, he had been wrong in thinking that this could not be done by a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.597" offset="650825">I gave him the same advice that I've given the Committee here.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.345" offset="669738">I think if federal qualifications as such are to be set then it requires a constitutional amendment to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.356" offset="725849">And again from QA, Senator Erwin, “Therefore Mr. Attorney General, it would be unsafe to base a statute on the Fourteenth Amendment that is, would it not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="169.457" offset="782273">Mr. Katzenbach, “I think the power is derived from the Fifteenth Amendment and the effort in that other situation which was to provide a further justification of what was done because of prior violations under the Fourteenth Amendment, in my judgment Senator, that is a difficult argument to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.965" offset="860223">One, it is unnecessary and one that I think I would prefer were I ought to bring this case in the Supreme Court, not to have to make.”</text>
            <text syncTime="200.110" offset="904840">Senator Fong, “You feel then that it should be predicated only on the Fifteenth Amendment?”</text>
            <text syncTime="205.497" offset="926365">Attorney General Katzenbach, “Yes, I do Senator.”</text>
            <text syncTime="208.766" offset="939426">Senator Fong, “I think it does state, you did state that under the Fourteenth Amendment, you think Congress has the right by statute to eliminate the poll tax and I hear you say that in your opinion?”</text>
            <text syncTime="219.970" offset="984252">Attorney General, “Under the Fourteenth?”</text>
            <text syncTime="221.711" offset="991253">Senator, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="222.865" offset="995850">“No Senator, I do not think they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.023" offset="1016539">If the payment of poll tax is or the requirement for payment of poll tax in order to vote exists, I think that could be in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and that matter will be considered by the Supreme Court in its next term.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.583" offset="1074740">The Court has held in the past that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.175" offset="1085085">It is going to reexamine the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.984" offset="1096370">I do not see how a decision by Congress that it would be in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment would really add very much if anything to the argument if its already going to be make to the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="266.507" offset="1170453">Mr. Justice Fortas was asking me at the conclusion of the hearing yesterday with regard to the economic effects and whether it involved in economic terms, a discrimination as a result of the application of the poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.179" offset="1237117">All appellants joined in urging that such a discrimination does in fact result.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.804" offset="1263658">Appellant Butts emphasized that as involving a particular impingement upon the Negro because of a generally low level of income in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.530" offset="1306499">And indeed, it is true that the proportion of Negroes within the so-called poverty groups of this lower income levels is greater than a proportion of white people in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.010" offset="1360415">But in all honesty, we submit, that this objection is magnified beyond realism, admittedly if one has nothing, he cannot pay anything, but taxes of fixed amount have in -- continuously been imposed since the foundation of the Republic and in Virginia since the establishment of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.823" offset="1467726">And we all know that $1.50 is not a large sum and even within low levels of income is often spent for quite casual purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.245" offset="1517359">The Senator in the hearings that I referred to in a moment, the Chairman of the subcommittee said, "Anybody can pay a two-dollar poll tax" and Attorney General Katzenbach replied, “That is correct,” it's in page 194 of the Senate hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.325" offset="1593741">We really submit an objection based upon the payment of $1.50 is so insubstantial as to merit dismissal on that ground alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.259" offset="1645464">Moreover, as Ogden cited in argument by the appellants has found, the groups least able to pay a poll tax are also the ones least interested in voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.519" offset="1706486">It means that the incidence of the real prevention of voting because of the $1.50 requirement is very intriguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.374" offset="1741908">And if there be within that group, some people actually able and willing to vote and desirous of voting, but unable to pay $1.50, we submit to the Court that that is a situation of infrequent economies and it is not an ordinarily the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.875" offset="1823932">That the statute workable in its general operation would be defeated because of some incidental and exceptional accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.741" offset="1871370">Moreover, we submit it's quite misleading to suggest to this Court that the poll tax operates most extensively against the Negro race, while it is true as I said a moment ago, there is a larger proportion of the Negro race than White in lower income bracket.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.204" offset="1953186">We know quite well from Reynolds and Sims that votes are cast by people and not by mathematical fashion, but arithmetic proportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.276" offset="2001460">The facts are, that if there is any particular economic impingement resulting from $1.50 a year payment, it affects three to four times as many white people and nonwhite people in Virginia because that is exactly the ratio revealed by the census of the people within the law of so-called poverty levels of income among white citizens to the proportion -- to the number amongst nonwhite citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.134" offset="2268954">Mr. Justice Holmes said that it was not true that the power to tax is the power to destroy so long as this Court sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.236" offset="2301346">And Your Honors will find no difficulty in drawing lines between reasonable and traditional sense such as a $1.50 or $2.00 in other cases sustained by the Court and sensible figures that rarely impose objects (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="565.244" offset="2365398">And the reason when I asked you that question is that I understood from your argument yesterday that it was your theory that the state power, they would fix the qualifications of voters is not limited by questions of reasonableness or any other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.457" offset="2458185">I like to inquire this morning is really whether you think consistently with your view on this matter that the state power to levy a poll tax as a prerequisite for voting is limited by the reasonableness of the amount.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_d_gibson" startTime="609.373" stopTime="943.755">
            <label>Mr. George D. Gibson</label>
            <text syncTime="609.373" offset="2541881">By no means.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.354" offset="2545852">My basic premise at least Your Honor is that the right to vote in state elections is a state created right and may be given or withheld on such terms and conditions as the state may determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.580" offset="2610740">But subject to that, passing beyond and as a secondary argument, we submit that if a rule of reason is to govern action of the state, then at that point, it is reasonable to permit submit a poll tax of $1.50 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.080" offset="2688690">I've propose in this argument, without abandoning the former and on this basis, the sanctioning of poll tax of $1.50 a year would by no mean also, the poll tax of $150 a year or $15 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.118" offset="2784820">So we turn back and point, bear in mind that ratio of three or four whites to one nonwhite in Virginia of lower income level that the mere fact that a foreman maybe nonwhite in one out of three or four instances in Virginia does not indicate that a tax or fixed amount discriminates against a race anymore than a marriage license a fixed amount does or as was suggested yesterday from the bench, an automobile license or any of those charges that are fixed in amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.530" offset="2938525">It was also suggested from the bench that sales tax upon which that the Court knows, the revenues of most states have now come to rely are fixed in amount, yet I do not believe it's ever been suggested that they are unconstitutional on that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.933" offset="3012086">All taxes of that kind like the $1.50 herein take people as they are, races as they are, and are in the words of Lassiter, neutral on race, creed, color and sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.542" offset="3082616">And quite apart from the Fifteenth Amendment, if it were to be true under the Fourteenth Amendment that all taxes, for example, sales taxes would have to be proportioned to the ability to pay, obviously that the revolution infrastructure of the country would be a necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.562" offset="3166626">At the closing argument yesterday, I was just concluding the points asked, the administration of the poll tax has a rational and servicable usefulness in promoting the integrity of the ballot and an informed electorate in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.020" offset="3244471">The key to that is not merely in the payment of a $1.50 but $10.00 as Mr. General remarked, but doing so six months before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.724" offset="3299328">That as I said does not require a spot calculation of when an election is may be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.241" offset="3325346">It merely requires a payment of that amount by December 5 of every year then you're sure that you will be in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.778" offset="3379472">The reason for the six-month period is to be sure that people exit with regard to matters of state, that degree of attention and demonstrate that degree of competence that demonstrates a minimal capacity to deal with their own affair and hence had participated in the determination that they are the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.767" offset="3471423">That is the rationale disclosed, demonstrated in the testimony of the Chief Tax Commissioner of the state who has held that office for 39 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.796" offset="3515622">I draw a sharp distinction between an understanding test of these[Inaudible] test which is constitutionally accepted, what has this demonstration of legal [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="872.935" offset="3596184">That there's a conflict to be raised at least, on purely subjective basis before held in Louisiana subject to the [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="884.148" offset="3641010">While this in the words of [Inaudible] Tax Commissioner is as mechanical as tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.982" offset="3668281">Tax bills assess to all known persons and should, -- if they fail any instance, any person can submit his tax to the Commissioner of Revenue [Inaudible] thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.127" offset="3728886">In short, I should say Tax Commissioner said it is the simplest and most legal, nondiscriminatory and authentic test of minimum intelligence and responsibility that could be derived.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.333" offset="3781757">So under Lassiter, we submit that literacy and illiteracy are neutral on race, creed, color and sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.343" offset="3817806">This is a permissible criterion for the state to enact and as Your Honor said there, this Court does not sit in judgment on the wisdom of that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.948" offset="3860229">We cannot say it does not allow the one on the constitutional sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1118.173" offset="4577134">I was asked also about disfranchising Negroes as such and obviously that question is contended by the Fifteenth Amendment and so indelibly that it's typical to think the Constitution in terms exclusive of the Fifteenth Amendment like one who had a leg amputated on toe, they still feel still they have one and not [Inaudible] to believe that that allusion must be someway emotional, convinced that must be someway -- even though history says the opposite.</text>

            <text syncTime="1440.602" offset="5866851">Your Honors will recall, number one, it was property tax qualification, poll tax qualifications were in effect at the time of the adoption of the constitution, at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.466" offset="6034244">Since then, this Court in Breedlove against Suttles which is the argument yesterday I submit reveals to be squarely controlling sustained the Georgia poll tax in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.448" offset="6086175">After that, this Court again summarily sustained this specific Virginia poll tax in 1951.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.373" offset="6361924">I would like first to correct the record on one matter that was mentioned by counsel for the state yesterday in response to Mr. Justice Fortas' question as to whether state elections and federal elections are held at the same time in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.985" offset="6420334">I think the statements spoke on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.399" offset="6434022">There have been since 1964 when the Twenty-fourth Amendment became effective, there have been federal referendum questions on the ballot, at the same time, that the federal elections were held, elections for federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.458" offset="6498179">And in 1964 for example, when the presidential election was held, voters who had not paid the poll tax were eligible to vote in the federal election, but voters who wished to vote on the state referendum question which had given a constitutional amendment had to show that they had paid poll taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.957" offset="6568187">And this will happen again in this year for example, there are county elections, in some counties in the State of Virginia and these will also hopefully held on the same day in November that the elections will be held for United States' Senator and Congressmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.660" offset="6627015">There are -- I point out also elections that occur at different dates in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.217" offset="6645300">For example there would be municipal election the second Tuesday in June.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.922" offset="6664108">There were also -- there was a special elections held yesterday for example in the City of Alexandria, across the Riverport to fill a seat on the City Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.754" offset="6703397">So these elections are coming up all the time and every time -- everyday, the poll tax remains in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.455" offset="6726175">It continues to disenfranchise voters and people who would like to express their views on the governmental affairs in the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.339" offset="9373738">Before this convention -- the poll tax laws provided by this convention, Negroes held numerous state officers, including numerous seats in the governing body of Virginia, it's general assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.479" offset="9442283">Almost like a magic wand after the passage of this law, these poll tax laws not a single Negro has sat in the Virginia General Assembly, and not a single Negro has held a single elected state office in the state of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.941" offset="9528174">We say that the evil intent was accomplished and that it was accomplished in direct confrontation to the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.878" offset="9575926">We say that there is discrimination in Virginia which deprived Negroes of the right to vote, and we say that this is a direct violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.995" offset="9640396">The appellees state to you repeatedly that the administration of this law has been fair and equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.110" offset="9688879">But the point is, if you please, that every time a poll tax statement is made, there has been a carrying out of the act, the evil act of the Convention of 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.176" offset="9765052">Every time a poll tax payment has been collected, there has been a furthering of the discrimination caused, brought about rather, by the Convention of 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.254" offset="9821372">Every time the clerk of a court certifies a list of registered voters, it is furthering the discrimination of the constitutional Convention of 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.304" offset="9901620">By their own figures, 78,000 Negroes earned between $1900 per year in Virginia, by the appellees figure, that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.981" offset="10000363">By the appellees figures, 139,000 Negro citizens earned from $1 to $999 per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.130" offset="10052921">By their figures, 106,000 Negroes earned nothing in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.092" offset="10088761">These individuals have suffered the discrimination which again was perpetrated by the Convention of 1902.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.600" offset="10138812">What about the appellant?</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.473" offset="10158247">We say that this violation of her rights under the Fifteenth Amendment has now escalated and mushroomed unto a violation of her rights under the First Amendment for she is thereby deprived of the right of petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.514" offset="10250407">If we may, the appellant, Mrs. Butts presently lives in an area of the City Norfolk, Virginia which is affected or to be affected by redevelopment -- by redevelopment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.319" offset="10325640">She is unable by reason of what has occurred, by reason of the poll tax laws, she is unable to petition for redress of her condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.064" offset="10380601">She cannot change, cannot affect what is occurring to her because again of what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.664" offset="10423024">What Virginia accomplished by its action in 1902 was to create two body politics in Virginia, a White bodied-politic and a Negro bodied-politic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.321" offset="10493659">The Negroes have been effectively eliminated from any political power in Virginia, eliminated and separated from the political power which is now exercised by the Whites exclusively or to the exclusion of Negroes, excuse me.</text>
