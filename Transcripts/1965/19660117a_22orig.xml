            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Number 22 Original, State of South Carolina, Plaintiff, versus Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.708" offset="187204">Mr. Robinson.</text>

            <label>Mr. David W. Robinson, II</label>
            <text syncTime="21.446" offset="190130">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.853" offset="203818">This action was brought in the original jurisdiction of this Court to test the constitutionality of certain sections of the Voting Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.680" offset="243106">The complaint alleges -- 1965, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.164" offset="257003">The complaint alleges the passage of the Act, its application to South Carolina, the suspension of her literacy qualifications, certain of her voting records, voting history, the population characteristics of her people and something of her political characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.142" offset="352925">The answer for the most part denies the allegations of unconstitutionality of certain sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.381" offset="385944">This hearing is held pursuant to your order of November the 5th.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.056" offset="408618">At the outset, we would like to make two points clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.169" offset="425023">First, we do not here challenge the purpose of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.709" offset="447279">We believe that every man, white or black, who can -- who possesses the reasonable qualifications proscribed by State should be permitted to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.445" offset="490224">We further believe that Congress has a duty to enforce the prohibition against the infringement of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.162" offset="521049">Second, we do not attack most of the provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.013" offset="544455">The Act has broad remedial provisions which give courts tools to move in and stop discrimination in the use of literacy qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.278" offset="585519">We do not here questions though.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.835" offset="595759">Our attack is directed to some two and a half of the Act's 19 sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.419" offset="622090">Those sections which automatically suspend South Carolina's literacy test and freeze her legislative powers without any court hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.160" offset="669006">Secondly, these are Sections 4, 5 and 6 (b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.420" offset="698055">Secondly, whether you find those at pages 82 to 85 of the appendix our initial complaint was 4, 5 and 6 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="159.662" offset="743090">Secondly, we challenge the constitutionality of those criminal sections which make certain conduct criminal which is unrelated to state action and is unrelated to any discrimination on the grounds of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.350" offset="801813">Those are Sections 11 and 12 and you'll find those on page 91 and 92 of our complaint brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.464" offset="834205">We have grouped our argument into two parts, those reasons why these sections are not constitutionally appropriate and those reasons why these sections do not constitute legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.590" offset="902750">First, is to the appropriateness.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.045" offset="912572">This Act is grounded upon the Fifteenth Amendment, which requires that it'd be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.987" offset="940366">In acting under this amendment, Congress must legislate against the background of the entire constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.255" offset="977460">And we submit that if this Act violates fundamental rights secured under other provisions of the Constitution, or if it is an attempt to exercise powers which the Fifteenth Amendment does not bring, it cannot be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.146" offset="1040990">These sections we submit do both.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.312" offset="1053633">First, the Constitution as originally drawn, never gave Congress any powers to fix voter qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.054" offset="1092608">The sole permission and the power that Congress had in the Article 1, was to proscribe in connection with times, places and manners of federal elections, in effect the constitutions of each state were incorporated in the United States Constitution, insofar as voter qualifications are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.101" offset="1176827">There was no problem of the Supremacy Clause with respect to those qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.912" offset="1196053">Congress never had the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.264" offset="1205457">This is why the Fifteenth Amendment and the Nineteenth Amendment had to be amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.342" offset="1229803">Congress itself could not move into this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.626" offset="1242864">Before these amendments, there's no question but that literacy and similar property and other reasonable voter qualifications were perfectly legitimate and legal, and constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.731" offset="1295318">Now, we submit that the legislative history, the language of the amendment and the decisions of this Court today, showed that the Fifteenth Amendment gives Congress no power to suspend lawful reasonable voter qualification proscriptions of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.590" offset="1374730">The history of the Fifteenth Amendment you have before you in the appendix of the Virginia brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.865" offset="1391867">I would also call your attention to the new book, just to the Johns Hopkins press written by Mr. William Gillette, entitled The Right to Vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.699" offset="1427184">This is a Connecticut political history professor.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.979" offset="1444321">He's done a beautiful job.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.449" offset="1450172">These authorities clearly show that the authors of the Fifteenth Amendment considered and unequivocally rejected the idea of -- by the Fifteenth Amendment authorizing Congress to move into this area and proscribe or strike down voter qualifications, in connection with preventing racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.840" offset="1535749">Now, the specific language of the amendment is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.853" offset="1547766">The right to vote shall not be denied on account of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.978" offset="1564275">The power given to Congress is to impose these prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.770" offset="1583501">And I think this is the basic difference between my Brother and myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.179" offset="1601160">He contends that under this enforcement power, Congress has the right to anticipate a problem and move in and prevent that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.007" offset="1648389">Gentlemen, that is regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.996" offset="1660406">That is the power that Congress does have under the Interstate Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.220" offset="1677228">That's a plenary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.236" offset="1685379">Congress has all of the powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.124" offset="1692902">It surely under that power to regulate, in the Interstate Commerce Clause, it can anticipate a problem and meet that problem before it occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.722" offset="1727279">It's mindful of a city council with zoning laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.993" offset="1740340">The city council can proscribe for growth problems of a city through its zoning on it's will before they have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.270" offset="1769493">But gentlemen, this is the power to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.821" offset="1779628">The power of the Fifteenth Amendment is the power to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.053" offset="1796660">This is a power that the policeman has on the street corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.559" offset="1810662">Policeman cannot arrest me as a citizen because he thinks there's a danger that I'm going to commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.312" offset="1841695">This, you gentlemen have said over and over again, only so clearly in the demonstration cases, that crime must occur, the enforcement power, he cannot arrest me because I have a bad record.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.196" offset="1889134">He can only arrest me when I'm committing a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.595" offset="1902822">This is Congress' power to legislate under the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.205" offset="1921212">It is the power to prevent only what's prohibited, any law.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.944" offset="1940125">We are told that the reason for these trigger sections is that literacy test may be abused and a low vote indicates that they will be abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.479" offset="1978264">Any law gentlemen, any law administered by man is subject to abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.583" offset="1998744">The fact that these sections may be abused gives Congress no power to suspend under an enforcement power.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.317" offset="2041689">We submit that none of the defendant's authorities sustain as this is the (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="508.885" offset="2139909">He never charges us with that in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.192" offset="2149209">His whole brief is that the combination of these two factors indicates that it probably will have.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.542" offset="2170525">There's a danger, as I read his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.225" offset="2181287">This is the whole basis that he would sustain as legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.643" offset="2194975">This basic distinction was made by this Court in the civil rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.181" offset="2213157">Mr. Justice Bradley, and I call your attention to that case, particularly his language at pages 14 and 15 and 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.833" offset="2243772">Mr. Justice Bradley, the civil rights cases went into this difference between the power of Congress to regulate and a power of Congress to impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.703" offset="2279194">And he made it clear that under the Fourteenth Amendment which has the identical enforcement power, Congress could not move into this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.528" offset="2310541">We didn't put this case in our brief because we had no idea at the time we found that that this would be the basis of the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.884" offset="2339903">Finally, I would ask you to compare the differences between the sections that we attacked and those that we don't attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.193" offset="2365189">The sections that we don't attack are proper enforcement tight legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.792" offset="2383579">They'd given the courts the tool to move in and correct these situations where they occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.333" offset="2405731">The sections we attacked absolutely regulate, they suspend our literacy qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.462" offset="2430286">They paralyzed our legislature, we can pass no more laws in South Carolina dealing with elections, unless we come to Washington and get Washington's permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.552" offset="2466649">This is regulation, and this power, Congress does not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.143" offset="2484935">The only other present besides the Interstate Commerce Clause cases on which the defendant relies is Louisiana versus United States and I'd like to comment on that if I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.674" offset="2527044">In that case, the Court said that Louisiana adopted a new citizenship-type test for registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.966" offset="2560272">The Court said this was top or within the test that you've been applying.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.514" offset="2574482">You've got to give the same test to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.320" offset="2585663">You cannot let the new voters or make the new voters take this new test unless you make everybody take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.177" offset="2613144">So until you make everybody take it, we suspend it and leave it as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.739" offset="2631325">There was nothing wrong with the new test.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.299" offset="2637594">The Court didn't say that Louisiana couldn't have made everybody take this new test.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.001" offset="2656402">This is the same thing this Court said in the Grandfather clause cases, there's nothing new.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.407" offset="2674061">Everybody has got to take the same test, everybody got -- has the same qualifications, this is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.499" offset="2698407">South Carolina's test that its citizens be able to read and write only.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.179" offset="2717111">We don't need to have an English requirement, read and write.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.682" offset="2731112">This test has been on these books for 70 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.043" offset="2744592">We require re-registration every ten years, to make sure that if one guy slipped through ten years ago presumably, there'd be new administrators in ten years, he'll have to take it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.672" offset="13815077">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.521" offset="13826466">As an Assistant Attorney General of Virginia, I appear as one of the counsel for the Commonwealth amicus curiae in support of the positions taken by the State of South Carolina in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.194" offset="13873173">Specifically, the Commonwealth endorsed these two of the positions taken by the State of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.659" offset="13895011">First, the invalidity of the 50% formula provisions which governed the applicability of the Act; and secondly, the invalidity of the substantive provisions of the Act which abolished even racially nondiscriminatory literacy tests in the various States covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.028" offset="13968468">Now, various aspects of South Carolina's position had been endorsed by different counsel from different other States which have supported the plaintiff in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.648" offset="14002949">And then an effort to prevent duplication of argument, we have undertaken to apportion certain of the aspects of South Carolina's position for different emphasis by different counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.238" offset="14057388">It is to the second contention of South Carolina which we support that I withdraw the Court's attention in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.748" offset="14087377">Particularly to what we believed to be the central and controlling issue in the case at bar, namely, the scope of the power conferred upon Congress by the Fifteenth Amendment as indicated by the legislative history of the framing and the adoption of that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.086" offset="14160729">In this connection, counsel for Virginia take the position that any impartial analysis of that legislative history will demonstrate beyond (Inuadible) that no power was conferred upon Congress by that amendment to alter, amend, suspend or abolish the literacy test requirement of any State or any other educational qualification placed upon the right to vote by any State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.966" offset="14288311">And also, that the Framers of that amendment on three separate occasions by recorded vote specifically rejected attempts to insert in the Fifteenth Amendment just such a power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.608" offset="14354871">As a result, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 constitutes in our view nothing more than an attempt by Congress to assert by legislation a power which was specifically denied in the constitutional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.918" offset="14424043">As approval to a consideration of this contention, we should like to note the Government's concurrence in at least one aspect of our position and our concurrence in one aspect of the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.151" offset="14473049">This is embodied in two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.271" offset="14481512">The opening two sentences of the Government's brief in its initial argument on page 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.386" offset="14505963">The Government says this, “In enacting the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Congress was unmistakably invoking its powers under the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.557" offset="14542639">Whether it exceeded those powers and invaded rights reserved to the States as South Carolina contends, must be determined from an analysis of the scope of a grant and the nature of the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4085.364" offset="16445816">He was in Congress at all times during the debate on the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth Amendment and he pointed out as clearly as could be that under the Fifteenth Amendment as proposed by the House Judiciary Committee, it would be perfectly competent for the States to disfranchise any and all classes of citizens they may wish to do so provided they did so with a literacy test or a property qualification applicable to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.970" offset="16564308">On this point, Mr. Bingham said and we have set it out on page 4 of our appendix, these three items, race, color and previous condition of servitude are the only terms of limitation in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4198.694" offset="16899197">I think this is true, Mr. Chief Justice, without knowing specifically about the existence of the laws to which you refer because those who objected to the limited form of the Fifteenth Amendment pointed out that for years, both southern and northern states had deprived the Negro of education, had robbed him of his property and that therefore, he had been reduced to this condition and yet he could still be disfranchised for want of education, want of literacy and want of property even though his status in both northern and southern states was due to the manner in which he had been treated for two centuries in this country, yet he could still be disfranchised by a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.987" offset="17076308">And Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts said, in effect, this makes no difference if the qualification, education, literacy or property is one which is attainable, if it is within the reach of a well-directed effort by colored citizens or by Orientals who were the chief concern of the senators from the West Coast, then it is a proper qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.170" offset="17165124">And despite the fact, that the condition of the Negro in this country had been brought about as the radical republican said by the activities of the white citizen both in the north and the south, yet under this limited amendment they could be disfranchised by a literacy test which applied equally to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.334" offset="17245686">And that was the purpose or the specific ground of their opposition to the limited Fifteenth Amendment, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.269" offset="17273480">They proposed instead, both Mr. Bingham and Mr. Shellabarger, the universal manhood suffrage proposition, which would have said that no state should deny to any male citizen, 21 years of age or upward and of sound mind, the right to vote if he has resided in the State for one year under Mr. Bingham's proposal, under Mr. Shellabarger's proposal if he has resided in the State for the length of time prescribed by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.276" offset="17381522">Now these propositions were voted down by more than two to one vote in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.135" offset="17408899">And the proposition to insert in the Fifteenth Amendment, in addition to race, color and previous condition of servitude, property and education was also voted down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.893" offset="17463965">And thereafter, the House passed the Fifteenth Amendment in the form in which we now find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.062" offset="17492595">If they -- and the Senate opened on this resolution as settled from the House, and once again, objection was made to it and it was castigated on all side by those who said, under it -- the southern states as well as the northern states may disfranchise any people they wish, any class of people, by use of a property qualification or an educational qualification so far -- so long as it applies equally to all who make application to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.142" offset="17621013">Mr. Warner and Mr. Morton, or Senator Warner and Senator Morton, both republicans, made the same type of statements that Mr. Bingham, Congressman Bingham and Congressman Shellabarger had made in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.162" offset="17669078">Mr. Warner's statement is especially forceful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.262" offset="17681408">It set on page 8 of the appendix, it is to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.528" offset="17698544">The animus of this amendment is a desire to protect and enfranchise the colored citizens of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.793" offset="17723517">Yet, under it and without any violation of its letter or spirit, nine-tenths of them might be prevented from voting and holding office by the requirement on the part of the States or of the United States of an intelligence or property qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.883" offset="17795929">The objection to the limited amendment was that it would not protect anyone from the requirement of a state prescribed literacy test, property test, nativity test, religious test or any other test, so long as it was not race, color or previous condition of servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.762" offset="17871475">This limited scope of the amendment so angered Senator Wilson of Massachusetts that he proposed an amendment which would have added to the specific grounds banned by the Fifteenth Amendment, not only race, color and previous condition of servitude but also nativity, property, education and creed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.023" offset="17968441">He proposed an amendment to the House version which would have added these four specific realms as grounds upon which a state might not disfranchise its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.606" offset="18014835">This proposition actually carried in the Senate and that version in which -- which would have authorized Congress to pass legislation enforcing a ban against literacy and educational qualifications was sent from the Senate to the House.</text>

            <text syncTime="5520.729" offset="22187321">But then when he makes this action which puts the trigger to work, now there is some thought by some people that in four -- in the other sections of the Act that a state could come to the District of Columbia as Mr. Robinson mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="5647.095" offset="22692739">Now, we stipulated the Government and the State of Louisiana, rather the Attorney General of Louisiana, I'm the defendant in that suit and Attorney General Katzenbach is the defendant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.267" offset="22741431">But we'd determined -- the parties determined that Louisiana did maintain a test or device in a stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.558" offset="22766613">And it was readily admitted that more than 50% of the persons of voting age residing in Louisiana were registered on November 1st, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.073" offset="22800677">And we have stipulations to that effect in the record in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5677.995" offset="22816350">The Director of the Census, however, determined that that applied to Louisiana because less than 50% of the voting age resided -- residing in Louisiana voted in the presidential election of November 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.457" offset="22870267">Now, in making that determination, the Director of the Census determined that on November 1st, 1964, Louisiana's adult population was a 1,000,893 persons and that 896 persons voted for president in the presidential election on November 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.893" offset="22932020">This was also stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.251" offset="22941424">Louisiana's voting percentage in that election, therefore according to that formula was 47.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.149" offset="22969010">Now, we proved in this case that the Director of Census was entirely erroneous, because 942,226 persons actually voted in the presidential election of 1964, but there were 45,963 persons that voted in the election that did not cast a vote for presidential counting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.518" offset="23058453">Now, I say that that's an absurd conclusion which this Act does not authorize because it says, voted in a presidential election, it doesn't say that you have to vote for president.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.168" offset="23093039">It doesn't say you have to vote for vice-president, it just said voted in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.273" offset="23121460">And there were 45,900 people who didn't choose to vote for a presidential candidate but voted for senator, congressman or whatever was up for election in the general election of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="5765.944" offset="23168167">So -- and this formula that I'm giving to you here applies to all the States in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.441" offset="23198156">But in determining the number of persons of voting age residing in Louisiana on November 1st, the Bureau of Census included adult military personnel stationed in Louisiana who actually were from other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.360" offset="23245803">He also included convicted felons confined and at large on that date who are not restored to the right of suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5792.398" offset="23274015">And he also included persons in past prisons and inmates charged with executions who cannot vote if they so incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.812" offset="23311632">On November 1st, there were 3200 persons confined to our state penitentiary, who had lost the right of franchise of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="5809.457" offset="23342247">There were 5093 adult convicted felons on parole or probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.234" offset="23361369">There were 50,000 convicted felons roaming around Louisiana who hadn't been restored to citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.226" offset="23389268">And of course, we prove this in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.019" offset="23400448">Now, in November the 3rd, 1964, in addition to the above persons in the penitentiary and so forth, there were 2338 persons confined in parish prisons throughout the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5836.197" offset="23449140">There were 8539 persons who are inmates in state charitable institutions, not including charity hospital in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.191" offset="23489160">There were 18,000 Louisiana persons serving in the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.553" offset="23506610">And there were 31,000 military personnel from outside the State stationed in military post in Louisiana, and that of course is in the record in that lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.676" offset="23543077">On November the 1st, 1964, there were 312,000 or so illiterates ineligible to vote in Louisiana and we passed a constitutional amendment in 1960 which prevented the illiterates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5870.811" offset="23587589">But at the time we froze on to the rules, those illiterates who were then registered and it's interesting to note that we froze in on the registration rules over 20,000 white illiterates and over 13,764 Negro illiterates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.758" offset="23663449">So there were 44,000 persons, therefore, in Louisiana not possessing the necessary residential requirements for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5897.908" offset="23696050">And there were 20,101 females, to use an expression from Shakespeare, bastardizing females who were ineligible to vote because under our law and under our Constitution, unwed mother with bastard child is ineligible to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5916.500" offset="23770446">There were 29,400 persons convicted of misdemeanors and who are ineligible to vote for a short period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.825" offset="23803674">Now, the Voting Rights Act contemplates registration in voting and necessarily speak only of persons eligible to register the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5933.450" offset="23838156">And when this Act, of course the persons of voting age residing in Louisiana, it obviously means persons eligible to vote under Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.092" offset="23872742">In two other places in the Act between qualifications prescribed by state law is referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5948.829" offset="23899700">Coming back to my statistics, there were 31,000 persons serving in the Armed Forces stationed in Louisiana on November 1st, 1964 but there were only 18,000 citizens of Louisiana who were serving in the Armed Forces in Louisiana and all over the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.765" offset="23959468">According to the Department of Justice, now that the proper votes has been counted, Louisiana voted 49.5 of the population as determined by the Director of Census.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.760" offset="24003459">And this is a record in the suit I'm speaking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.075" offset="24016729">Louisiana missed voting 50% by 4000 votes according to the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5983.402" offset="24038045">Now, I submit -- I submit that if a number of Armed Forces personnel were corrected, if the felons who couldn't vote for our county, if those in charitable hospitals were considered, and if any of these factors were determined according to the true facts, which we submit the Department of Justice and the Census Bureau did not determine, then Louisiana voted far in excess of 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.692" offset="24135116">In fact we had a demographer of Tulane University who we'd qualify as an expert, testified that it was in excess of 70% that voted in the presidential election of November 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.650" offset="24191018">Now, the Attorney General, I'm sure in all sincerity told the Congress that the number of the Armed Forces personnel outside the state, those serving inside the state would not affect the percentage of adult persons voting in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6033.692" offset="24239188">And therefore, there was no need to amend the bill or to delete these persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.048" offset="24256637">And of course, the reasons that the Attorney General told Congress this, was because he was unaware at that time of the fact that the Bureau of the Census had miscalculated the vote in Louisiana by over some 45,963 persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="6353.131" offset="25516889">Our judicial process as Mr. Robinson pointed out had been stopped as a result of this triggering clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6358.854" offset="25539772">We, in Louisiana, if we wanted to say now that all persons in Louisiana who 18 years of age would be eligible to vote, we wanted to pass a constitutional amendment to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6369.757" offset="25583449">We have to come to the Attorney General and say, “Mr. Attorney General is this alright?”</text>

            <text syncTime="6381.495" offset="25630365">And then if the court approved that, then you could go back to Louisiana and pass your legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.865" offset="25651890">I think that that's totally inconsistent with our Constitution because I don't think Congress ever intended that the right to regulate elections would be taken away from the various legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6397.324" offset="25693686">And I submit again, that this only happens to the few States who were caught in the trigger, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6408.315" offset="25737676">And I don't think that this Act was adopted by happenstance let's say.</text>
            <text syncTime="6414.181" offset="25761081">The Attorney General quite frankly conceded during the hearings that if this trigger formula hasn't worked out to catch those that he knew were discriminated that he had device some other system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.812" offset="25803609">That's in the record, so that was evidently an obvious attempt on the part of Congress to get these particular States that the claimed was discriminating.</text>

            <text syncTime="6511.904" offset="26151978">That's what courts have thought under our system of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.704" offset="26171204">There was never any intent on the Framers of our Constitution on anybody, to just turn over or overturn it to the Attorney General the discretion of running registrar's offices in the various States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6527.769" offset="26215508">Now, let me give you just a little example of how far that's gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.445" offset="26230136">Just the other day, Mr. Doar wrote me a letter by which the Attorney General of the United States had set out to all of the registrars in my parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.024" offset="26272455">And it's a very nice letter and it goes on down here and it says, compliance has been fine, everything is going long good, everybody's happy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.598" offset="26306832">Then he says, number one, have all practices which delayed to discourage the registrations that abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6555.885" offset="26327939">And then a new practice has been adopted which tend to discourage registration of potential voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6560.769" offset="26347478">Now, as a registrar, he would determine who a potential voter is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.391" offset="26362002">What identification requirements are being used?</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.656" offset="26370988">Are the procedures being used more onerous than those which were used in registration of white citizens in the past?</text>
            <text syncTime="6572.859" offset="26395857">Are citizens who seek to qualify to vote being treated fairly and courteously?</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.124" offset="26412889">What law says that the registrars got to be courteous to anybody?</text>
            <text syncTime="6581.221" offset="26429294">He says, he's got to be fast, sure in registration but I don't have to say good morning, how are you doing, anything like that when I come in to register to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6589.294" offset="26461581">But the Attorney General wants my registrars to do that, then we've come down here a little further and he says, finally in conducting registration, it makes good sense to be open during longer hours or during some evenings or on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="6604.607" offset="26522812">Our legislature prescribes the time that the registrar's office will be open and where it would be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="6610.635" offset="26546949">And that's been upheld in the case of United -- I forget the title, but the Gallinghouse case, Judge Elis in the eastern district who since retired said that the registrar has got to file a state law and he's got to conduct his office of registration where the law provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="6625.754" offset="26607449">Namely, the county ceded the facts in which this case is New Orleans which I understand everybody in which it's got a beautiful setup down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.563" offset="26638691">And then he goes on, to be open during long hours or during some evenings or on Saturday or to employ extra place.</text>
            <text syncTime="6640.751" offset="26667426">Now, here as the Attorney General of the United States telling us we've got to hire extra place, appropriations for this matter, comes from the police juries or the Board of Supervisors, whose going to pay for that?</text>
            <text syncTime="6650.731" offset="26707341">But to hold registrations in each polling places and each municipality, then I believe you should do so, if that's not a clear mandate from the Attorney General to tell our registrars how to operate their office and how to operate and operate in contrary to Louisiana law, which we can't change unless we come up here to the District of Columbia and voluntarily bring our witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6670.765" offset="26787485">If a witness doesn't want to come, we can't make him come because this is more than a 100 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="6675.112" offset="26804830">So I said, when you considered all these States, you considered this triggering clause that the particular States involved were pit out because they wanted to put all these people, everybody on the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="6689.063" offset="26860628">Let me show you a little something here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6691.118" offset="26868882">California's got a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="6694.030" offset="26880481">They got over half a million illiterates in California possibly because they got more people than any State in the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="6701.197" offset="26909215">And these people can't vote in California but they can vote in Louisiana under this Act or they're being discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="6709.196" offset="26941189">And this Act doesn't help them because the date of the formula is November 1st or the presidential election of 1964, that's the cut-off date.</text>
            <text syncTime="6719.094" offset="26980791">Those that are not affected, Massachusetts' interveners in amicus curiae and so as New Jersey and several other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6726.049" offset="27008585">They're not affected by this Act, how can it concern them?</text>
            <text syncTime="6729.670" offset="27023109">What's their interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="6731.140" offset="27028961">They have no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6731.869" offset="27031886">It doesn't apply to them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6733.981" offset="27040350">Let's take Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.463" offset="27046201">Idaho is (Inaudible) on illiterate ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="6740.782" offset="27067517">He can't vote up in Idaho because of this formula because of this triggering clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.027" offset="27084549">That he could come to Louisiana and after serving the requirement of that time, he can vote in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6750.097" offset="27104820">That's why we say it's an act of discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6752.763" offset="27115478">That that was the standard that doesn't apply to everybody and actually discriminating because the only people affected, the only people would ever do it is five or six States involved and of course the last would just have to get caught within that and some couple of county didn't in Maine and Arizona and Idaho, just happened to get caught that they would like to vote -- the people of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="6777.576" offset="27214744">Now, I say to Your Honor that five years from our time is awful good.</text>
            <text syncTime="6782.119" offset="27232820">I think it's an issue of special legislation and that this legislation which already existed by act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6791.978" offset="27272317">Here, we have nothing but shortcut to make it go faster, faster and faster and faster.</text>
            <text syncTime="6799.183" offset="27301157">Without a resort to the Congress for registration procedures, without the result in the court being conventional or arbitrary over this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.751" offset="27351416">This is not only to decide in which -- which essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="6815.921" offset="27368030">Let me tell you something by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6818.449" offset="27378166">Do you criticize us when you hear a lot of crimes, you had the right to criticize, you're wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6823.709" offset="27399272">But I have great faith in this Court because I believe that in the final hour, this Court's wanted to do its duty and this Court is going to find that Congress cannot take over the judiciary which he's doing in this particular legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6840.133" offset="27464892">And no one can say as we said in our brief that you've been dragging your feet because you haven't done it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Attorney</label>
            <text syncTime="6906.774" offset="27731446">Chief Justice, may the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="6911.698" offset="27751194">It's a privilege to be here -- here and what I conceived that these rights side of litigation over an Act which will deeply affect the fundamental rights of the government, the State, the individual level and which if allowed to stand is the ultimate destruction of our Constitution and to our dear government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6935.244" offset="27845339">I also like to show the sanctions of our brief under the Supreme Court rules to this Court define for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6948.041" offset="27896539">Isaac Walton once said that doubtless God could make a better berry, and a strawberry, doubtless God had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6960.247" offset="27945336">Today, I can say that doubtless, Congress could enact worse legislation in the Voting Rights Act but doubtless Congress had never enacted anything more flagrantly on the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6976.146" offset="28008970">Our argument relates to the denial of free access to the court, the invasion and denial of equality of people and unlawful delegation of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6988.553" offset="28058603">Section 14 (b) of the Act, restrict suits for declaratory judgments and injunctions against the execution or enforcement of the Act solely to the District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="7002.116" offset="28112833">Under Section 5 of the Act, no legislative changes before the qualifications of statutes in an affected state maybe effective until permitted by judgment of the District Court of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="7018.967" offset="28180229">In effect, the states, individual voters, the rights or debates are diluted; election officials and others are denied free and reasonable access to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.184" offset="28229130">Free access is obviously denied and that all litigation must proceed to one judicial courtroom, just to elaborate tort condition to rest doesn't mean it's an ingress or egress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7042.973" offset="28276255">In our case, the congressionally conditioned States have got a one shot access to enjoin improper enforcement of the Act or to obtain declaration of the unconstitutional applications of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7058.912" offset="28339994">Although the statute Article III Section 2 of the Constitution giving this Court the racial jurisdictions of certain actions, save this Act from its unconstitutional deprivation of access to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7073.880" offset="28399867">There are many individuals, particularly States, election individuals who are personally vitally concerned with the current meaning, application of the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act in these many aspects, yet for instance in Alabama, you may need to travel 800 miles or more, Choctaw County for the District of Columbia, as has been said, without the power, to subpoena witnesses for more than 100 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="7103.102" offset="28516791">It's even to elaborate upon the expense of the burden, and practically impossibility of obtaining free prompt or effects of justice under said conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7114.496" offset="28562348">This is drastic and despotic legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7118.106" offset="28576872">It gives no reasonable opportunity to be heard to prevent and/or to present evidence and it's not in the clause with both “fundamental principles of liberty and justice” that Mr. Justice Black has said “lies at the base of our civil and political institution”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7140.848" offset="28667779">If the Congress can validly designate one Article III federal courts to handle the litigation to this Act or any other Act, it can designate any Article III federal court with the invalidity of the Act has been more or less apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="7157.653" offset="28734966">If Congress had designated the District Court -- a District Court in the State of Hawaii instead of the District Court here in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="7170.253" offset="28785434">The effective -- the effect of the restrictive provisions is to say among other things that a state statute cannot become effective until approved by federal court with a specifically named federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7184.178" offset="28841127">Thus, such court has made a part of the State's law making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="7189.423" offset="28862130">This is certainly not within the grant of any provision of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7195.837" offset="28887730">We are familiar with the legislative contention made by the defendant and this relies on the cases relative to emergency price control legislation in World War II, the rationale of those cases are based on a great factual jeopardy and as much as the earlier legislation was admittedly of a temporary nature to meet war time crisis, while the Voting Rights Act is permanent and no nationwide voting crisis exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="7224.317" offset="29001624">We -- this contention put -- in this contention, I think that the words of Mr. Justice Rutledge, the Court will bear with me in the case of Yakus versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7238.913" offset="29060033">There's forceful or forceful and most applicable to the first case in view of the absolute prohibition against any court to say that of the District of Columbia going into the validity of the various unconstitutional provisions of the Act so far as the States and the citizens of a state and the state election official is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7260.712" offset="29147282">He said, “Nor has it been held that Congress can forbid a court vested with a judicial power under Article III to consider this question and called upon to give effect to a statutory or the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7284.401" offset="29241950">It is one thing for Congress to withhold jurisdiction, it is entirely another to confer it and direct that it be exercised in a manner, inconsistent with constitutional requirements or what in some instances may be the same thing without regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7302.828" offset="29315720">Once it is held that Congress can require the courts criminally to enforce the unconstitutional law of the statutes including regulations or to do so without regard to their validity, their way will have been found to circumvent the supreme law and what is more, to make the court's parties in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="7322.133" offset="29392938">Whenever the judicial power is called into authority, it is responsible directly to the fundamental law and no other authority can intervene, force or authorize the judicial body to disregard it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7338.524" offset="29458453">That's 88 Law, Edition 834 United States versus Yakus.</text>
            <text syncTime="7344.787" offset="29483530">In the time of Magna Carta, we believe that has been a judicially accepted principle in the English speaking world that every litigant ought to be able to obtain justice completely, properly and without being obliged to purchase it as recently affirmed by this Court in Gideon versus Wainwright, of course that's an impossibility when you have to travel this many hundreds or thousands of miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="7369.358" offset="29581855">And because of that already, the suit has been denied access to the courts under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7374.446" offset="29602231">For example the registrars of Montgomery County, Alabama to say nothing of similar results and in other cases and in other base where the courts have said, because of 14 (b) we can't touch your contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="7389.093" offset="29660745">Yet of course, the Government has the opportunity to proceed in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7398.373" offset="29697839">In other words, we say that Congress cannot fall or restrict the power of the judiciary to determine, interpret and apply the law through the guise of merely restricting venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7412.693" offset="29755204">The doctrine of separation of powers and the inevitable lack of due process resulting from such onerous restriction we think forbid.</text>
            <text syncTime="7422.894" offset="29795955">Now, with respect to the equality of statehood which have been touched upon by various attorneys preceding me and by some members of the Court, I think Article IV Section 3 has involved the present situation, not historically repetitive of the legal constitutional turmoil in the United States as 1850's and 1860's were highly analogous.</text>
            <text syncTime="7457.789" offset="29935553">That time, those were administered to Federal Government, prompted by the parties and spirit in prejudice had become so strong, they were no longer willing to be bound by the ligaments of our written Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7471.722" offset="29991246">And Coyle versus Smith, this Court asked the question, “Can a state be placed upon the claim of equal -- inequality with its sister states in the Union if the Congress chooses to impose conditions which so operate at the time of its admission?”</text>
            <text syncTime="7491.419" offset="30070032">The Court answered its own question by saying, “Although that is Illinois admission, he at once became entitled to and possessed all the rights of dominion and sovereignty which belonged to their original states.</text>
            <text syncTime="7508.267" offset="30137428">She was admitted and could be admitted only on the same footing with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7513.917" offset="30160102">Equality of constitutional rights and power is the condition of all the States of the Union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7525.448" offset="30206182">If it was unconstitutional to deprive a state of a sovereign power on an attribute of equality as a condition or restriction and the conditional act of admission, then a fortiori that such a deprivation by Congress cannot be sanctioned or upheld to legislation fast long subsequent through the State's admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7548.765" offset="30299491">The Act which admitted Louisiana for instance provides he be admitted “on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7560.262" offset="30345467">It is not the mere assertion of her equality in this clause which is that is her equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="7567.570" offset="30374724">It only pronounces that equality which the Constitution establishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7573.192" offset="30397189">If she'd be equal, however, she must be equally exempt from the legislation of Congress past or future as are elder States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7582.714" offset="30435224">That's Permoli versus New Orleans, 3 Howard, 589.</text>
            <text syncTime="7591.652" offset="30470959">The congressional clause inserted in the acts of admission relating to perpetual freedom of navigable waters as common highways was never held to restrain to -- in any degrees of full power of the State even if the exercise of state power resulted in obstructions and impediments to navigation, that's in Willamette Iron Bridge Company versus Hatch, 125 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="7615.557" offset="30566672">One, “The right of Alabama and every other new States to exercise all the powers of government which belong to and may be exercised by the original States of the Union must be admitted and remained unquestioned except so far as they have temporarily deprived the control over the public lands, from Pollard versus Hagan, 44 U.S. 212 and this Court further emphasized that proposition in the and Escanaba versus City of Chicago when it held equality of constitutional right and power is the conviction of all the States of the union old and new.</text>
            <text syncTime="7653.430" offset="30718077">The equal footing clause prevents extension of the sovereignty of the State and to a domain of political and sovereign power of the United States from which the other States have been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="7664.393" offset="30761963">Just as it prevents a contraction of sovereign, that is state sovereignty which would produce inequality among the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7671.478" offset="30790280">For equality of States means that they are not less or greater or differed in dignity or power, that in U.S. versus Texas, 339 U.S.707.</text>
            <text syncTime="7683.152" offset="30836987">The freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly, association, and petition are protected as immune from state invasion by the First and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7693.743" offset="30879410">I believe that perhaps so in Gideon versus Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="7697.333" offset="30893725">So conversely, a preexisting and fundamental attribute of sovereignty of the States that is the regulation of the elective franchise is immune from federal invasion transaction, diminution or destruction by the Ninth and Tenth Amendment as well as by the doctrine of equality of statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="7717.565" offset="30974704">The negative constitutional proscription against state denial or abridgement of the right to vote by reason of race or color partly creates an affirmative federal power to setup a system of federal elected franchise with any State interrogation, if not destruction of an electoral procedure, not discriminatory upon its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="7741.478" offset="31070312">And thereby, deprive such State of its constitutional equality of political sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="7747.585" offset="31094763">As I recall only by the Reconstruction Act which I think in one of the decisions of this Court was declared unconstitutional, has Congress ever free this, they attempted to setup an elective franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="7761.245" offset="31149411">It is interesting to compare, therefore the voting qualifications in that Act to those of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7767.980" offset="31176265">As a former, it seems have served as a suggestive model for this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7773.288" offset="31197581">The qualifications of the Reconstruction Acts are that the voter would be 21 years of age and upwards that he'd be a resident of the State for one year previous to the elections and it excludes those who participated in the rebellion or who committed felonies at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7793.235" offset="31277307">We view -- I'll mention later as to how that is being applied in the present day and under the present Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7805.215" offset="31325268">We find that in the application of the Voting Rights Act in Alabama that is practically the rules, the qualifications, the criteria that's being followed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="7818.446" offset="31378139">Congress, as we must remember has assumed the protection of voters and their right of franchise vis-à-vis state laws that is under the Fifteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, and has assumed the protection of the application of these law as this Court had properly held Congress may do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7841.671" offset="31471031">It has done so in many ways and more recently through enactment of the various Civil Rights Act and supplementary legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7850.222" offset="31505304">And in respect thereof, it has been frequently held that this Court, the Government is not included from evading and correcting any impediments or discriminations by anything, the States or individuals, by state authority to do in violation of the congressionally enacted prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7871.801" offset="31591612">The Voting Rights Act at its very time goes far beyond the protective regulations of the Civil Rights Acts by actually asserting its power to outlaw and suspend and I say destroy because the power to suspend is the power to destroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7891.669" offset="31671024">If you can suspend for five years, you may be able to suspend for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="7897.659" offset="31695057">That is by actually asserting a power to outlaw and destroy an existing elected franchise and to create and install in lieu thereof federal criteria qualifications and procedures for voting even in local and state election, never before the judgment in that court, the facts and substance this Act does and this without making it uniformly applicable to all the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7923.635" offset="31798920">Uniformity, however, could only cure this one defect of Constitution -- of unconstitutionality or defect of constitutional inequality of statehood and would by no means cure what I call a vindictive act of its many other constitutional defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="7944.311" offset="31881676">The destruction of equality, sovereignty of seven entire states, we submit, is a far more calamitous political crime than is their alleged passed discriminatory depravation of individual political rights in a few counties of a few of the 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="7967.466" offset="31974254">Other States remain free to regulate fair franchise to have that pass or to enact new laws without the crippling conditions imposed by the Voting Rights Act upon Alabama and the other affected States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7985.975" offset="32048337">Alabama has recently enacted legislation through a constitutional amendment and through an enabling act that changes the Voter Qualification Acts that puts it very nearly on a footing to that of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="8000.720" offset="32107269">I think part of the legislation was adopted to that but it passed subsequent to the passage of Voting Rights Act, therefore, it's fraud, we can't apply regardless of power or good it might be or how effective it may be to get rid of some of the conditions that Congress is attempting to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="8027.207" offset="32213222">As pointed out, I believe in Wall Street Journal commenting on this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8032.822" offset="32235687">It talks about this inequality of statehood proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="8038.292" offset="32257526">It says this would create a truly ingenious paradox.</text>
            <text syncTime="8042.424" offset="32274139">The illiterate citizen, Negro or otherwise, would find himself with more rights in Alabama and her five outcast sister states than the great State of New York, more of the educational level of the voting citizens of Alabama, the low level of which is part of the general complaint against it by civil rights leaders would be further reduced and this by federal sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="8068.963" offset="32380197">Unfortunately, the irony is not funny.</text>
            <text syncTime="8071.806" offset="32391586">They need to paradoxilize a serious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="8074.770" offset="32403498">Is it moral that our national law should apply one rule to one state and another to another?</text>
            <text syncTime="8082.373" offset="32433904">That of course is the fundamental proposition in violation of the equality of statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="8089.325" offset="32461699">And finally, with respect to my portion of the Act of the argument, it becomes an unlawful delegation of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="8097.014" offset="32492419">Section 5 of the Act attempts to confer non-judicial powers on the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="8102.660" offset="32514988">That is the proposition which would be argued by the Attorney General of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="8107.068" offset="32532647">Section 6, refers to judicial powers on the executive department, that is the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="8112.998" offset="32556366">When Section 6 authorizes the Attorney General to appoint federal voting examiners, it authorizes him to take action which suspend and supersedes the State's voter and registration system.</text>
            <text syncTime="8126.303" offset="32609656">It's a punitive proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="8130.280" offset="32625539">And Section 8 authorizes intrusion by these examiners upon and in appearance with purely state and local elections and procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="8141.914" offset="32672037">All, after he, the Attorney General decides that because in his judgment or as things appear to him and I'm using the language of the Act now, more or less people of one ethnic group were registered to vote than another, there was in fact some violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8162.709" offset="32755210">Then, when he exercises that judgment or things appear to him in a certain way, we say, that using that power which was delegated if that is actually a delegation of judicial power to the executive department.</text>
            <text syncTime="8179.718" offset="32823233">The Act says is, “judgment” is the key to its remedially corrective or punitive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="8187.821" offset="32855730">The Attorney General's judgment in turn and based on his belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="8192.017" offset="32872448">We know the judgment of any court was based on its belief of the facts involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="8199.118" offset="32900869">Consequently, Congress has attempted a constitutionally impossible test through the statutory delegation and is the test of avoiding the fundamental separation of judicial and executive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="8213.834" offset="32959697">It has unlawfully conferred judicial power upon the executive and made the Attorney General and both the judge in execution in respect of if, when and how there should be federal suspension and replacement of a state registration process by a federal system, not by in an effort by something created by Congress, a federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="8237.016" offset="33052484">As Justice Sullivan stated in Springer versus Philippine Islands, 277 U.S. 189, “It is an inherent general rule in the American constitutional system that both the legislature cannot exercise either executive or judicial power”.</text>
            <text syncTime="8255.071" offset="33124686">The legislative treatment under question is a double-barrel attack against the constitutional separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="8264.898" offset="33163975">First, it assume that Congress has the judicial power of deciding when on or what circumstances federal voting examiners and all their panoply of power may be pirated in these capital states where local election laws are superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="8281.653" offset="33231057">And then second, it delegates such judicial power to the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="8287.436" offset="33254149">That the legislature had no judicial power which it can delegate, it cannot give such power to an executive officer to determine controversies as to voting rights and then render a decision to determine controversies as to voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="8308.671" offset="33339099">And render a decision which is binding on the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="8311.958" offset="33352265">However, that is exactly the situation brought about by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8315.369" offset="33365849">And except that Congress has gone even further and said that no one can even dispute or review what the Attorney General determines and decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="8325.424" offset="33406077">It gives him judicial power and then says no one can review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8331.370" offset="33429901">We realized argument may be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="8333.017" offset="33436484">The Attorney General has merely given the power to supersede and eradicate the State's registration system as antecedent to an administrative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="8344.510" offset="33482459">But this is demonstratively not true because the thing which brings this supra state power into existence is the judgment and determination of the Attorney General himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="8357.106" offset="33532824">The power given the Attorney General under Section 6 is not that of investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8362.356" offset="33553826">The Government may call it an enforcement power but we do not think it is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8368.724" offset="33579321">On the contrary, as we have stated, the Act calls for a mental exercise or decision by the Attorney General which in logic and practice and reality is a judicial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8382.876" offset="33635850">In other words, the adjudicative determination depends on the discretion and belief of the Attorney General and how he viewed the 20 or more complaints which he has received.</text>
            <text syncTime="8393.722" offset="33679318">Also, on his judgment as to the “apparent” of things as related to the ratio whites and blacks registered to vote in which ratio may partially or entirely be unrelated to any Fifteenth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8411.283" offset="33749535">That is void of any clear standards, its application which is a judicial function rather than an executive one does depend alone upon executive discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8422.374" offset="33793944">This despite the law as well put by Justice Cardozo when he said, “I can see that to uphold a delegation, there is need to discover in the terms of the Act, a standard reasonably clear whereby discretion must be governed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8439.932" offset="33864161">There is no such clarity, in the hodge-podge of determinations, judgments, beliefs and how things appear to him, the Attorney General is called for by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8451.459" offset="33910241">The States, its officials, citizens affected by the exercise of such indefinite discretion have no way of determining, the authenticity, the validity or the correctness of any complaints before these are received by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="8465.415" offset="33966038">Nor do they have any opportunity of showing that a racial imbalance in registration resulted from nondiscriminatory arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="8473.195" offset="33997176">For instance, with all the encouragement racial agent provocateurs have received.</text>
            <text syncTime="8477.689" offset="34015148">It is not unreasonable distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="8480.069" offset="34024657">They would purposely surreptitiously, organize perhaps an election boycott, so as to pull the trigger for appointment of federal examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="8493.495" offset="34078365">Because we have seen that federal examiners had constantly abused their authority even under the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8503.020" offset="34116504">In Alabama, a registered persons who cannot read or write, persons who are not 21, persons who cannot even give their own names, persons convicted of felonies, persons who have not been in the State for a year, persons who have been previously raised in the same or other counties thus permitting multiple voting and also registering persons with no effort to verify where they live or whether they are otherwise qualified under state law except for the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8535.349" offset="34245757">For instance, the Montgomery County Board of Registrars has just shown that more than 700 persons registered by examiners in that county alone are unknown when notices went through, that the address is given, they came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="8553.338" offset="34317751">Therefore, under this Act, these persons who may not be furnished or removed from the list by state authorities are still there and as the examiners furnished to the state officials, election officials, no means of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="8571.512" offset="34390476">Then any 700 persons can show up at Alabama elections where these examiners issued registration certificates and proceed to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="8581.581" offset="34430704">On the Section 11 of the Act, it would be criminally dangerous for a state official to challenge or fail or refuse to allow such a certificate barring to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="8591.071" offset="34468634">The net effect, it would be to destroy the honest and valid elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="8595.534" offset="34486502">In respect to one question being raised, we wished to close with these quotations from 295 U.S.495, because it gets to some of the propositions in Mr. Justice Black's those situations that we heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="8618.242" offset="34577408">“Extraordinary conditions do not create or enlarge constitutional power, the Constitution established a national government with powers deemed to be adequate as they are proved to be both in war and thieves, but these powers of the national government are limited by the constitutional grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="8640.633" offset="34666956">Those who act under these grants are not at liberty to transcend the proposed limits because they believe more or different power is necessary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8652.357" offset="34713872">And that of course is the motivation theme and the real reason passed for the passage of what I would call the motion of legislation that we heard in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="8663.467" offset="34758280">Again, I wish to thank the Court for its courtesy.</text>

            <text syncTime="8675.172" offset="34805091">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8681.126" offset="34828915">The United States Civil Rights Commission and its report to the president in 1965 had the following to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="8691.481" offset="34870293">A week after civil rights marches had been attacked by Alabama law enforcement officers, they attempted to walk from Selma to Montgomery to dramatize their appeal for full voting rights, the president appeared before a special session of the Congress to urge speedy enactment of voter legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8712.381" offset="34953885">The way the events of that march were presented to the world by a press, radio and television, stir the public sentiment that naturally had its impact upon the president and the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="8728.395" offset="35017937">That was a passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="8733.815" offset="35039671">I'd let the record clearly show, let the impression unmistakably be made that my appearance here today and my argument here today, serves in no way to justify or defend that tactics employed by the state troopers of Alabama, the deputy sheriffs of Dallas County or to the consequent as they carried out their acts to hold that march, that fatal day, there is no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="8761.631" offset="35150952">Either legal or moral, to that brutal and unwarranted attack, there can be no rational defense and the fact that the -- of any orders that was given to them by their superior officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="8774.493" offset="35202361">No justification by the approval given those law officers to use those tactics by high state officials in my state.</text>
            <text syncTime="8783.569" offset="35238724">However, I do respectfully submit to this honorable Court, the national reactions stimulated and brought out, brought into clear focus by these Acts, moved the Congress of the United States to act swiftly, not only in an attempt to wash away the injustices of this particular case but also the underlying just grievances of the Negro citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="8811.092" offset="35348752">Whether I submit that passions of righteous indignation and in the press of time, neither due contemplation or sound deliberation was given to the resulting legislation, thereby presenting to this Court, background or setting which calls for indeed the searching and careful consideration of all of the arguments, constitutional arguments both for and against the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="8840.469" offset="35466303">The State of Alabama expresses very much concern with the method by which the States affected have been brought under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8850.874" offset="35507890">If not in fact it seems to us that it's very kindred and principled to the way the legislature of Alabama drew the city lines of the City of Tuskegee by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="8862.008" offset="35552402">Statute struck down by this Court in Gomilion and they're formerly used to include certain States and exclude others, leaves the excluded States free to use literacy test and local course, which is the usual American way such as not true, the States included or affected by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8883.483" offset="35638293">The use of these deliberate methods, discrimination between States and the citizens there and I believe is obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="8892.596" offset="35674760">The affected states, the affected States despite their desire to have a literate electorate, now find the Federal Government certifying illiterates, contrary not only to the state law but contrary to the wishes of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="8907.717" offset="35735259">So Alabama here today joins her sister states in opposition to this Act, and Your Honors, we might will join South Carolina in this -- because I think it is all but judicially, and certainly executively and congressionally declared that though this may be South Carolina's lawsuit, this is certainly Alabama's law.</text>
            <text syncTime="8932.306" offset="35833584">This argument on behalf of Alabama is directed to the defendant's contention that this Act, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 suspends or destroys the right to provide that one must be able to read and write, the English language as a condition precedent to registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="8950.605" offset="35906832">One who can read and write is literate of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="8953.468" offset="35918221">The federal courts in Alabama have repeatedly ruled, repeatedly ruled that one must be able to read and write.</text>
            <text syncTime="8961.517" offset="35950508">They have repeatedly declared that this is a pre-requisite to registration under Alabama law.</text>
            <text syncTime="8969.307" offset="35981646">And the discrimination enjoined in those cases, I think some 15 in my State, the discrimination enjoined has arisen from the use of these tests or the -- these test to determine illiteracy or literacy and in determining whether one embraces the duties and obligations of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="8988.476" offset="36058342">For instance, it's acknowledged and in Macon County, Alabama long, lengthy sections of the Constitution were given to Negroes to read while shortest sections of the Constitution was given to the whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="9004.284" offset="36121558">While discrimination in the use of test and the demonstrations of literacy had been enjoined in a number of cases, no court in Alabama has ever decreed that one need not be able to read and write in order to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="9017.270" offset="36173490">But now, not only the Commission on Civil Rights and the defendant here had insist, based their claims or contends that the Act required the registration of any otherwise qualified person, even though he may not be able to read or write.</text>
            <text syncTime="9033.359" offset="36237855">This by virtue of Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, and yet as late as 27th April, 1965, this Court in Harman versus Forssenius said, once again the States have long been held to have broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised and of course as taught in Lassiter, have the right to determine and provide that only those who are literate may exercise that franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="9061.935" offset="36352167">This certification by federal examiners of illiterates declared -- declaring them qualified to voters therefore I believe unwarranted in the States that have these literacy requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="9076.090" offset="36408801">And the defendant's claim that this Act permits this if correct renders Section 4, this Act unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="9083.137" offset="36436908">In this respect is invading the powers of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9088.128" offset="36456866">For this reason, any attempt to uphold the Act of 1965, must begin with the determination by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9097.288" offset="36493542">The Act abolishes test and devices only that clearly states this.</text>
            <text syncTime="9103.863" offset="36519873">Tests and devices are defined in the Act and defined as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="9108.863" offset="36539831">They phrase text or device -- test or device shall mean any requirement that a person or a prerequisite for voting or registration for voting, one, demonstrate the ability to read and write, understand and interpreting the matter; demonstrate any educational achievement of his knowledge on a particular subject; possessed moral good character -- good moral character through his qualifications by voucher or registered voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="9134.349" offset="36641813">If the Congress -- if the Congress should abolish test and demonstration as to one's sanity as you so stated, they might well do.</text>
            <text syncTime="9146.116" offset="36688833">Suppose that Congress abolished the test and demonstration as to one's sanity, who among us would contend that immediately -- the mental incompetence have automatically been qualified to register and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="9158.886" offset="36739929">Now, suppose the Congress passed the law and suspended the test to determine a man's age, would this automatically qualify infants to register?</text>
            <text syncTime="9171.288" offset="36789561">Constitutional questions therefore as here pertinent must start, must start at the familiar rules of construction with the premises that tests and devices only as defined and suspended by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9185.518" offset="36846508">Not the requirement itself that one must be able to read and write, write tests and devices only.</text>
            <text syncTime="9194.239" offset="36881304">Under the law of some states, the burden is upon the applicant to show his qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="9201.831" offset="36911710">By simple statement under oath, a simple statement under oath that I can read and write or the answer to a simple question, can you read and write, were satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="9210.627" offset="36946923">Completely satisfied and would not force upon a state, literate electorate contrary to its laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="9218.468" offset="36978270">Federal examiners could ascertain this fact by the addition of one simple question to the form now used and could be in compliance with that of state law provided their appointment is held legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="9230.527" offset="37026544">A person is asked his name, there's no question about that, it is accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="9236.071" offset="37048696">He is asked his residency, is it -- has it the required link, there's no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="9243.095" offset="37076804">He is asked his age, there is no challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="9245.900" offset="37087984">Why couldn't he be asked, can you read and write?</text>
            <text syncTime="9248.875" offset="37099896">Why couldn't that be a requirement?</text>
            <text syncTime="9254.608" offset="37122779">The Department of Justice has argued in the cases in Alabama now pending at Section 4 (a) of the Voting Rights Act prohibits any election official in the areas affected from denying the right to be registered or listed because one's and ability to read and write.</text>
            <text syncTime="9271.665" offset="37191011">No doubt the same argument will be made here.</text>

            <text syncTime="9365.287" offset="37565503">-- our requirement that one be literate.</text>
            <text syncTime="9367.856" offset="37575847">And that's precisely the point that I'm trying to make, you see Alabama stands in a peculiar position here, we stand convicted some 15 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="9378.375" offset="37617852">And I stand and admit that the tests or devices have been used in a discriminatory manner in my state.</text>
            <text syncTime="9386.955" offset="37652229">And yet, a great many of my counties as I will get to later, never have permitted to this and our States wishes and desires that we have a literate electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="9399.473" offset="37702280">I need to make a distinction between tests of literacy which can easily be used and has in the past been used in my state for purpose of discrimination, make a distinction between tests of literacy and the actual requirement that a person actually be literate.</text>
            <text syncTime="9421.115" offset="37788902">My contention is if the Congress had intended to prohibit or suspend the state law providing or asking or requiring that one could read and write, it could have done so by just merely stating the ability to read and write as a qualification for registration of voters and hereby suspended or abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="9441.744" offset="37871344">That could have very easily inserted these lines that had the contention been or is it true that those States that require or desire literacy that Congress could have added these words to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9459.586" offset="37942711">The ability to read and write as a qualification for registration and voting is hereby suspended or abolished, these would have caught enough States in this bill that it would have been impossible to pass, I realized this.</text>
            <text syncTime="9470.217" offset="37985238">Had they done this?</text>
            <text syncTime="9472.133" offset="37992970">But I do not believe it was their intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="9474.346" offset="38001748">I do believe it was the intention to stop the use of these literacy tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="9479.050" offset="38020556">Stop them as being used in the discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="9482.113" offset="38032886">I do not believe that it was the desire or the wish of Congress that a state whose desire that their electorate be or literate electorate, that they'd be denied the right to require that they read and write.</text>
            <text syncTime="9496.263" offset="38089415">Instead, the Congress of course went into great detail in defining these tests and devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="9502.390" offset="38113970">These that are used to ascertain literacy and they suspended these tests and devices, very clear on this Act, by the language that's very plain and clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="9510.744" offset="38147406">In Section 4 (e), however, as the person's educated in American flag schools in which the predominant language was other than English the Congress said, it is necessary to prohibit the States from conditioning the right to vote of such person on ability to read, write and understand or interpret any matter in the English language.</text>
            <text syncTime="9529.079" offset="38220758">This is quite different from 4 (e), it also gives knowledge that the Congress knows how to use language desired to obtain a given end.</text>
            <text syncTime="9539.631" offset="38262972">For Section 4 (e) has been ruled unconstitutional in Morgan versus Katzenbach 247 F. Supp. 196.</text>
            <text syncTime="9547.128" offset="38292856">It's also noted that the Court their said in effect and this is of course my main contention that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 primarily intended to prevent discriminatory administration of the right to register and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="9562.180" offset="38353147">Primary intended to prevent discriminatory administration of the right to register and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="9569.040" offset="38380523">And during a hearing before subcommittee number 5 of the Congress, the defendant herein stated, highly literate Negroes had -- Negroes have been regis -- refused the right to vote, totally illiterate whites have been allowed to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="9582.042" offset="38432559">Now, this does not tell the entire of the whole story.</text>
            <text syncTime="9585.188" offset="38445098">The number of white illiterates registered since the read and write requirement became law in Alabama in 1951 is very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="9593.016" offset="38476445">It is not over an average of eight of ten per county and these -- are those involved in the suits of the -- by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9601.330" offset="38509672">And the Department of Justice, you understand gets copies of the application for registration in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="9606.710" offset="38531197">They searched them here in Washington for white registered illiterates, they sent in the FBI then, agents to of course contact and those that are thought to be illiterate and summon them to be a witness on the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="9620.092" offset="38584801">There is no attempt but no effort made to see have there been a few illiterate Negroes to slip through at the same time, only white.</text>
            <text syncTime="9628.388" offset="38617924">And no case have they presented in a great number, not in a great number and the registration contrary to state law of a few illiterates, of a few white illiterates does not authorize similar violations to state law by the registrations of thousands -- literally thousands of illiterate Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="9649.399" offset="38702038">Neither does the registration of ten -- ten white illiterates authorized a registration of ten Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="9658.567" offset="38738714">This would do nothing more than just sanction a continued violations of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="9663.934" offset="38760135">And in the United States versus Atkins, 323 F.2d 733, Judge Reeves for the court had this to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="9672.664" offset="38795034">Rather than making such unlawful practices a permanent fixture in Dallas County, the District Court could on petition by appellant, urged from the registration list those persons proven by the appellant to have been registered by a procedure which does not meet the minimum requirements of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="9690.566" offset="38866610">These persons could then reapply for registration subject to the same requirements as anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="9696.680" offset="38891165">Search relief would be within the broad equity powers recognized in Alabama versus U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="9703.800" offset="38919586">The United States has never pursued this method, yet continuing instead in its efforts to register Negroes without regard to their literacy as required by our state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="9717.222" offset="38973294">As to the administrative remedy, our challenge to a federal examiner or the listing shall be then obtained that may within ten days after the listing of the challenged person is made available for public inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="9731.046" offset="39028569">And if supported by affidavits of at least two persons having knowledge of the facts constituting the grounds for challenge and certification that a copy had been served either in person or by mail on the challenged person at the place of his residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="9745.506" offset="39086456">Now, the Act is sound of course as to just who will make this challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="9749.413" offset="39102025">And through December 28th, 1965, according to the Civil Rights Commission, 36,161 Negroes and 190 whites have been found eligible by federal examiners in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="9764.578" offset="39162734">It is estimated that a large part, possibly even a majority of these are illiterates.Neither the -- my office nor anyone else could follow the Act in the preparation of the number of challenges required on the grounds of illiteracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="9779.967" offset="39224278">In addition to that, illiteracy challenges are futile, since the examiners have instructions to certify illiterates.</text>
            <text syncTime="9787.600" offset="39254789">Also that the purpose of the administrative remedy is to decide questions of individual applicants' compliance with the qualifications required by the examiners, not to pass upon what those qualification should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="9801.640" offset="39311005">What is state law is a pure question of law for the courts and not the examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="9808.591" offset="39338799">One final observation before concluding, this, on the very day of the service of Alabama's brief, December 13th, 1965, a new constitutional Amendment relative to the qualification and registration of electors in Alabama was proclaimed ratified.</text>
            <text syncTime="9828.362" offset="39417793">Under the new amendment, good character is no longer required and the provision in effect of November 1st, 1964 that one must embrace the duties and obligations of citizens -- citizenship under the state and federal constitution has been eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="9844.749" offset="39483413">Now, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provides, however that when a state is covered by the Act seek to change these voting qualifications or procedures, that those in effect on November 1st, 1964 must either obtain their approval of the Attorney General or initiate a federal suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="9861.774" offset="39551540">The Attorney General objects so if they're not been submitted to him for approval, and you'll always may not be enforced until the District Court for the District of Columbia rules the changes will not -- of the purpose of affecting or denying the right to vote because of race or color of any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="9878.212" offset="39617264">It appears therefore that the State have said it may not remove conditions which have thus far or before previously led to claims of discriminations, unless by suit in the District of Columbia or prior approval by the defendant himself, a rather, unusual situation to say the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="9900.725" offset="39707335">But I will say as my conclusion, I remained firm in my conviction, very firm in my conviction that every qualified citizen should be permitted to vote, that literacy should be a basic element of qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="9918.825" offset="39779746">Discrimination regardless of its origin, whether it'd be on account of race or color, whether it'd be on the use of literate test or literacy demonstrations, must be eliminated, discrimination for any reason must be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="9931.587" offset="39830737">And as I previously stated, over 50 of Alabama's 67 counties have never discriminated in voter registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="9938.849" offset="39859785">And even in those counties where this pattern has been found there has been great improvement or of much progress in some of those counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="9947.205" offset="39893222">And although I merely ask that literacy be a condition precedent or a prerequisite or a requirement of voter qualification, I remain firm in my view that it not only should be, but it is allowed under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9964.874" offset="39963857">Now, I also remain very firm in my view that discrimination should be eliminated by constitutional means, and this the Congress did not do by the passage of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9976.965" offset="40012236">The end sought simply does not justify the means used as to South Carolina or any other State included in the provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9986.463" offset="40050270">Your Honors, I would submit that no man, no man has for or shall continue to fight harder than I have to protect both the human and constitutional rights of the Negro and my state.</text>
            <text syncTime="9999.476" offset="40102306">Whether it be determined that the Voting Rights Act of 1965, requires a registration of otherwise qualified person, even if he not be able to read or write, if this is required when the state statutes clearly require that a person be able to read and write in order to vote, it should be struck down as invading the powers of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="10023.091" offset="40196765">Or, this Court should certainly judicially determine that this Act does not or cannot constitutionally prevent States from requiring a person be literate in order that he'd be allowed to vote.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joe T. Patterson</label>
            <text syncTime="10046.352" offset="40289761">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="10047.682" offset="40295090">I would like only to take ten minutes of the allotted time to the State of Mississippi, leaving the balance for the Honorable Judge Clark to this special assistance associated with me in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="10060.255" offset="40345454">I shall address myself solely to the triggering clause and the nullifying state laws by suspension -- by suspending a “valid” constitutional state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="10074.081" offset="40400729">I submit that the 50% figure as of November 1, 1964, on the 50% participation in presidential elections of 1964, is an arbitrary and mythical formula admitted to be solely for the purpose of reaching these particular States intended that the Act shall be applied to.</text>
            <text syncTime="10096.197" offset="40489232">And further, just as deliberately designed and intended to exclude all other States and never to apply to any other State although other States may at some time in the future fall within this very 50% formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="10112.050" offset="40552552">Therefore, the 19 or 20 States including Massachusetts and New Jersey, who appear and argue orally as amicus in support of the U.S. Attorney General can do so that it contend and secure in the thought that the arbitrary, unprecedented and in our opinion unconstitutional provisions of this Act cannot and never will apply to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="10137.028" offset="40652549">At the Voting Rights Act of 1965 further provided in addition to the 50% formula as of November 1, 1964 that it should also apply to any State that had a literacy requirement at the time of the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, then I am confident the Commonwealth of Massachusetts would be here as amicus in support of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="10159.969" offset="40744291">Because at the time the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, Massachusetts had a strict literacy requirement and her senators and congressmen defeated proposals to include literacy in the Fifteenth Amendment that this Act provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="10174.830" offset="40803746">That it should apply to States having property requirements to vote at the time of the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10181.236" offset="40829346">Then Rhode Island and New York would be here as amicus in support of South Carolina because they insisted on retention of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="10189.497" offset="40862365">That this Act provided that it should apply to States that had voting laws designed and intended to discriminate against certain people, on account of national origin at the time of the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10202.247" offset="40913356">The West Coast states, particularly California, would be here as amicus in support of South Carolina because the record shows that the senators from the West Coast states used harsh language in no uncertain terms in expressing their desire and the intention to exclude the Chinese from the ballot at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="10222.532" offset="40994544">If the Congress can pave this Act to laws and conditions existent in the State as of November 1, 1964, regardless of whether such laws and conditions have changed into that day, then by the same authority as well as logic, it could go back to 1869.</text>
            <text syncTime="10240.586" offset="41066747">My counterparts who would be here as amicus in support of the U.S. Attorney General, will I'm sure say, we have changed or repeal those laws that discriminated on account of property or literacy requirements, on account of national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="10255.139" offset="41124948">And I stand here, and say that the State of Mississippi has since November 1, 1964 by amendment to its constitution and by acts of the legislature, repealed and changed its laws governing registration to vote, reducing such requirements to a minimum, incapable of discriminatory administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="10278.460" offset="41218257">In attempting to apply the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the State of Mississippi, the government seeks to punish a state because laws were in existence in Mississippi on November 1, 1964 alleged to be discriminatory and because 50% were not registered or did not vote in November 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="10297.867" offset="41295893">Irrespective of the admitted fact that such laws have now been repealed and registration requirements reduce to a bare minimum that in no way violate the prohibitions of the Fifteenth Amendment that which this very Act is bottom old and states in its very title that it's an Act to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10319.942" offset="41384187">We submit that the pronouncements of this Court, beginning with Minor v. Happersett in 1875 to Lassiter versus Northampton in 1959 and Carrington versus Rash in 1965, are all applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="10336.001" offset="41448448">And that Congress cannot authorize and direct suspension of state laws that in no way violate rights secured by the Fifteenth Amendment, simply because that state had in the past laws alleged to be violative of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10353.269" offset="41517516">In conclusion, although my friend, the U.S. Attorney General, in hearings in this Act so fit to say that regardless of how the State of Mississippi may change its laws reducing qualification to register and vote, he would not conceive good faith and good intentions to the State of Mississippi in its desire to make registration and voting easier for members of the color and race.</text>
            <text syncTime="10376.843" offset="41611766">I stand upon the record as reflected by the records of the 82 county registrars in Mississippi which shows that since applying to reduce for requirements to register in accordance with the present law of Mississippi beginning August 1, 1965 to October 1965, 66,886 people have been registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="10398.554" offset="41698597">And I am confident that 85% or 90% of that number are members of the colored race.</text>
            <text syncTime="10404.450" offset="41722211">And during that same time, federal registrars and they have come to our States in number but they have only registered during that same period of time 13,120 to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="10417.624" offset="41774874">Therefore, as we're doing better than even -- my friend is with this arbitrary file.</text>
            <text syncTime="10423.605" offset="41798802">Our only difference with the position of the government is that the State of Mississippi has the right to require that a person be able to read and write in order to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="10435.741" offset="41847390">And with that eliminated, we are in perfect accord.</text>
            <text syncTime="10439.365" offset="41861810">In spite of expressions of doubt of good faith by the U.S. Attorney General, I prefer to take that this Court is going to follow the expressions of Mr. Justice Black in the recent case of Cameron versus Johnson which came from Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="10454.079" offset="41920742">When Mr. Black's -- Justice Black said, “It is true that we have only recently held that Mississippi must not deny a constitutional right of Negroes to register and vote, but this of course does not mean that no good or valid law could come out of the State of Mississippi.”</text>
            <text syncTime="10473.237" offset="41997333">We submit that a good and valid law has come out of the State of Mississippi that it should not be arbitrarily suspended that we should be permitted to register voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="10484.022" offset="42040487">This Court has judiciously and as jealously and forcefully protected the right of the individual against discrimination as it should have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="10495.862" offset="42087821">But I respectfully submit that the same court should protect the constitutional right of a state against discrimination and that it should be equally and jealously and just as forcefully protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10512.177" offset="42153127">I thank the Court for its kind attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="10537.733" offset="42255318">By calling to Your Honors attention that the State of South Carolina is before this Court, not qua state but as parens patriae of people, of individuals, of persons, just as much individuals, just as much citizens as members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="10567.824" offset="42375690">There's no reason to make a distinction between Dave Robinson, a citizen of South Carolina, who is an individual here complaining about this Act and who is in effect telling this Court that the Congress of the United States in attempting to deal with what it considered an evil has in fact violated the Constitution under which it operates because the Constitution is over every one of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="10605.503" offset="42526365">This document says, no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="10614.853" offset="42563772">This is a limitation on what Congress can do, no matter how noble an undertaking that Congress starts out to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="10624.780" offset="42603478">This limitation is there on everything that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="10631.666" offset="42631064">The classic definition is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without a judicial trial and every aspect of that definition is satisfied in this case, every aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="10648.219" offset="42697310">More simply, it is a legislative trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="10652.720" offset="42715282">If Your Honors please, you will recall that this time last year, I stood before you in a case, United States versus Mississippi, in which we were contending that the Government had filed too broad a lawsuit in which we were contending that the judicial power, judicial power, Your Honors please, did not give Mr. Katzenbach -- Attorney General Katzenbach, the right to pursue the entire State of Mississippi in one lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10686.156" offset="42849029">And that issue had never been made before, this Court ruled against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="10690.920" offset="42868046">And we went back to Mississippi to try that lawsuit and I affirm my state, taken out of the courts, the courts -- the forum that this Court had declared competent to deal with the entire state in one lawsuit but I'm taken out of that forum and into the forum of Congress where no rights are accorded to litigants of a judicial nature or according to the State of Mississippi and numerous aspersions were cast on that State in the course of the congressional hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="10726.820" offset="43011720">We didn't get a judicial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="10729.675" offset="43023109">We were forced to leave a judicial proceeding in the midst of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="10734.629" offset="43042962">A proceeding which by the way it has now been recast as a suit to enforce this Act, a much limited version of the lawsuit we were pursuing to see whether or not in the true test of truth, in the test of truth in a court of law, the Attorney General could prove the things that he claimed to Congress were wrong with voting and registration procedures in the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="10764.168" offset="43161036">He even contends that court ought not be more ignorant than other man, and it's a hard thing to say that that's a bad rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="10774.859" offset="43203877">But it is and the statute of justice herself is blindfolded.</text>
            <text syncTime="10782.538" offset="43234597">She knows nothing except what the litigants produced in a courtroom with the true test of trial procedures available to those who are litigating about what is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="10796.587" offset="43290708">And this is what's wrong with the bill in the sections attacked by South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="10803.734" offset="43319338">This is not to say that the entire Act must go out and certainly not Your Honor, Mr. Justice Black, it's not to say that Congress can't enforce the Fifteenth Amendment but it is to demand that that enforcement be appropriate legislation and it cannot be appropriate if it doesn't square with the document that Constitution is a continuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="10827.184" offset="43413170">It's not one thing here and one thing there, if a law does not square with the entire document, it can't be a constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="10838.251" offset="43457369">And if Congress can right drop shot over you, there's no need to have this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10843.951" offset="43480252">If Congress can't be called to account for its actions within the limited framework of the Constitution, why do you need to sit?To hear appeals from the States apart court?</text>
            <text syncTime="10858.436" offset="43538139">That's not what Article III established this Court for.</text>
            <text syncTime="10862.226" offset="43553290">It's established that's they give you the opportunity to call any department of the Government to account, if it left the bounds of a document we all for to uphold and support and defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="10876.005" offset="43608461">Your Honor please, I'm at exposing point, would you --</text>

            <text syncTime="11786.996" offset="47252334">Those two simple things added to this Act, name every state and every county, just as surely as if the spelling had been there in the bill itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="11831.764" offset="47431429">The accumulation of all powers of legislative, executive and judiciary in the same hands whether of one or few or many, whether the hereditary, self-appointed or elective may just let be pronounced the very definition of theory and Congress made the rule and Congress applied the rule to the State of South Carolina and brought it within the ambit of this Act and that can't help but be a bill of attainder.”</text>
