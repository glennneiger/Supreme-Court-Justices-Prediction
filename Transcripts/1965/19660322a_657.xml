            <text syncTime="19.320" offset="180642">At the termination of my argument yesterday, I believe that it had been established that this procedure that was followed in the trial in this case, the prima facie case in which the State was only required to prove beyond the reasonable doubt all of the charges that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.882" offset="298924">But that the defendant in the case had waived his right to cross-examination and he was not going to present any evidence in his own defense was initiated to the Court or mentioned to the Court for the first time by defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.220" offset="380217">And it is submitted by respondent that he also had the last word as to what procedure was going to be followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.050" offset="511561">The basis, as I understand it, for the allowance of this type of procedure arose as a result of traffic manslaughter cases wherein the defendant had no defense against the charge but if he were allowed or if he were required, the man had plead guilty to the charge then this plea of guilty could be entered against him or could be considered by the Court in a civil action against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.699" offset="642173">In another words, it practically met that when he went in to a civil action, he had confessed his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.515" offset="673416">Now, I believe that and I can only say this from what I've been told in Stark County because personally I'd never heard of that procedure before myself.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.877" offset="1282905">The court immediately then said, “Well, in a prima facie case then you will not do any cross-examining.”</text>
            <text syncTime="305.376" offset="1324910">I'm saying this in my own words.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.121" offset="1331806">It is in the record exactly as the court said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.306" offset="1344554">The court told them there would be no cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.777" offset="1362526">The defense counsel then said, “Well now if something comes up that may not implicate the defendant, I think I should be allowed to cross-examine.”</text>
            <text syncTime="326.373" offset="1408815">At that point the court told him, “Well now, we want everybody to understand what procedure we're to follow and if you are not -- if you don't want to proceed by the case that you have already propose to this court, maybe we should just have a jury trial of it and let it go with that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="346.440" offset="1489168">Then the court told them what he considered to be a prima facie case, a case in which not technically or legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.004" offset="1531382">The defendant is admitting his guilt but requires the state to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.410" offset="1565027">Now, in other words, in such a procedure the burden of proof does not shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.914" offset="1583000">There are still is no presumption of guilt on the part of the defendant because the State still must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that this crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.547" offset="1637543">Now, at that time, it's when the defendant got up, he'd been listening to these proceedings and he said to the court under no circumstances, “Am I admitting guilt -- or pleading guilty?”</text>
            <text syncTime="396.207" offset="1688221">Then the court said to him, “Well now, I would be happy to let you have a jury trial if you so desire even though you waived your retrial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="411.161" offset="1747989">The defendant says, “No, I want to be tried by this court, I've been in jail for 18 months.”</text>
            <text syncTime="417.202" offset="1772231">Now, as a matter of fact and this is born out by his petition that he had not been in jail for 18 months but only two months, 16 of the 18 months have been spent in another institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.547" offset="1825520">The court said, “In all fairness to him then, well you make your mind whether you want a full trial or whether you want a prima facie case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="440.607" offset="1865749">Now, it seems to me that the court was trying to give him every conceivable opportunity to have this case proceed in any way that he wanted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.532" offset="1909530">At which point then, his counsel got up and said, “Your Honor, all we want is a prima facie case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="459.655" offset="1942026">In other words, his counsel had the first and the last word in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.905" offset="1958954">Now, counsel for petitioner has said that he didn't understand this proceeding himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.874" offset="6846882">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.683" offset="6858062">In the few minutes remaining, I should like to address myself to two questions propounded by members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.429" offset="6885125">Mr. Justice Stewart has asked whether or not the fundamental question involved in this case is whether there was a waiver of the basic fundamental constitutional rights which were admittedly denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.434" offset="6925145">I submit that upon this record, it cannot be found that there was a waiver as a constitutional matter as this Court said as long ago as Johnson versus Zerbst, a waiver is ordinarily and intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.153" offset="6983973">Upon the circumstances of this case, there cannot be found an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege for at least five reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.304" offset="7020544">One, it's quite obvious that the judge didn't know what kind of proceeding was involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.892" offset="7038934">Two, it's quite obvious that defense counsel did not understand the nature of the proceeding which was about to ensue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.761" offset="7062444">He did not understand for example that he could not reserve the right to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.132" offset="7079894">Three, even today, the State doesn't understand the nature of the proceeding which did in fact ensue upon whom to the burden of proof rests and the State's own brief that suggest that perhaps it rested upon the defendant, perhaps not the standard of proof is unclear entirely too much confusion to assume that anyone knew what kind of right was being waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.595" offset="7161710">Four, and perhaps most importantly, this is not a case whether the defendant remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.779" offset="7178533">This is a case where the defendant specifically asserted an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.420" offset="7193057">And it's quite clear from the record that the objection was asserted in plain enough terms for the Court to understand what the objection was, and that is that this objection satisfied the requirement established by this Court for purposes of determining procedurally whether an objection is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.224" offset="7256273">It brought to the attention of the Court the fact that a matter was being protested on page 22 of the record when the defendant, now petitioner did object, the Court responded, “Make up your mind, whether you require a prima facie case or a complete trial”, that court understood that an objection was being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.410" offset="7332968">Part from the fact that there was a specific objection being made in this case, an additional factor which would indicate that the waiver was not voluntary and intentional as the fact that defendant had been incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.256" offset="7376436">Petitioner had been incarcerated and that this decision on his part to forego a jury trial was motivated at least in part by his reason to get this case over with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.973" offset="7419277">Now, Mr. Justice White has asked, what kind of choice the defendant or petitioner was confronted with and whether or not the offering by the Court of a choice between a nonjury trial -- I'm sorry, between a jury trial and a prima facie case presents a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.464" offset="7497226">Of course, it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.086" offset="7503705">If in fact the choice of a prima facie case had been made, the requirement of Ohio law that the defendant be permitted to waive jury trial if he decides to do so is a not a constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.275" offset="7556472">But that is not the choice that confronted the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.078" offset="7571728">The choice that confronted him was a choice between a trial and no trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.699" offset="7590118">He chose a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.939" offset="7595133">He was denied a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.399" offset="7600985">For these reasons, petitioner urges that the judgment below be reversed.</text>
