            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="18.804" offset="178552">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.765" offset="198405">This Federal Trade Commission case, which is here in on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit presents the question whether respondent's use of the word ‘free’ in its advertising slogans was properly held by the commission to amount to a deceptive practice within the meaning of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.714" offset="294222">The critical facts are undisputed and I shall state them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.476" offset="317315">Respondent began manufacturing various kinds of paints and selling it under the trade name Mary Carter in about 1950 and it now distributes its products to the public as it has done in the past through wholly owned and franchise retail stores in the Southern and Eastern sections of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.806" offset="414595">The company has been resoundingly successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.336" offset="424730">It grew at a great rate in the first decade of its existence concededly because of the effectiveness of the advertising slogans and sales policy which had been advertised which is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.413" offset="493066">Respondent's own officers in the testimony before the Federal Trade Commission called it the keystone of respondent's advertising policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.272" offset="532459">It has been so successful that in five years from 1955 to 1960 its total sales increased from slightly over $1 million annually to more than $12 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.235" offset="580315">The disputed policy is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.510" offset="593377">Respondent packages its paint in quart and gallon cans, but it sells to the public on terms which are succinctly stated in its two most commonly used advertising slogans, “Buy one get one free” or “Every second can of paint free”, occasionally they add to that the words “of extra cost”.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.203" offset="700165">Consumers are told in other words that a single quart can of Mary Carter paint sells for 225, that's the usual price most of the quart cans, but that a free can, “free” is given with every can that's purchased for 225.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.476" offset="773308">Similarly, respondent represents that the price of most of its one gallon cans is 698, but that a second can will be “Given free” with every 698 purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.286" offset="828479">On these facts, the Federal Trade Commission after appropriate proceedings found with one member dissenting that the use of the word free violated Section 5 and that it impliedly misrepresented the customary and usual retail price of Mary Carter paint and it entered a cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.759" offset="918444">The Court of Appeal disagreed and they entered an order directing the commission to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.423" offset="949060">I should like to turn first to the question of deception, which troubled the dissenting commissioner and the majority of the Court of Appeals and more particularly to the broader issue whether even if Mary Carter makes its entirely clear on its advertisements that this is a consistent sales policy buy one get one free or every second can free, the use of the word free is deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.716" offset="1074239">I should say at the outset that we accept for purposes of this case Mary Carter's claim that it consistently directed its retailers, franchise dealers and wholly owned retail outlets not to sell a single can of paint at less than 698 or 225.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.494" offset="1149367">In other words that these dealers were instructed that two cans of paint and one can of paint should bear the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.514" offset="1185416">The question is whether under these circumstances the commission could find that it was deceptive to call the second can free.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.161" offset="1220002">Now there can hardly be any doubt I would think that the word free or any language carrying that kind of meaning is a very potent attraction to consumers and buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.781" offset="1262529">It makes them buy maybe out of what Judge Brown and his concurring opinion call a habit of self delusion as to free products.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.876" offset="1306833">If buyers are likely to be mislead by Mary Carter's use of the word free into thinking that they are being given a bonus that they are not actually receiving and if they then buy that can or that product of paint rather than a competing product because of that reason, the representation if it is false or misleading may certainly be prevented by the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.956" offset="1411218">The representation is misleading in this case we submit simply because the word free as used by Mary Carter means nothing more that the company is chosen to call one can of a two can package free and has chosen to attach to the other cans the full retail sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.080" offset="1495646">If it's sales policy is stripped of the Mary Carter slogan, then it's obvious that what all that the company is doing is it's selling paints in combination packages of two cans and it is charging for the two cans what is in effect a two can price.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="367.534" offset="1573491">So it would be relevant as to what paint of equal quality, sold a competitive paint of equal quality, but it’s sold for whether it was around about $2.25 a quart or whether it was closer $4 a can or a $1.15?</text>

            <text syncTime="388.716" offset="1658232">In the commission's opinion and we submit that was right, the quality of the paint was irrelevant.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="405.393" offset="1724897">Well, the price of paint of competitive quality is I think irrelevant as to question of whether Mary Carter's own sales policy is deceptive, in other words the fact that Mary Carter paint maybe equal to paint of 698 quality or maybe better or worse doesn't we submit entitle it to call one of two cans that it sells free.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.803" offset="1830536">It may justify Mary Carter in setting its price at 698 and advertising to the public, we are giving you paint that's as good as 698 paint or setting the price of 349 a can and advertising to the public, our paint it is good as 698 quality paint at 349.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.437" offset="1901171">So you are getting double your value.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="455.582" offset="1925726">Mary Carter attempted to introduce evidence into of the record that their paint was equal in quality to competitor’s paint selling at 698.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="464.912" offset="1963029">Per gallon and the examiner excluded that.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.825" offset="1978702">Now for purposes of the case at the present juncture we're willing to accept for our arguments sake that the paint is as good as other paint of 698 quality and that Mary Carter maybe able to truthfully to represent that it is as good as other paint of 698 quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.710" offset="2046203">Well of course these are the kinds of things that consumers choices maybe determined by in terms of quality, in other words Mary Carter can sell its paint at any price it chooses and claim that it is of a certain quality and the consumers are free to believe or disbelieve that.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.772" offset="2118510">All the commission says is that they may not set as six -- therefore claim that another can is being sold free.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="569.011" offset="2379421">The commission I believe would say that, that is proper so long as the offer is a limited time offer, in other words it will ultimately within a reasonable time, I don't think the commission would allow this to go on for a year or two, but if it's a one month offer or a two month offer and the price then would go back to 698 per gallon and two gallons would sell in effect $14, then that would be a fair representation to consumers for that limited period they are in effect receiving a bonus which they can't receive when the offer does not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="637.418" offset="2653080">If Mary Carter decided he is going to do it, in effect intermittently, then it has no intention of selling a single can any longer at 698, it will be selling into the future two cans for 698.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.858" offset="2858820">In effect, that the slogan buy one, get one free or every second can free is misleading in two related respects really.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.831" offset="2894660">When a consumer is told buy one, then he assumes, as he has every right to assume that buy one means buy one at the price of one and then you get the second can free.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.222" offset="2948263">When in effect, Mary Carter has a consistent policy of selling two for what is purportedly -- it's price for one, then the consumer is not buying one at the price of one, he is buying one and getting an additional can for the price of two.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.345" offset="3020779">In effect both buy one and every second can free mean the same as two for the price of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.148" offset="3063933">Respondent in its brief in this Court claims that it has never advertised two for the price of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.703" offset="3086190">But the representations are indistinguishable, every second can free means that you're getting two cans for the price of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.501" offset="3117328">And when Mary Carter sets its price in effect at a price for two it is no longer giving two for the price of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.770" offset="3162467">Now, even if the advertisement had added to it, the caveat that this is a permanent policy of the company, that doesn't in any way avoid the misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.851" offset="3214817">Saying to consumers we always give everyone a second can free, is self contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.952" offset="3247208">The only way you can translate the words we always give everyone a second can free into comprehensible English, is to say that it means we always sell our product in two can packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.211" offset="3292244">And if that's what Mary Carter is doing then the commission's order on this case just requires it to say that and not use the words free.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.785" offset="3326516">Now, it's true that a buyer who stops to think and can puzzle out the meaning that we always give everyone a second can free may be able to discover after considerable thought that this just means a two for the price of two policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.010" offset="3527450">There is one in which Mary Carter, reportedly the woman who is in-charge of the corporation says that she tells her Board of Directors every year, that we should start selling -- the Board of Directors tells her that we should start selling paint at half price and she responds to them no I'll never do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.907" offset="3727026">An illustration of the fact that there is nothing here that's really free, may serve to demonstrate the point more clearly.</text>

            <text syncTime="992.591" offset="4073723">The commission distinguished between Mary Carter's use of the word free, and the use of that word in cases like Black and Book-of-the-Month club on the ground that in those cases, the product being sold had a usual and customary or usual and regular price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.955" offset="4143208">This distinction, we believe was sound, because when there is an established price for what we call the tying items, in other words the product that has to be purchased as a condition for receiving the supposed free item, neither of the two misrepresentations that we've previously discussed, neither the misrepresentation as to usual and customary price nor the representation that something is being given away free has actually been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.089" offset="4279777">The word free under those circumstances has an objectively ascertainable meaning and entirely apart from the seller's own manipulations of his product, a purchaser can honestly conclude entirely on his own that he is receiving something as a bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.074" offset="4355636">The simplest case of course in which some is free is when it's given when it's given with no strings attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.322" offset="4376639">But if the condition of obtaining the free item is the purchase of another product, the commission has held that it can still be meaningfully free if there is a standard, objective standard for comparing the offer being made, either to -- at a limited time or to a limited group of people, with what is the practice when the offer is not in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.183" offset="4464097">In other words, if a buyer can say to himself, I had to pay $0.25 for item X last week or others who are not in my special class had to pay $0.25 for item X.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.898" offset="4527000">And either this week or because I am in a particular class, I am able to obtain both items X and Y for $0.25, then he is getting something free in a meaningful sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.736" offset="4578304">He is getting something which he could not obtain at some other time or which other people who are not in his position would not be able to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.862" offset="4618846">Now that's the distinction which the commission made between this case and the Book-of-the-Month Club and Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.664" offset="4646013">In both Black and Book-of-the-Month the offer was being made to new enrollees only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.606" offset="4669837">In other words they were told, if you sign up in our book club you will receive free a certain number of books on the condition that you purchase certain others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.049" offset="4711528">Now, the other members of the club who were not new members, were not able to obtain the very same offer, they could buy all the books which were being sold as a condition for receiving the free premium and yet they would receive no free premium at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.644" offset="4785925">So that the limited class of people to whom the offer was directed were in effect receiving something free in some sense other than merely the seller's own arrangement of his -- of products sold in a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.945" offset="4859173">It's not as if the seller was just saying, I will call something free because I'll throw it into the package at the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.151" offset="4891982">He was in effect saying only if you were in that class, can you receive these books without any further cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.116" offset="5011832">Number two, you tell us that the examiner excluded evidence as to other products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.970" offset="5051225">Number three, perhaps I'd better ask you this, is there any dispute with respect to the assertion that the selling price is more adhered to as stated, that is the 698 a gallon or whatever it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.504" offset="5205347">But that if it's -- if there is any other standard, if it's misleading, it seems that's perhaps an incorrect way to state your argument, and I would like to hear you elaborate on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.529" offset="5285491">I think Mr. Justice Fortas it's broader than just it having been previously offered at that price, it has to be offered at that price in the usual course, meaning either previously or maybe after the offer is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.948" offset="5343169">In other words, there could be an introductory free offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.557" offset="5353618">When a product first comes on the market and a manufacturer has the intention of selling it at a given price, he can attach something to it at the outset and say this is free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.949" offset="5399176">Or it could be an offer made to -- an offer or unlimited in time, made to only a limited class of people which is in effect what Black and Book-of-the-Month Club were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.573" offset="5461661">The significance of that is that, that really communicates a bona fide message to the consumer which should affect his purchasing choice, in other words a consumer can say, if I can obtain a premium or a bonus for this month, whereas as I couldn't at other times or I can obtain it because I am in a special class, where these other people aren't, he should buy on that account but he shouldn't buy because the buyer just says I am pegging my package and I am splitting it in half and I am calling it half of it free and I am attaching the whole sale price to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.151" offset="5603976">That's just misleading and to the extent that a consumer will be confused and will think he is really obtaining a bonus or something when he isn't in the second of these cases, the commission can justifiably prohibit the use of the word free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.355" offset="5696763">In effect, really, we submit that what Mary Carter has done in this case is really no different than what sellers might do in violation of the rules announced in the Black case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.634" offset="5757889">The Black case, in which the commission decided in 1954, in the Black case, the commission set down guidelines for certain types of free advertisement and it stated that in cases where combination or in cases where free premiums were given on a condition that another product, the tying product was purchased, the seller could not raise the price of his tying product for purposes of covering the cost of the supposed free premium, because that would obviously be deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.368" offset="5900831">A seller would then be doing not -- would not be offering anything free he would merely be adding whatever the premium cost to the basic product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.908" offset="5947016">Now what Mary Carter has done here is simply done this at the outset of it's business, if it is able consistently to offer a free premium or a free can of paint with every can that's purchased, then it should really be in no different position from a paint manufacturer, a hypothetical competitor of Mary Carter who not having maybe had the ingenuity to devise these advertising slogans at the outset, so this paint at 349, although it's quality was 698 quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.661" offset="6078046">Now that kind of -– that competitor could not under the Black rules which respondent accepts as valid, raise its price from 349 to 698 and then advertise as giving one can free.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.146" offset="6319940">In other words, the commission would then have the choice of either overruling Black entirely and going back to its old rule which had been sustained by the Second Circuit or condoning the practice involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1992.884" offset="8074951">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.924" offset="8095117">I would like first to address myself to the matter of fundamental or essential honesty in the product and pricing here and satisfy the Court as to that element which I found it rather strange that the commission wanted to treat as a complete irrelevancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.350" offset="8192815">It has as been the Mary Carter Paint Company here, and it alone who has wanted to go into the question of quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.631" offset="8233880">And the evidence is in and it is abundantly in, despite the fact that the hearing examiner ruled it immaterial, because under the rules, he took it and under the rules he made a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.833" offset="8294693">The evidence could not be clear and it is cumulative and it is abundant, that the paint of this company is just as good or bad, than comparably priced paints of the leading brand manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.417" offset="8381001">This company was born with a basic idea which I submit is fundamentally honest, that it was going to produce a high quality product, that it was going to sell it on the basis of economy, by giving what was fairly expressed as double value and that it was going to express that in it's advertising in the terms of saying that every second can was free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.633" offset="8521853">Now the question naturally arises why did it pick on this slogan, every second can free, because the Federal Trade Commission had ruled precisely on the question that, that form of advertising and merchandising was permissible or as Commissioner Elmen said in his dissent in the Federal Trade Commission here, Mary Carter had every right to rely upon the Book-of-the-Month Club and Black decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.197" offset="8668139">Now, I would like to spend a few minutes upon those decisions because to appreciate this case you have to get the sequence of events as to exactly what has happened with the Federal Trade Commission's dealing with the word free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.826" offset="8742640">It goes back to 1948, when the Book-of-the-Month was advertising just as Mary Carter is advertising, that you buy two books and you get one free and that the Book-of-the-Month Club had done from the day it started business, that was the Book-of-the-Month stock in trade, that was its policy, it began that way and so far as I know it has continued that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.965" offset="8899271">And a complaint was made by the commission on the subject and the commission held that this was misleading advertising, on a very simple basis in an opinion by Commissioner Meede (ph), he said free means free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.173" offset="8976071">The absolute meaning of the word, it has no other meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.042" offset="8991535">And unless you're giving something away with no strings attached and you don't have to buy anything to get it, it's not free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.784" offset="9026539">Now that's an understandable position and that's the position that the commission took.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.119" offset="9051826">But the very next year, this was their decision in Book-of-the-Month in 1952, the very next year 1953, the composition of the commission having changed somewhat, the Black case came up and the Black case was like the Book-of-the-Month Club in which they were saying enroll here, buy four books and we'll give you one free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.582" offset="9169690">Now there was no question that if the commission was going to adhere to its 1952 Book-of-the-Month Club decision, Black was impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.927" offset="9227055">But the commission in quite a lengthy opinion, certainly in a most carefully considered opinion, philosophically and practically facing up to this matter, they said we are going to reverse ourselves; we are going to change the rule, because we are convinced there is a matter of reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.231" offset="9320260">That this use of the word free is something that the business men of this company have been doing for 100 years and so long as it's done clearly, so that nobody can misunderstand it, we're going to allow it, as a matter of considered judgment and with the most solemn pronouncement of the fact, they said until Congress changes the Federal Trade Commission Act or a Court gives it a different interpretation, this is now going to be our rule and they said we state it now for the advice of the business men of the company so that they can understand what is permissible and what is not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.008" offset="9523388">And at the end of their decision, they said it would however be an unfair trade practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.321" offset="9560691">If you use the word free without making it clear what your proposition is, or if you raise the price, your usual price or reduce the quantity or reduce the quality as a predicate for your free offer, that was not only the decision of the commission but they adopted a rule, among their pricing guides in which they incorporated this term of the decision into a rule of the commission and announced in the year 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.695" offset="9722128">And they said in their Black decision quoting from a brief, that their counsel had submitted to this Court, they expressed it philosophically this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.045" offset="9775522">Said, but if the regular price of the article sold without the premium is the same as the price with the premium, the premium doesn't cost the customer anything, it is free to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.547" offset="9849605">And they put the free to him in capital letters, every letter of those words to emphasize the point that they were making, that under those circumstances it was free to the purchaser and he didn't care whether it was an advertising promotion, whether the seller was charging so much that he could recoup and make plenty of profit on that basis or whether he sold at a loss, in any event it was the proper use of the word free, and may I say Mr. Justice White, that the commission has never deviated from that position up until this moment and it faced up to this matter anew as lately as the year 1964.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.686" offset="11586121">And people understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.397" offset="11596988">As they put it in the Black decision, people understand the economics of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.297" offset="11624573">And in 1964, this matter all came up anew in this way, there's been a lot of talk about the permissible use of the word free, so much so that, in the Summer of 1963, the commission held a public hearing, in which they invited everybody to come in and say what they thought about the proper use of the word free and whether or not the rule should be changed in anyway and they promulgated to focus attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.532" offset="11797504">Two different rules or versions of a free rule for the purposes of getting comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.085" offset="11831672">One; which they call Rule A, would have been a reversion to the old original Book-of-the-Month Club rule, that you can't say something is free unless it is absolutely free with no strings attached, nothing you have to purchase, in other words, it’s given away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.576" offset="11905651">And B, was virtually the rule as it has existed under Black, and a lot of people came in, a lot of people came in, this went on for a matter of two days and practically nobody wanted Rule A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.204" offset="11988198">There was this discussion about Rule B which is highly irrelevant to the suggestion which is made here, that a free offer carries with it implicitly that it's for a limited time, and not a regular practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.492" offset="12081298">Now, of course you can't square Book-of-the-Month or Black with that argument because both Book-of-the-Month and Black like Mary Carter were from the beginning to the present always day in and day out on the same basis Book-of-the-Month buy two you get one free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.175" offset="12160084">But, there were a number of people who came in with the thought which Mr. Lewin expresses, that this ought to be for a limited time and you shouldn’t be entitled to use the word ‘free’ unless it is for a limited time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.872" offset="12230823">And they suggested that the rule be amended to make that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.505" offset="12261439">Now, of course, the point at that is clear, everybody understood and Commissioner Dixon in his statements which I quote in my brief made it crystal clear, that there was no such limitation implicit or in any manner, shape or form in the rule as it exists, and by what talking about should we add something and when they got through hearing everybody, they republished the rule in 1964 in virtually the same language that they had it in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.204" offset="12420159">So that in 1964, the commission deliberately made the decision that it was going to stick by the Black and the Book-of-the-Month Club rule and was not going to graft on this idea of a time limitation which we are now told is part and parcel of the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.940" offset="12535097">Mr. Peck, as I understand Mr. Lewin's argument, it is to the effect that in the book club type of arrangement you do have an objective practice by which a regular price for the same article is established, that is to say that you have a requirement and it’s for that reason that he places emphasis upon what he says is the fact that the free offer is made only to part of the group, that is to say to initial subscribers, which I had known, but that's what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.643" offset="12713984">And that in your particular case, there is no objective referral for establishing that this is anything accept a fictitious price, and that's my understanding of his argument that is confusing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.761" offset="12786395">Mr. Justice Fortas, I'm going to have to correct the impression you have about that and I want the facts to be perfectly clear, because there is an argument along this line and it is the argument of the reply brief and I might say that, that argument has a weight of the reply briefs in this Court before it’s been suggested here before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.902" offset="12890990">Not before the commission, not before the Court of Appeals, not in their principal brief here, that they ever make this argument, but in the reply brief, they finally come up with another argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.371" offset="12944906">Now, let’s be precise about it, Black's free offer related only to new members who came in committed themselves to buy four volumes in the course of a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.451" offset="13025155">Volumes, by the way that had no standard in the market of any kind, these were triple volumes of the detective stories which Black and Black alone put together in manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.761" offset="13070399">They said if you commit yourself to buy four of these, we will give you one free, that was Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.039" offset="13099551">Now Book-of-the-Month had two aspects to it, one was exactly that same as Black, in rule commit yourself to buy four books during the course of the year and you will get Andersen’s fairytales free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.874" offset="13174888">But they went on and said also for every two books, you buy you get one free as a book dividend, they used the word ‘free’ and they used the word book dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.476" offset="13253256">Now it was (Inaudible) that Commissioner Elmen said if I may quote him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.485" offset="13281364">Comparing this Mary Carter case to Book-of-the-Month he said, “both involve a continuing offer over an indefinite period of time that can be acted upon again and again by the same purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.107" offset="13351790">Now it is suggested in the reply brief, that after all, the Book-of-the-Month Club decision didn’t pass upon that use of the word free in the second sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.160" offset="13416051">But somehow or other the holding was confined to the use of the word free in connection with the enrollment book and therefore after all these years, it is now discovered that this is a brand new issue, which has never been passed upon before, as to whether you can say buy one can and get one free or buy two books and you can get one free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.845" offset="13534751">Now, I will have to ask your indulgence for a few moments to answer that, because coming in the reply brief, I don’t have any opportunity to answer it unless Your Honors should see fit to give me leave to put in another piece of paper here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.783" offset="13606536">But let me say this about it, in the first place, the commission either said it was all right or they said it wasn’t all right and I really don’t care, which it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.174" offset="13680097">What they said was that the use of the word book dividend as applied to the book that you get after you buy two, that, that charge has not been sustained and it is suggested by Mr. Lewin that all that means is that somehow or other there was some shortage of the evidence of the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.201" offset="13792214">Now it isn't the kind of a subject in which you need any evidence, there it was as plain as it could be, why the commission said the charge hadn't been sustained, whether they had decided that, that was perfectly all right, which satisfies me or whether they didn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.096" offset="13903705">The order that they entered clearly covered either use of the word ‘free’, because it was a broad order which said that the Book-of-the-Month could not use the word ‘free’ to describe any book that was not given away without the condition of buying anything to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.044" offset="14003597">Now, plainly you had to buy two books to get the one book free and the cease and desist order plainly covered that use of the word free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.622" offset="14049886">And if there could be any question about it, the dissenting opinion in the Book-of-the-Month case started out, that very first sentence it says this is a case about a company they gives its customers one book for every two they buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.035" offset="14127522">So there couldn’t be any question in anybody's mind that the use of the word free on the broadest possible basis was involved there covered and disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.354" offset="14208815">And as Commissioner Elmen said that in this case, referring to Book-of-the-Month he said there the club's offer amounted to buy two book and get one free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.144" offset="14259911">And he said, the case is indistinguishable from Book-of-the-Month and the commissioner never said in the majority opinion or counsel for the commission in the Court of the Appeals, oh now that's not what the case involved at all, it only dealt with this introductory offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.023" offset="14339427">Now, I needn't argue to the Court that the commission cannot play fast and loose with its rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.543" offset="14373595">It cannot engage in what Judge Brown aptly said here was individualized discrimination against Mary Carter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.391" offset="14416959">It hasn’t asked to reconsider this rule, it stands by Black and Book-of-the-Month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.412" offset="14440991">It had the whole issue up in 1964 after Mary Carter and deliberately decided it was going to maintain its rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.513" offset="14489475">I submit as commissioner Elmen observed and as the Court of Appeals found, that this case is indistinguishable on any substantial ground from Book-of-the-Month and Black, that the attempted distinctions are really fascicle and upon the basis of the commission's rules which they elect to stand by, the decision of the Court of Appeals here should be affirmed.</text>
