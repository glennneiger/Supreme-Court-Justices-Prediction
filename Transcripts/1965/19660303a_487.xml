            <label>Mr. George T. Altman</label>
            <text syncTime="54.821" offset="322644">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.856" offset="326823">This is a federal income tax case involving a sale of two pieces of unimproved real estate with the very familiar question of capital gain versus ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.822" offset="402683">It involves a -- an acquisition by a group of persons as a joint venture and acquisition of some 45 acres in the Los Angeles area with the purpose of developing it and holding it for rental.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.017" offset="495470">There was testimony indicating that financing -- that there were financing and zoning problems and that incase -- incase these problems were not solve -- couldn't be solved that they would sell the property off in bulk so they wouldn't get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.530" offset="605497">The District Court made that distinct finding that they would sell it off in bulk so they wouldn't get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.192" offset="660146">The -- they also made a finding and in the same very -- very same paragraph that they were holding it for sale or development for rental whichever was more profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.471" offset="757217">During the course of the escrow -- there was a six months escrow and during the force of that escrow, there was considerable investigation of financing many efforts to get first on a total project, a thousand apartments for the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.541" offset="837569">Then when they couldn't that, they broke it down into getting smaller units financed.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.026" offset="879470">For that purpose, it was necessary to subdivide the property in order to cut it down to small units.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.952" offset="907160">But even there and I'm reciting the history chiefly as the Court Appeals relates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.549" offset="941537">And the Court of Appeals obtain, I believe, it has a very good opening statement of the factual history of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.930" offset="987094">They had to break it down into a number of units in order to be able to finance it on a unit basis instead on a single basis that even at that point they were still hoping to withhold what they the frontages, two strips, one on one street, one on the other for commercial development and rental.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.794" offset="1078523">But they weren't able to finance the -- even this and this was -- all took place during the six months period of escrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.134" offset="1115930">And so as the Court of Appeals points out, they were then faced with interest, charges, and payments, and taxes, and so they sold the subdivided portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.312" offset="1164622">They sold it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.274" offset="1176430">They reported the ordinary income on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.840" offset="1186774">Apparently on the theory that since it was subdivided, they have to report it as ordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.547" offset="1209553">I don't think that question is before this Court ago as to whether that was right or whether it was wrong or whether it had any bearing on their estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.706" offset="1258245">Anyway on the question of the purpose, I think the record is very clear that at no time and there is no suggestion anywhere in the record that there was ever a purpose of selling in order to make a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.352" offset="1352808">Respondent's briefs attempts page after page, after page to develop some words, somewhere in the record that shows that but it's a total failure and I covered that in our replied brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.643" offset="1421981">No record and the record is there anything to support the idea that there was ever a plan to sell the property in order to make a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.497" offset="1465344">And the finding of the District Court itself says, “That if their plans for development for income purposes would not carry out, were not successful, they would sell it off in bulk so they wouldn't get hurt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="358.645" offset="1537964">And insofar -- as far as I can see, that in itself indicates no idea of making profit on the thing like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.513" offset="1569416">In fact, it's the very reverse, it's what any normal businessman would do, if went into an investment program.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.821" offset="1602644">At some point, he would try to protect himself so he wouldn't get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.279" offset="1624482">That was all it was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.521" offset="1633468">Now, there is a similar conflict you might say in the opinion of the Court of Appeals which I will come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.269" offset="1708492">But, on that question, on the question of purpose and I might say hereto that after our open brief was filed, the Government brought up as part of the record as an addition to the record, the exhibits in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.609" offset="1785814">And there was one exhibit there, the opening agreement of the partnership which shows its purpose, a very detailed agreement and nowhere, not in that document not anywhere else is there the least suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.080" offset="1859688">And the efforts of respondent to find a suggestion of a profit purpose has let it in it's brief -- in his brief into the some of the strangest conceptions of logic that I have ever seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.388" offset="1956968">But we have covered that in our reply brief and I don't want to take the time to repeat that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.499" offset="1993331">On the second question which perhaps is the question why this Court granted certiorari, the question as to whether assuming that situation that there could be such a thing under the tax law, under the word primarily held for sale to customer such a thing as a dual purpose in a situation of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.190" offset="2124152">I mean note in passing in that a respondent now concedes in his brief that there was a conflict between the Ninth and Eighth Circuits on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.903" offset="2166993">But here we have the question of the meaning that Congress had in mind in the word ‘primarily'.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.306" offset="2220596">In the statute primarily help to sale to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.274" offset="2252466">And it's my contention that the words ‘primarily' means, what the dictionary says it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.478" offset="2285275">There is not a single dictionary, and I went through 15 of them, they're all set forth in the opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.283" offset="2340551">Not one which defines it as meaning substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.680" offset="2366046">Now, under that circumstance, there would have to be something in the statute that there was in the Agnew case which is referred to in both briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.602" offset="2405752">Something in the statute were one provision said principally and the other one said primarily to indicate that Congress possibly had in mind, some kind of a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.000" offset="2447339">But in this statute there is nothing that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.372" offset="2456848">There is simply the word ‘primarily' and I think it is the law that has been recognized for all these for -- for all the way back.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.855" offset="2518810">That when a Congress uses a term unless there is something in the statute or otherwise to require a special meaning that it means what it means in everyday usage so that the average person, the average taxpayer, I might say in this case, can know what it is that the law says.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.288" offset="2620479">And I think and I submit that the people are entitled to know what the law says.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.395" offset="2656946">Now, I don't doubt and the respondent has mentioned numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.472" offset="2689233">There are many situations where there is a rent or sale situation like in Rollingwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.114" offset="2731865">The Rollingwood case in the Ninth Circuit, I think is a one of the good cases on that where property was rented with an option to the buyer to -- to purchase the property, any number of cases involving equipment sales, where it's a lease or option with an option to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.507" offset="2829354">It's one of this lease or purchase agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.818" offset="2842624">There are many of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.376" offset="2848893">Now, in a situation like that, it's entirely deferent and there I believe that the Government is entitled to view the sale as being made in the ordinary course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.232" offset="2916289">In fact, the rental itself is a sort of a variant of a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.699" offset="2942203">It's -- a very much like the installment character, its part and parcel with the whole -- of the whole transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.363" offset="2988805">And the sale there is indissolubly a part of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.738" offset="3014301">So in that case, I think it quite proper to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.555" offset="3033631">In fact that I believe that follows the corn future case, the Corn Products case rather where the sales -- there's a course of sale which is part and parcel of the everyday operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.052" offset="3095594">Now, that's an entirely different thing because there -- the sales -- the property is held primarily for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.560" offset="3137599">The sale is embedded in all the transactions and is the outcome of the transactions and the rental there is only a preliminary factor in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.062" offset="3183574">That's an entirely different story.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.279" offset="3192456">But here in this situation, where there was only a prospect, the possibility that eventually they might have to sell it to save themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.558" offset="3241566">That's not a holding primarily for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.231" offset="3252328">That's exact -- that District Court itself said.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.948" offset="3267166">That was held that they would sell it off in bulks so they wouldn't get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.921" offset="3303006">In fact, I would say that here since the whole plan was one for development as an income property and I might point out that the partnership agreement was a 30-year agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.803" offset="3374582">That in that case, the sale eventually was actually in derogation of the primary purpose and not in preference of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.516" offset="3433409">Now, so that in this case on the question whether or not the property was primarily held the sale to the (Voice Overlap) this rent or sale cases have no bearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.630" offset="3505925">Now as a final position, the Court of Appeal said that when they've got to point where the partners had a dispute and they decided to sell the property, in effect really, it was sale to two of the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.895" offset="3631000">When they got to that point, the Court of Appeals said, that the resolve to make that sale was the evidence of a purpose to hold for sale to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.173" offset="3700067">Now, on the first place, that was obviously not the ordinary course of trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.965" offset="3715218">It was situation in which all but two partners liquidated themselves out.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.833" offset="3742699">And in the second place, it was -- well, if there's the same it's a different view of the same thing that was really a sale to other partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.515" offset="3777390">That could hardly be said to in the ordinary course of trade or business or the customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="931.084" offset="3827754">Well, there indications that the dispute develop over period of three or four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.693" offset="3858160">There was a ranking among the partners because of the difficulty in developing their original plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.701" offset="3890134">Now, I will come to what happen during that period which could be significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.254" offset="3924407">Now, let me -- I said that I was going to refer to a similar conflict in the Court of Appeals' opinion and let me show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.989" offset="3967352">I fail to pick this up in either of my briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.838" offset="3990758">In the record, on page 33, where the Court of Appeals comes to the question of the eventual sale and they said that to put the question another way, was it the exercise of a purpose not to hold rather than of a purpose to hold for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.916" offset="4091068">In other words, they were saying that if it was for the exercise of a purpose not to hold and that would simply be -- that would conflict with a capital gain position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.404" offset="4136939">Whereas if it was for the exercise of a purpose to hold for sale, then it would to that court indicate a holding for sale of the customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.466" offset="4181243">Now, on the first place I don't believe that second position is sound either because, if you say that on the basis of this actual sale using that solely as evidence of a holding, you're begging question because there'd be no taxes if there were no sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.922" offset="4259088">There'd be no problem at all if there were no sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.953" offset="4275179">We would not be here before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.093" offset="4283747">They would be no gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.351" offset="4288763">There had to a sale in order to bring the issue up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.577" offset="4301720">Now, if you going to rely on that very sale for proof a holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.513" offset="4321468">You're definitely begging the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.619" offset="4353860">But I want to go further now and show the conflict in the Court of Appeals have been when they say was it a holding -- was it a -- the exercise of a purpose and not to hold rather that of a purpose to hold for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.023" offset="4415509">Let's go back to page 30 where the Court of Appeals in summarizing the fact says, “So we took the next route”, quoting now from testimony and proceeded to sell the lots, that was after they were faced with the interest charges and other costs, and the -- and then court goes on to say, the frontage parcels were retained still in a hope that commercial zoning could be secured as to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.012" offset="4543404">The prospect of rezoning remained discouraging and the rift developed among the venturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.241" offset="4568377">That's where they show -- when that prospect of rezoning became very dim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.691" offset="4602128">That's when the rift developed among the -- of the venturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.303" offset="4616547">Then it says Lesser and two individuals wanted to get out and be done with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.021" offset="4635460">The other two wished to hold on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.214" offset="4644237">Eventually, those who wished to get out including the Lesser sold out their interest which is in effect what they did because one of the sales was to the other, two partners had stayed in, and the other sale was to a business associate, one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.799" offset="4710588">So, I'm comparing now these two positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.314" offset="4724590">Here, they say, “Lesser and two individuals wanted to get and be done with it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.345" offset="6120782">Now, for that reason I'd like to bring now then now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.018" offset="6135411">What happened between the close of escrow and the sale of these two unimproved parcels?</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.473" offset="6169266">The recitation of the history of the case in the Court of Appeals shows, that the inner group of lots were sold because they needed money for the taxes interest charges and a so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.405" offset="6233004">Now, the evidence is very clear that after that took place, they didn't need any money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.996" offset="6255365">They could hold and were planning to hold the two frontages, they were just holding them and that's when the rift started and the sale was entirely because of the rift.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.827" offset="6298728">I think this is brought up in my opening brief and in fact, I have something in my reply brief too on the same -- on the same points showing that -- oh, yes!</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.262" offset="6384410">On pages 7 and 8 of my opening brief and this was testimony brought out by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.731" offset="6426311">Evidence brought out by the respondent which says and then the Court said, there what I -- he said, “I think, he said that was a reason that they sold that, isn't that right?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.969" offset="6479287">And then the Court says, “That was the only reason, they had a dispute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.674" offset="6494020">The witness, “We could well still be sitting with that property waiting to develop it if they have been a rapport among the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.798" offset="6526516">We weren't press for cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.065" offset="6531636">At that point, they were not press for cash, it was the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.564" offset="6545638">When they sold inner group, they were pressed for money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.308" offset="6560580">They had to meet as the Court of Appeals brings out all of these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.911" offset="6578970">But after was done, they no longer were pressed for cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.506" offset="6597360">They were able to hold and they were planning to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.768" offset="6606451">And then the court -- the District Court said, “I try to question Mr. Malat there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.998" offset="6623378">The Court interrupted me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.650" offset="6629961">And he said, “He says, Mr. Altman and it's very clear, he said more than once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.620" offset="6645844">The reason they sold it was because of the accruement and the dispute and the ill feeling between the partners."</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.161" offset="6671966">And then I said yet -- “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.720" offset="6678235">And then the court said, “That is a reason they sold it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.952" offset="6687222">They have this plan and they would have held it and made all three if they couldn't get the commercial zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.954" offset="6711150">It's very clear, in fact in my reply brief, I'm watching clock because I'd like to have a couple minutes left if I can for a rebuttal if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.084" offset="6759737">But in my reply brief, I bring out some other testimony and this was a deposition right into the record by respondent, not by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.792" offset="6802578">In which speaking of time of the sale, the -- the witness stated, oh, simply that they were not offering it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.360" offset="7048861">And then I think are also have quote from one of the respondent's witnesses where -- oh, yes!</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.870" offset="7078849">On page 6 were he says, “Well, I think it goes much further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.594" offset="7093791">We were not happy with the other people specially lessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.199" offset="7108211">And we made the partnership an author of those substantial prices for the land and said, either the land should be sold to somebody else or sold to us.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.735" offset="7146350">That's what happened, and so the land was sold to them and the respondent in his brief attempts to bring out that the -- the purpose of the buying partners, the statements of the buying partners that -- that the reason why they bought it was to make a profit on the sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.633" offset="7265886">Now, naturally that would mean only a resale by them, they could not say that they bought the property in order to make a profit for the sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.839" offset="7314683">That -- I couldn't understand that at all and the testimony bears out simply the fact it was -- that was a reason why they bought it, that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.500" offset="7353344">And there is nothing, nothing whatever and I've gone through it page by page and line by line, not just the record but the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.626" offset="7393886">And there is nothing to support the idea that there was a purpose of profit on the sale anywhere in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.619" offset="7421889">And the record is clear, that between the time that the inner portion was sold, that after the inner portion was sold they no longer had any need from money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.048" offset="7463581">They were there in the position to hold and intended to hold for development, for income purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.770" offset="7490435">So that when this time came for the sale, there was nothing but that sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.175" offset="7508093">There is nothing else upon which the respondent can rely to show that there was any purpose of holding for sale at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.881" offset="7542888">And I think to that's fundamental because under the law the question of holding for sale to customers must be attributed to the period in which the sale took place or the immediately prior period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.278" offset="7592521">It couldn't go way back to the beginning either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.583" offset="7609657">And there -- the Court of Appeals itself says that many changes took place during that period and I want to point this out and -- I don't know if the Court is familiar with Los Angeles statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.799" offset="7658559">But land goes up and value there from one day to the next.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.056" offset="7671620">It doesn't get this matter of 15 months from the beginning of escrow to the sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.402" offset="7804949">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.918" offset="7819055">I would like at the outset to put the factual question which petitioner has argued in its proper legal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.520" offset="7861478">The statute which we are here concerned with is Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which is printed at page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.530" offset="7913514">Now, the statute in general strokes sets up assistant whereby a taxpayer is entitled to report as capital gain, sales of property where that property fits within certain categories and one of the excluded categories from capital gain, is property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.626" offset="8037857">And as this Court has recognized in a number of previous decisions including the Corn Products case, the general intent of Congress was to tax as ordinary income the everyday profits of a business, but to give capital gain on passive long term accretions in value and it has a -- of course no little problem in distinguishing between the two types of profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.025" offset="8167424">Those from a business on the one hand and those from passive or long term accretions in value on the other, many cases for somewhere in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.599" offset="8213817">The traditional touchstone is been one of asking whether the taxpayer was in business, whether the taxpayer was in business has frequently been -- almost always been left to the trier of fact as a factual question with proper instructions from the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.547" offset="8301589">The courts have enunciated a number of factors bearing upon whether a person is in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.533" offset="8329488">These factors have been included the number of transactions into which he enters, the continuity of the transactions, the size and extent of the transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.678" offset="8374105">The -- activities in which he engage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.288" offset="8388524">Where a taxpayer was engaged in enough activity then he was in business and if he brought a piece of real estate and he was an attorney who were never engaged in real estate transactions before and held this one piece real estate and sold it 20 years later, he got capital gain on that sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.025" offset="8459473">If, however, his activities in the real estate business were sufficiently substantial, so that the trier of fact could, under proper legal standards, find that he was in the trade of business then he got ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.626" offset="8521853">And the question of whether you are in a business and whether the particular property on which the gain was realized was held for sale in the course of that business are typically factual type questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2137.444" offset="8653197">That is, “Were there people in a business, did they hold this property for sale in the business?</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.711" offset="8674200">And what were their intentions?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.356" offset="8680782">Those are things in which we have the findings of two lower courts and we have a great amount testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2153.334" offset="8716727">I think it supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.655" offset="8726026">The second question and the one I -- I assume this Court granted certiorari to, to resolve if possible, is the legal question as to what the phrase ‘property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of this trade of business' means.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.980" offset="8807320">That's -- that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.026" offset="8815470">This -- this Court has frequently recognized that the capital gain statute is perhaps not the most articulately worded statute and it has -- it has recognized that in many instances its got to interpret it with the intension of Congress in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.747" offset="8886314">Now, here the dispute in a number of case coming to the Courts of Appeals, and we have approximately six Courts of Appeals, five Courts of Appeals I think in Court of Claims ruling on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.974" offset="8935320">That the legal question which we put forth in our brief, is whether a taxpayer, who is in the regular business of both selling and renting the same type of assets, whether that that be real estate that he said -- he buys it and then either sells or rent it, whether it be computers that they manufacture or buy and then and sell or rent or water coolers or recording equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.816" offset="9026644">The cases are concern items of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.638" offset="9037928">When the taxpayer acquires an asset which he intends either to rent or to sell and one can say that majority of his income is derived from rental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.609" offset="9085785">And only the minority from the sale, say, he sells 70%, he rents 70% of the -- of the computers or real estate and he only sales 30% of it in the normal course of his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.709" offset="9130193">The Court has found this to be -- assuming the Court has found this to be a business that he's on a business both selling and renting, can you say that taxpayer has held the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of this business?</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.961" offset="9187244">The taxpayers have contended that ‘primarily' means ‘chief' or ‘first' or ‘primary' and that you've got to look the chief motive which they had and if they acquired it with a -- with the motive in mind to rent if possible or with the thought in mind that they acquire 70% of their income from the rental, then they say their chief motive was rental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.817" offset="9294660">And their motive of selling in the ordinary course of business was a subsidiary or secondary motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.125" offset="9315871">It is our position that the word ‘primary' here is broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.317" offset="9336665">It doesn't mean solely the chief motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.539" offset="9349517">This Court had a case before it Board of Governors versus Agnew a few years back in which the exact same word was involved, the word ‘primarily'.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.130" offset="9387865">There the question is whether someone was primarily engaged in the underwriting business when that was only 30% of their income and they get 70% of their income from acting as broker and dealer, etcetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="2911.841" offset="11750693">So while they originally paid capital gains tax on it, they later made up the rest of the tax and have paid ordinary income tax and not sued for refund the statute now having run.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.630" offset="11789876">In addition to Lesser Enterprises which I believe this is clearly in all faces of the real estate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.830" offset="11814640">Two of the other venturers were man named Hicks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.006" offset="11827388">Mr. Hicks was the record shows a real estate broker and Mr. Fenmore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.965" offset="11851212">The record shows that Mr. Fenmore was engaged principally in the real estate business and that had -- he had been engaged in the real estate business for 20 years according to his own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.525" offset="11889455">The other two joint venturers were not full time in the real estate business so far as the record discloses, although, one was looking full time for a real estate deals whatever that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.509" offset="11929370">Now, I point this out as the context in which the District Court got this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.978" offset="11947238">Here what three people, that is petitioner in behalf of Lesser Enterprises, Hicks and Fenmore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.208" offset="11972211">Three of the five joint venturers, who were in the real estate business, who were in the habit of handling property, acquiring it in logic, in common sense shows that they acquired property for whatever purpose they could make a profit on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.673" offset="12022053">If they could build on it, they did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.175" offset="12028113">If they couldn't get financing they subdivided it, if it look more probably sold in bulk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.523" offset="12045458">Now turning to this piece of property, what were their intentions with regard to this piece of property?</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.897" offset="12066983">The petitioner testified that it was located in a fast growing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.976" offset="12087254">And that the -- they had made a good buy as far as price was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.131" offset="12107943">He also testified that they hope to build an apartment development on the entire 45-acres but when they purchased the property, before they purchased the property, they knew that the mortgage market was rough because they were trying to get financing for other similar deals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.718" offset="12170219">As it turned out they were unnable to get financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.244" offset="12180355">The mortgage market remained rough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.031" offset="12187460">They also had hopes of getting commercial zoning on the two frontage parcels, the two 10-acred parcels which are here in question.They never did get commercial zoning on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.709" offset="12230196">In fact, what happened is they acquired the property, within two months being unable to get financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.182" offset="12256110">They began subdividing the interior 25-acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.426" offset="12269066">They subdivided it into 105 parcels and within nine months after acquisition it sold the entire 105 parcels reporting the income as the capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.464" offset="12305220">That is ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.620" offset="12309817">Excuse me, that is ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.691" offset="12318177">During this period, they had received the number of fillers, the word ‘fillers' is used in the record, with regard to the two, 10-acre frontages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.320" offset="12352658">That is the frontage on the Century Boulevard and the frontage on Crenshaw Boulevard that they had not subdivided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.064" offset="12379617">Within nine months after the acquisition of property, they in fact sold those two frontages making a profit on a two frontages of $127,000 which is the profit here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.100" offset="12427786">Now, the testimony on their intention for holding the property other than it was fast are and that they made -- in a fast growing area and they've made a good buy as far as price was concerned was the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.716" offset="12474284">Counsel of the Government asked, “Did you con --” asked the petitioner -- “did you contemplate in acquiring the property, the possibility that rezoning or refinancing or whatever might not be possible?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.338" offset="12512737">He replied, “This is always a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.748" offset="12526320">We felt that we have made a good buy in the property as far as price is concerned, so that if we couldn't do anything in the way zoning, we would sell the whole thing off in bulk.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.469" offset="12561220">He then testified two pages later that, “The type of mortgage financing that we would like for apartment developing was not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.828" offset="12590686">That is financing that would permit us to build apartments for rent and get what we felt was a reasonable return on our equity investment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.191" offset="12632168">When they found that they could not get a reasonable return on their equity investment by building.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.809" offset="12650559">They then subdivided the interior 25 acres, sold the two 10-acre parcels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.179" offset="12672084">Mr. Fenmore, one of the other joint venturers testified, “My own understanding of why we sold it, why in our case we bought it was there was a chance to make a very substantial profit on the sale or sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.706" offset="12714193">And we proceeded to do it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.956" offset="12727150">On the basis of this testimony, the District Court concluded that the subject real property was held for development or sale depending upon which course appeared to be most profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.804" offset="12778559">And the plaintiffs have failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject real property was not held by Plaza, primarily for sale the customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.753" offset="12822340">He'd already said that primarily meant something broader than cheaper principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.314" offset="12840626">Now, one other factual point before I -- before I finish with the facts, petitioner has talked a great deal about the rift among the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.571" offset="12877615">That they wouldn't give sold this property, these two frontage parcels which they were holding for long term investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.069" offset="12899662">They would have sold those within nine months after acquisition but for the fact that a rift developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.586" offset="12921710">Now, it is our position that the District Court heard conflicting testimony on whether the rift caused the sale or not and determined the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.870" offset="12954833">I reach very briefly the relevant testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.603" offset="12965804">Petitioner testified that the lack of report among the partners was one of the elements that entered into the decision it sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.693" offset="12990151">Mr. Fenmore in the other hand, one of the joint venturers testified, that there was no serious rift among the partners until after the sale of the two parcels here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.020" offset="13035499">One more piece of testimony, the petitioner testified that the rift was between Misters Rogen and Millman on the one hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.429" offset="13065070">The two men were not at real estate business full time and Mr. Fenmore and the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.655" offset="13085968">Mr. Fenmore then testified that he remain partners with both Misters Rogen and Millman in another real estate deal for at least six years after the instant sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.245" offset="13136332">Now, on the basis of this testimony which -- which we believe is certainly a testimony, each way is to just how instrumental some disagreement was because Mr. Fenmore himself testified that there was nothing of any serious nature other than the usual partnership disagreements, we -- which contend that this testimony shows some conflict as to just what role a possible disagreement may have had in causing the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.644" offset="13238000">On that basis, the District Court found that any rift among the partners may have expedited the sale but that it didn't change the essential nature of the -- of the parties' intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.968" offset="13479267">You look at -- for the chief purpose for which it was acquired and if the chief purpose or the parties' major intent was to build on it and rent, the fact that they also had the intention to sell and eventually, did sell in the ordinary course of business has given capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.764" offset="13546454">It is -- it is our position that the factual context in which this case arises, well not the -- possibly not the clearest case of the rent or sale dual business is one aspect of the rent or sell business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.893" offset="13610924">These people, we think, acquired the property for the purpose of either renting or selling whichever was more profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.390" offset="13632972">We think it just exactly like the Court of Claims case Recordak, in the Recordak case or the -- there was recording machinery of some type, that the taxpayer manufactured and then either rent it or sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.620" offset="13693889">And they said, “Well, we get the best majority of our income from the rentals of the recording machines rather that from sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.027" offset="13719489">Therefore, our primary purpose in holding any given machine is for rental rather that for sale.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.077" offset="13743731">The Court said that whatever the price -- precise scope of the troublesome term ‘primarily' in other context, it does not exclude from ordinary income the proceeds of sales by one who conducts a dual enterprise involving both rentals and sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.692" offset="13802141">In that setting, primarily invokes the contrast not between selling and renting but between selling in the ordinary course of business and selling outside of that normal course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.441" offset="13845086">And in reaching that conclusion, the Court reviewed the cases which this Court is decided such as Corn Products and the Gillette Motor case in which this Court has said that in order to effectuate Congress' intention to tax his ordinary income, the everyday business profits of an enterprise, it would read broadly the exceptions from capital gain and where necessary, it would construe “other than their ordinary sense.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3668.879" offset="14778911">Well, the crucial factors, alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.200" offset="14788211">One fact is that we think the record shows that the regular course of these people's dealings where to acquire pieces of property of this type 45 acres, a hundred acres to hold it for a years, a year and half whatever period that that the record shows a number of such transactions to a -- meanwhile explore whether they could build the apartment buildings on it, what the mortgage market was like, what the zoning situations was like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.912" offset="14895000">Within a few months they decide whether they would abandon their original -- one of the original dual intentions, that is to build on it and rent it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.709" offset="14934183">If they abandon, they would then subdivide parts of its, self parts of it in bulk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.349" offset="14956753">There are at least two and possibly more transactions where they did exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.198" offset="14976188">In the Buena Park transaction, they held it eight months subdividing part selling a hundred acres in bulk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.019" offset="15003460">In the Garden Canyon transaction, they did the same thing, although, holding period is not shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.679" offset="15026134">Developed part of it and sold the rest in bulk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.012" offset="15035434">It is our position that the regular course of business for these people that the way and which they earn their living was through rentals, through sales of subdivision individual lots, through sales of larger pieces in bulk but this is what they employed their full time business activities on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.308" offset="15116622">It is our position that the facts bear out the findings of the two lower courts and it is our position that when you have that's sort of a factual dual purpose business that they cannot avoid ordinary income under everyday business profits through the argument that they were not holding the piece of property -- property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business but that was merely their secondary intention.</text>

            <label>Mr. George T. Altman</label>
            <text syncTime="3784.091" offset="15239711">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.269" offset="15260400">Everything I think that counsel has said is quite thoroughly covered in my briefs, the opening and the closing briefs so I'll leave most of it to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.848" offset="15318810">There are just a couple of points, one is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.754" offset="15338350">Counsel said that the statute was not very clearly drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.930" offset="15363114">Just what he meant by that I'm not sure but I believe it -- this question has never come up in this case before this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.620" offset="15401880">I believe it's again well understood and held by this Court over a long period that if there was a doubt in the statute it couldn't be held against the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.303" offset="15456632">So, that's -- on that point, there is just one other point and this is, I frankly say, a repetition by me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.114" offset="15499786">The Court of Appeals itself set out and I'm reading again what I read a half an hour ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.592" offset="15525700">The prospects of resorting remained discouraging in a rift about among the venturers Lesser and two individuals wanted to get and get done with it, the other two wish to hold on, eventually, those who wished to get out including Lesser sold their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.670" offset="15578049">I don't believe that on the basis of that statement, it is possible to derive the conclusion that the Court of Appeals derived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.632" offset="15617860">Because by their own statement they say at the end of the question is whether their -- the purpose was not to hold or to hold for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.468" offset="15653282">But that statement of the facts by the Court of Appeals itself shows that the purpose of the sale was not to hold as far as the sellers were concern.</text>
