            <text syncTime="79.726" offset="422327">This case arose upon the conviction of the petitioner, Mr. Collier, for violation of the White-Slave Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.574" offset="457644">He attempted to appeal his conviction to the Sixth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.337" offset="484707">It is from that decision, that ruling of the Sixth Circuit that we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.794" offset="502575">There are two independent alternative grounds for reversing that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.924" offset="539042">The first of this is that the notice of appeal which was so labeled was in fact filed within time.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.679" offset="582092">The second ground was first urged by the Government itself in his brief filed last week and that ground is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.948" offset="623156">That clearly within time, a motion for bail was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.393" offset="648965">This motion for bail in the Government's view and in ours did constitute a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.639" offset="689925">The facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.386" offset="696926">The conviction was on March 24, a year ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.966" offset="711241">The motion for a new trial was made on April 2nd, nine days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.080" offset="739662">Three days after that, the District Court denied the motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.319" offset="760665">Seven days after that, the counsel for the petitioner filed a paper denominated notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.420" offset="817089">The rule involved is the Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.752" offset="846346">That rule states and with the Court's permission I'd like to read just a few lines of that in plain and in unambiguous terms, the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.200" offset="884172">An appeal by a defendant may be taken within 10 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from, but if a motion for a new trial or in arrest of judgment has been made within the 10-day period, an appeal from a judgment or conviction may be taken within 10 days after entry of the order denying the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.860" offset="970794">In this case, the lawyer then appearing for the petitioner literally and very plainly complied with that rule as written.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.646" offset="1017919">Within 10 days, specifically on the ninth day, he did file a motion for a new trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.147" offset="1103914">And then, appearing on page 13 is the denial of that motion which followed within three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.623" offset="1153860">Within seven days of that denial, that when -- again fairly within the literal reading of the Rule, then counsel for petitioner filed a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.969" offset="1219271">The reason given by the Sixth Circuit in finding that this -- that those appeal was untimely is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.983" offset="1251349">The Rule 33, under the Rule, says motions for new trial must be filed within five days after verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.840" offset="1274755">The verdict was also on March 24th, the same day as the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.449" offset="1293145">Hence, the motion for a new trial was untimely under Rule 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.557" offset="1313625">I might add that the motion for new trial was not on grounds when we discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.651" offset="1334000">And for that reason, the Court could not grant the motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.605" offset="1357824">The court did not give its reasons for denial at the time that it denied the motion, it simply said, "The motion is denied."</text>
            <text syncTime="322.902" offset="1395022">The Court of Appeals, in agreement with some other Courts of Appeals, held that where a motion for a new trial is filed even though within the 10 days, specifically provided for, in Rule 37, the motion for a new trial does not in effect toll the operation of 10-day period and does not commence a new 10-day period within which appeal upon that --</text>

            <text syncTime="547.516" offset="2293426">The problem of timeliness has been, the question nearly raised has not been, except to this extent, that new rules do not require nearly as many elements to be contained in a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.365" offset="2356851">It's still to be -- be active either (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="568.538" offset="2377540">I would like to add since we're talking about the ground urged by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.426" offset="2401050">One authority that the Government does not cite, that is Rule 52 or the Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.313" offset="2424665">Rule 52 says that if there is a defect, error or irregularity which does not affect substantial rights, such defect is to be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.816" offset="2474611">Now, I think this is clearly applies to the elements missing from the notice of appeal and reinforces the arguments and authorities urged by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.942" offset="2531140">Returning into the first ground, the Rule as I said it previously, is plainly written, is I believe exceptionally and ambiguous, and was literally complied with by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.209" offset="2600208">This I feel should be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.661" offset="2606059">However to go further, the history of the motion indicates that the draftsman of the Rule, the predecessor rules, knew how to say timely or seasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.501" offset="2653393">This was found in the Rule 3 of the prior rules that the draftsman engaged in drafting the current rules, those about to be superseded, also knew how to say timely for -- they did so in the first draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.649" offset="2721938">And if that the draftsman of the rules which now superseded knew how to say timely, there would have been no problem when they're saying so.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.477" offset="2761331">The Government in its brief points out that there was an intermediate draft of present Rule 37 (a) (2) which is worded somewhat differently than the first draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.359" offset="2816815">However in both cases, the draftsman of the Rule clearly knew how to say timely and clearly, this requirement was eliminated from the rule which was put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.875" offset="2862895">Now, not only is a rule plain, its history, now it supports it.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.618" offset="2885883">The policy set forth in the rules themselves and clearly divided in decision of this Court supports a liberal reading of the timeliness provisions as well as the provisions laying the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.644" offset="2945964">This policy runs through decisions of this Court, both with respect to form of notice of appeal and timeliness.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.803" offset="2978565">The Government I feel appropriately follows this policy in urging that formalities we overlooked in finding that the motion for bail was adequate notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.242" offset="3028302">It does not, I feel, give appropriate attention to that policy in its urging that a notice of appeal so dominated was filed on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.233" offset="3080338">This policy is contained first of all in Rule 2 of the rules themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.865" offset="3094862">Rule 2 says that the rules are to be interpreted to deal simplicity, to deal fairness, and expeditious proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.900" offset="3154944">To be fair, certainly includes not misleading the counsel in understanding the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.562" offset="3185664">The attorney who filed this notice of appeal did as I say precisely the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.823" offset="3206666">It could hardly be considered fair to have this counsel -- to have this petitioner find himself out of court after such a clear compliance with the letter and the rules themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.021" offset="3251493">It certainly is not conducive to simplicity to have such an unneeded and somewhat unexpected complication imported into the rule itself, a complication being that on a timely motion tolls the running of the 10-day period allows dismissal of a new one.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.179" offset="3420139">But I think that's a quibble which is not consistent with the spirit of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.080" offset="3443649">The Court would deny it -- would have to deny it, there's no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.276" offset="3464443">This would -- therefore, not in any way interfere with the proper administration of Rule 33 that governing motions for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.741" offset="3498297">The Government says, "Well, this is not too good because it would create a self-granting the extension of a notice of appeal."</text>
            <text syncTime="857.377" offset="3532884">I think there are two argue -- two answers to that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.607" offset="3545840">First of all, if the rules want to provide a self-granting extension, certainly there's no harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.551" offset="3573530">Secondly, there is no temptation for abuse present if this is in fact the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.318" offset="3600593">It is far easier to file a notice of appeal than it is to file a motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.452" offset="3621177">The temptation for a lawyer to file a motion for a new trial so he get more time would be also impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.213" offset="3656182">It's hard to imagine that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.275" offset="3668511">For that reason, I feel that the harm urged by the Government and by the Third Circuit would just -- just does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.134" offset="3719920">The ground urged by the Government in this respect is that of harmonizing the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.189" offset="3748133">For the reason, I've just stated, I don't believe it creates any disharmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.137" offset="3763911">And furthermore, I believe that that is an insubstantial consideration if that consideration afflicts with the policies of the Act, fairness, simplicity, and expeditious hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.017" offset="3835486">The basic policy that I think pervades both of the issues before this Court is that of referring direct appeals over collateral proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.383" offset="3888880">This policy has been recognized expressly in the Bertone case in this Court and the principles involved in that policy have been followed in the Corey case, the Fallen case in this Court, the Boruff case in the Fifth Circuit, the Calland case in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.640" offset="3961919">These are various settings, all portraying a clear application of that principle and a principle which is solely based not only on the rules themselves, Rule 2 and Rule 52 of the -- but on a cognizance approach and a proper interpretation of such a basic and important right as preserving the right to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.539" offset="4161494">I'd like to address myself first to the suggestion that the Court need not reach the question of the effect of an untimely motion for new trial in this case because in the filing, within the 10-day period of a motion for bail which does amount to a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.709" offset="4242160">It is argued that the Court might and should find that in -- consistently with the spirit of the rules that this document which is on page 10 of the record does amount to a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.627" offset="4301928">The document recites that the defendant comes in person and moves the Court to fix a reasonable bail, pending a final determination, an appeal for final adjudication in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.655" offset="4358040">Now, the document doesn't contain several of the required elements of a notice of appeal as set out by the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.832" offset="4390745">But it does contain we believe the one significant essential element and that is declaration in writing, in a writing filed with the court of the intention to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.062" offset="4439646">The other elements such as the settings, and the place of confinement, and the name of the case and the name of the lawyer, name of the lawyer was in this one, do not at all affect the substance of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.319" offset="4492622">Those are obviously understood by the Government and the case and by the law -- by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.312" offset="4516655">The essential element of a notice of appeal we believe is the declaration of an intention to appeal within the 10-day period, and that was clearly done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.999" offset="4555316">The lower courts have, on numerous occasions, treated documents which don't amount to notices of appeal as formerly amounting notices of appeal -- as notices of appeal, because they have contained that single element of a declaration of an intention to appeal, letters, informal letters written to the court or to the clerk by prisoners have been deemed to be notices of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.643" offset="4729919">We can't see any prejudice which would occur to the Government, to the -- to defendants or to the fair administration of the system if these were deemed to be a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.724" offset="4778297">On the other hand, we think it is a little inconsistent with that -- with the rules to demand all the precise requisites of a notice of appeal as set out in the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.992" offset="4815391">And we do note that the new rules cut down on those required elements a little bit which seems to be consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.107" offset="4843813">Some of the -- the new rules require that the notice of appeals -- of appeals should specify the party taking the appeal, the judgment order apart thereof appealed from, and shall name the court to which the appeal is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.810" offset="4918627">It doesn't require the place of confinement, for example, of the address of the lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.011" offset="7227434">We think that the -- the provision in the new rules that an untimely notice of appeal has no effect has been the rule, is indeed it has been in five of the six circuits, which have considered it since 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.358" offset="7272782">It was the Rule before 1946 without any doubt exclusively and it's the only Rule that makes any sense because if you held that an untimely motion for a new trial tolled the time for appeal, then you would have a rule which said that a -- only frivolous document of argument didn't make, didn't have any impact, would have an impact for the purpose of extending the time to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.703" offset="7370167">This is contrary to the motion which this Court has repeated many times that you can't enlarge times to appeal by taking frivolous useless steps below and that's what you do here if you filed an untimely motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.175" offset="7420113">I would like to address myself to one last intention with regard to that issue which we don't think you ought to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.971" offset="7447280">And that is the suggestion that in some way defendants would be prejudiced by their reliance on the plain words of the Rule by filing an untimely motion for new trial and then assuming that they would get 10 days from the denial of that time to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.435" offset="7521155">It seems that you -- defendant can properly rely upon the words of the Rules because if he read the rules, he knows that the motion for new trial is untimely when he files it on the ninth day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.838" offset="7562742">The only way he could fail to know that is that he only read the rules about time to appeal and didn't bring the rule about the motion for new trial which seems to be unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.798" offset="7594611">So if he reads the rules, he knows that on the ninth day when he files his motion for new trial that's untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.321" offset="7616658">It doesn't seem to me he can honestly think that that is going to prolong his time to do anything else because that itself is an untimely act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.914" offset="7647065">Secondly, there's no reliance in this case upon any court decisions construing the rule because the Sixth Circuit which is where this case wrote had a decision squarely in point holding that an untimely note -- motion for new trial does not extend the time to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.756" offset="7706415">And thirdly, there isn't any reliance in this case such as you had in the Harris case or the Thompson case arising under the rules of civil procedure where the Court held where a defendant relies upon an affirmative Act of the District Court or the Government taken within the initial time to appeal and doesn't file his appeal because that Act signifies to him that he has more time than he shouldn't be prejudiced by that reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.100" offset="7807770">But in this case, there's no such reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.213" offset="7816234">The District Court did nothing during a 10-day period to suggest to the defendant that he would not have more time nor did the Government do anything within the 10-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.911" offset="7851029">So, it doesn't seem to us that there is in any sense any reliance here, and indeed there couldn't be any reliance in any case unless there had been such an affirmative Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.895" offset="7886973">For those reasons we think that the decision of the Court of Appeals below that an untimely motion for new trial does not extend the time if it was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.076" offset="7919679">But we believe that there was a timely notice of appeal in this case that is the motion for bond on page 10 of the record and that the appropriate course would be to vacate the decision below and remand to the Court of Appeals, to hear the appeal on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1981.325" offset="8028662">I would repeat that I think both grounds for reversal are solid substantial grounds and I don't think either requires or submit any denial or reversal or restriction of the current rules or the proposed rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.986" offset="8095326">It seems to me in the first place that Rule 37 very plainly sets forth what the time is to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.385" offset="8132942">And that the reliance of counsel in this case upon Rule 37 was almost induced by the very exceptionally clear language of Rule 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.640" offset="8177977">The fiction that every person is presumed under the law or even every lawyers presumed under the law is just that, a fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.232" offset="8212250">In this case, a lawyer did precisely do that and I don't believe that the unhappy client should be made to suffer for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.513" offset="8249448">The fiction that the lawyer must have known about, the DeRocco decision in the Sixth Circuit is also I submit merely a fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.067" offset="8291662">The language again does not conflict with Rule 33 in any but a literary sense for the reasons I gave earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.936" offset="8335130">I don't think that the Government has yet stated any disagreement with the policy which I find in the rules on decisions of this Court and that is that direct appeals are to be favored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.455" offset="8381210">And I want to add simply one citation of authority if I may on the point the Government raises, that the notice -- that the motion for bond should be considered a notice for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.766" offset="8426454">That is to this Court's decision in the Coppedge case, it's not cited in either brief, I'm sorry to say, is 369 U.S. 438.</text>

            <text syncTime="2096.101" offset="8487790">At Footnote 5 of that decision on page 442, the Court indicates that it favors a liberal view of papers filed by an incarcerated defendant in a criminal case and cites perfectly all the cases cited by the Government with the apparent favor and I thus disagree with counsel for the Government that this is at least not today a new invention that has persisted for some time, it was recognized with this Court in the Coppedge case and I think is wholly consistent and wholly faithful to particularly Rules 2 and Rule 52.</text>
