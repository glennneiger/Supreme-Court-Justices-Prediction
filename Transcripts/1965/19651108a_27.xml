            <label>Mr. Charles W. Decker</label>
            <text syncTime="37.002" offset="251382">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.065" offset="271653">The parties to this litigation are my clients, a railroad worker named Fred Gunther, who lives in San Diego, California, and his employer, or ex-employer, the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.637" offset="357961">For the purposes of clarity in my remarks, I'm going to refer to Mr. Gunther as the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.257" offset="396413">He is the only petitioner before the Court and I will refer to the respondent, San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway Company, rather than by that long name as the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.440" offset="469138">Before I recite briefly the background, upon which the question before the Court is predicated, I think I will allude briefly to the issue because I think that that will clarify our approach to the whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.082" offset="559731">I take it to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.739" offset="566314">We're not concerned here with the narrow question as to whether or not there was a factual question for trial before the judge in the District Court at the time he granted the respondent's motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.170" offset="644054">I think I'm entitled to assume and I certainly urge that a larger question presents itself to the Court because of the unique aspect of the case, not being one where a plaintiff is pursuing an ordinary civil remedy or a common law remedy, but a case where the petitioner is suing pursuant to Section 153 (p) of Title 45 of the United States Code to enforce an award of the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.732" offset="822314">That was the nature of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.327" offset="844675">And so the larger question it seems to me is, did the District Court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals respond to that petition in a manner consistent with congressional purpose and with the policy underlying our labor laws when it chose to interpret the collective bargaining agreement in a manner contrary to the way it had been interpreted by the National Railroad Adjustment Board and on the basis of that to grant summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.573" offset="1045713">I see the light is --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="236.258" offset="1048430">We'll recess now Mr. Decker.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles W. Decker</label>
            <text syncTime="243.060" offset="1075597">That the judicial remedy provided by Section 153 (p) of Title 45 is of extreme importance to the railroad worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.523" offset="1133484">If he goes, takes his grievance or his claim to the Railroad Adjustment Board as is his right under the Railway Labor Act and if that claim is sustained, he wins his case before the board, and then because the award is not self-enforcing, if his employer refuses to comply with that award, he has only one place to go for relief and that's the District Court under Section 153 (p).</text>
            <text syncTime="303.120" offset="1315819">Obviously, this is an important remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.599" offset="1341733">Now, to get to the background of this particular case, my client, Mr. Gunther has worked for the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway Company for many, many years, most of it as an engineer so that by 1954, he was the most senior engineer and the employee of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.496" offset="1441311">During that time, he was General Chairman for the Brotherhood of Locomotive Fireman and Engineman, a standard railway organization which up until 1958, as I recall, held the contract on the property for firemen and hostlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.098" offset="1531800">It can be presumed then that during this time he was participating in enforcing and applying that collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.324" offset="1592717">In 1953, on December 8, as a matter of fact, of 1953, Mr. Gunther became 70 years of age and at that time, although in the past he'd only been required to take a physical examination once a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.945" offset="1683101">The company required him to start taking physical examinations each three months, which he did without anything untoward occurring until the last such examination which occurred on December 15, 1954 or thereabouts, at which time he was informed by his employer that the company doctors did not consider that he was physically fit to continue in service as a railroad engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.668" offset="1810056">The findings of these physicians were reviewed by the chief surgeon in San Francisco and he advised, and it's in the record before the board as well as the court, that in his opinion, Mr. Gunther was likely to suffer an acute coronary episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.497" offset="1925308">On the basis of that, Mr. Gunther was taken out of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.818" offset="1942653">He immediately initiated and commenced the exhaustion of his administrative remedy and eventually his case wound up before the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.368" offset="2004825">There was an initial award in 1956 which established a three-doctor panel and a subsequent award or interpretation thereof in 1958, which on the basis of the reports of the physicians in the three-doctor panel established that Mr. Gunther should be reinstated to his position with back pay.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="506.777" offset="2130526">Is there any claim that the railroad examination or the examination by the railroad doctor was not a good faith determination?</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_w_decker" startTime="519.581" stopTime="679.195">
            <label>Mr. Charles W. Decker</label>
            <text syncTime="519.581" offset="2181726">This is not alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.573" offset="2193638">There's no such allegation in the petition and there was no such allegation in any of the affidavits before the court at the time when summary judgment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.700" offset="2286216">The award itself, I think we should take a look at, it's found at page 9 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.619" offset="2345880">The first award back in 1956, being on page 5 and then the interpretation on page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.256" offset="2388407">The Court will note that the board set out its findings initially saying that it is true that the carrier has the right and responsibility in determining within proper limits, the physical fitness of employees to remain in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.204" offset="2468237">It is true also that the employee has the right to priority in service according to his seniority and pursuant to the agreements so long as he is physically qualified, where these two rights come in to collision, it is consistently been held by this division that it has jurisdiction to determine whether the employee has wrongfully been deprived of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.258" offset="2564368">The Board then goes on to point out that since the determination of the facts necessary to enable the division to make an award on this issue requires medical confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.934" offset="2607104">It finds that a three-doctor panel should be established and concludes if the decision of the majority of such Board shall support the decision of the carrier's chief surgeon, the claim will be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.930" offset="2667081">If not, it will be sustained with pay pursuant to rule on the property from October 15, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.522" offset="2697488">Now, the event, excuse me, the events that transpired after that, of course were that a neutral physician was appointed that is the carrier did comply with the award to the extent of cooperating in the establishment of a three-doctor panel but when that neutral doctor's report was in, the carrier chose to interpret his findings as being supporting those of its chief surgeon rather than being contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="680.379" offset="2824861">Going back for a moment again to the original order on page 5, is it your understanding that the division of the board in the language that you read to us has followed that policy in that way doing things without regard at all to any collective bargaining agreement on the property?</text>

            <text syncTime="704.263" offset="2920469">I can not answer that question sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.929" offset="2935097">I -- there is not in the record but there was before the appellate court, a whole host of decisions by the Adjustment Board setting up three-doctor panels of this kind and there are reports in the federal reporting system indicating that this has happened in the past.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="726.167" offset="3008031">Of course he's right is a priority, seniority rights necessarily depend upon the collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.725" offset="3038229">So to that extent the second sentence on the third from the last paragraph on page 6 necessarily refers to the collective bargaining agreement, was it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_w_decker" startTime="746.392" stopTime="746.621">
            <label>Mr. Charles W. Decker</label>
            <text syncTime="746.392" offset="3088906">That's right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="746.621" stopTime="749.481">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="746.621" offset="3089847">Without the agreement he would not have any seniority rights?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_w_decker" startTime="749.481" stopTime="816.565">
            <label>Mr. Charles W. Decker</label>
            <text syncTime="749.481" offset="3101341">Yes, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.605" offset="3105834">Except sir, I would like to note that what is the agreement is perhaps the question for the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.167" offset="3132061">The problem has existed in this case throughout has been that the court has considered that the only evidence, evidentiary source for the agreement between the brotherhood and Railroad in this case is this document right here which bears on its face, the legend that it's the rules effective March 1, 1935 revised rates of pay effective October something, October 30 I think it is 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.944" offset="3271137">So the question as to what the agreement is, we contend is before the court it was -- and that properly the Board has the right to look elsewhere than within the framework of this document, the green covers of this document to determine what the underlying rights and duties of the parties are.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="816.565" offset="3369671">What puzzled me about this order as in connection with what happened afterwards was simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.010" offset="3403421">That this order, it seems to be is tied to the agreement in so far as, it correctly says that this petitioner has certain seniority rights to remain on the job, and it furthers says that he can not be deprived of those rights in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.497" offset="3469354">There's a reference to a good faith with which I suppose the carrier would agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.191" offset="3500178">But then from then on the interpretation didn't make any reference at all of good faith or bad faith, it simply superseded the carrier's doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.224" offset="3552319">Those carrier's doctors have professional judgment with the professional judgment of three other doctors and no reference to bad faith and there was no further reference that I could find in the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_w_decker" startTime="872.652" stopTime="968.229">
            <label>Mr. Charles W. Decker</label>
            <text syncTime="872.652" offset="3594010">That's true sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.852" offset="3598817">Now, I want to read this language though in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.793" offset="3618565">If carrier through its medical staff has removed an employee from service in good faith on the basis of a fair standard of fitness applied to his physical condition adequately determined is more than just a problem of good faith here.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.748" offset="3690350">And I take it that the subsequent determination by the board, that the man should be reinstated with bad faith constitutes an implied finding by the Board that on the basis of the reports of the neutral position that perhaps the physical fitness of Mr. Gunther had not been adequately determined by the company or it had not applied a fairly standard of fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.817" offset="3834650">Continuing then the -- in 1958 this open ended award was made affine.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.533" offset="3873520">And the Board said the issue of fact upon which the prior award was conditioned having been determined in favor of claimant said conditional award should be made absolute and final and the claim sustained as therein provided, and then it went ahead with its award and order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1082.099" offset="4431809">It was a standard practice before the Humphreys case in 1963 for the Railroad Organizations to enforce awards by threat of strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.586" offset="4489697">This could account for the lapse of two years almost between the time the 58 award was made and the time the petition was filed in the San Diego court, the second time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.789" offset="4598575">Initially, the respondent, the carrier without answers simply filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that this was the agreement, there's nothing in here limiting the employer's right to determine the physical fitness of his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.359" offset="4676838">Therefore on theory there, the Board's jurisdiction is limited to the interpretation on application of existing agreements and this is the agreement, the claim was thought.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles W. Decker</label>
            <text syncTime="1275.702" offset="5206183">The agreement read as a whole has enormous gaps in it and one of the examples it seems to me of the type of agreement it is as being a unique instrument and something quite different than we ran across in industry, labor industry contracts other than the rail industry, is the fact that there would be absolutely nothing in it at all about what a man's rights are, specifically, what a man's rights are to in the event he's found not to be physically qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.161" offset="5359992">There's not even any provision in there for this yearly examination that was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.639" offset="5389876">This, I simply refer to fortify my argument that a reasonable construction of this agreement requires resort to extrinsic evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.036" offset="5463542">The District Court said in its opinion that the board should have interpreted the agreement the way I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.243" offset="5496351">The Court of Appeals said in its opinion that the board has exceeded its jurisdiction obviously inferring that it had accepted the proposition that the board's jurisdiction was limited to the interpretation and application of documents and that it did not find in this document any limitation upon the employer's right to determine the physical fitness of its employees therefore it disagreed with the board, the board's award was ultra virus and should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.292" offset="5668551">Now, I don't have much time and I want to get to the issue, was this summary disposition of the petition in this case consistent with congressional purpose, when it enacted the compulsory arbitration scheme for the disposition of disputes arising out of grievances, and out of the interpretation and application of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.066" offset="5803656">May I call the Court's attention to the fact that the jurisdictional grant in the Railway Labor Act does not limit the board's jurisdiction to the interpretation and application of agreements, it confers upon the board jurisdiction to determine disputes arising out of grievances and out of the interpretation and application of agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.793" offset="5934582">Since I filed the petitioner's brief in this case and today I've had occasion to concern myself somewhat more with the issue before the Court in terms of scope of review and in that connection, I have noticed Judge Frankfurter's reference to the fact that when the Railway Labor Act was amended in 1934 to provide for compulsory arbitrations, Congress chose to use the language which was a part of what is now Section 16 (2) of Title 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.004" offset="6107408">This is the provision for enforcement of reparation orders made by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.689" offset="6146173">If the Court will refer to that Section, it will see that the language in the Railway Labor Act, Section 153 (p) which refers to the mode of enforcement is taken from the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.896" offset="6270934">I'm referring now to the language which says that the petition shall proceed, and that is the suit on the petition, shall proceed in all respects as other civil suits and the order of the Division Adjustment Boards of the prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.628" offset="6361840">Now in 1889 when the Erdman Act being came the law, the predecessor of the present Interstate Commerce Act, the Congress was very much concerned about the constitutional limitations, it might impose upon the power of an administrative agency to grant money judgments and consequently, it placed in the enforcement section of the Act having to do with reparation orders and what should happen to them after they're made by the commission that the suit was to proceed as in all respects as a civil suit and a jury trial was to be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.609" offset="6561834">And then in 1906, when the Hepburn Act was adopted amending the original Interstate Commerce Act, the reference to a jury trial was deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.695" offset="6618154">I take it that we can infer from congressional record that what Congress was trying to do was to create an administrative agency which could make a reparation order which would be enforceable in court and providing for review in the enforcing court only to the extent that the constitution required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.750" offset="6738422">Now it's my opinion based upon my study of the congressional record that this undoubtedly is the most reasonable explanation for what Congress intended in 1934 when it chose this language to use in describing the nature of the proceeding to be had in an enforcement action of awards from Railway Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.401" offset="6857017">I call the Court's attention to the testimony before the Senate Committee of Congress in connection with this Bill proposed amendment to the Railway Labor Act, wherein --</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.654" offset="7290023">This case involves a question which we believe is an extremely important one when one considers as the Court of Appeals points out in its decision that the railroad has a prime responsibility with respect to its operations in interstate commerce and as we well know with respect to its own employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.808" offset="7426591">The railroad as is conceded in the petitioner's brief and in his argument has the -- has had a rule over a period of years and as his brief concedes that has not been in the collective bargaining agreement which rule requires its engineers who will operate locomotives and trains to take a physical examination at periodic intervals to determine their qualification to perform that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.080" offset="7579669">Mr. Gunther, the petitioner over the years recognizing that rule and at the same time as counsel has pointed out being a general chairman of the fireman's organization reported to those physical examinations and passed them over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.245" offset="7660335">The rule requires that if one becomes age 70; he must take such a physical every 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.491" offset="7689383">This he did and on about the fifth examination, shortly after age 71, the carrier's physicians found that there was some condition of his heart from which it could be supposed or predicted that he might have an arterial coronary episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.855" offset="7794813">As has been pointed out here, there's been no charge from the beginning of this case to now that the carrier acted in bad faith or that the carrier's doctors in making their examinations acted in bad faith or in fact in any way other than in utmost good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.736" offset="7874330">Thereafter, the matter was reviewed in San Francisco and the findings were confirmed and Mr. Gunther then contended that his rights under the collective bargaining agreement had been violated his seniority right, his seniority right, a right predicated on an agreement provision preventing layoff and a right predicated upon agreement provision providing for investigation upon dismissals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.085" offset="8023751">Now a question arose here -- I might state that that argument was presented to the carrier as is required under Section 3 First (i) and thereafter, after being handled on the property was presented in the same manner to the adjustment board as it appears in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2599.441" offset="10501099">Now my opponent said that there was a green pamphlet that covered the man's rights as of 1938 and therefore as of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.679" offset="10550105">We've demonstrated in our brief as I think the lower courts have pointed out that the 1938 agreement was not believed necessarily to be the whole agreement if somebody would point to a provision which restricted the right of the carrier to follow his doctor's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.915" offset="10639026">In other words, if the petitioner had at any point, pointed to any evidence of such a provision or pointed to any evidence of a three-doctor panel arbitration prior to 1959 that would have been taken into account and the court in fact made several invitations to the petitioner to do so and he did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.000" offset="10739336">So that the court did not limit it to the green booklet, as a matter of fact a testimony of -- and the affidavits of Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers general chairman on the motion under Rule 60 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.850" offset="10802761">And I believe earlier in that case, it was pointed out that petitioner was familiar with the agreement with Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers agreement in that he represented other engineers on the property in asserting their rights under the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.563" offset="10897638">And that he would be therefore fully familiar with it and that comes about because the general chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Fireman and Engineman, under the statute has the right to represent anybody in the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.000" offset="10947375">Whether they'd be engineers or fireman and if they are members of his organization as is permitted under the Railway Labor Act because it's an organization national in scope admitting to membership both engineers and fireman, why, he could do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.943" offset="11019160">Now, he was familiar with the agreement and yet, he didn't and couldn't point to any provision other than those that seniority, layoff and discharge for cause that have been mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.304" offset="11396577">And that was a change made pursuant to the Section 6 of the Railway Labor Act which provides a method for changing agreements.</text>
