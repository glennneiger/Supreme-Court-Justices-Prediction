            <text syncTime="38.975" offset="260347">These cases are on appeal from a statutory three-judge District Court which had dismissed the complaint of the plaintiffs who sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction against the enforcement and administration of the Virginia poll tax laws which require a payment of certain sums of money as a prerequisite to voting in state and local elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.062" offset="352611">The plaintiffs based their suit on a Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.226" offset="381346">The State in its motion to dismiss and answer challen -- defended the constitutionality of the -- of the poll tax laws to challenge the con -- the standing of the plaintiffs to bring the suit on the ground that by their own admissions, they constituted a class which was ineligible to both under Virginia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.231" offset="461281">The plaintiffs had alleged that though they were qualified in every respect to both under the Virginia statutes, they lack the financial means to pay the poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.211" offset="509241">And if by their poverty they were therefore deprived the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.442" offset="530139">The State's argument was that the plaintiffs fell within the class of persons known as paupers who are disqualified under Virginia law from voting as are other classes such as idiots, insane persons, persons convicted of certain crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.567" offset="602655">The District Court dismissed the case after hearing it on the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and on the State's motion for a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.910" offset="648004">The District Court decided the case on the basis of this Court's decision in 1937 in Breedlove v. Suttles which had sustained the constitutionality of a Georgia poll tax requirement substantially similar to the one in -- now existing in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.633" offset="718952">The Court also dismissed the plaintiff's challenge to the pauper disqualification on the ground that there was no showing that it had been applied to deprive the plaintiffs of the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.721" offset="767331">And that they therefore were without standing to challenge this provision of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.604" offset="882792">It -- well it has never been applied because there -- the poll tax has served as an effective deterrent or bar to voting by purpose -- persons falling in that class of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.930" offset="924066">The poll tax in the Virginia is a $1.50 payable three -- six months prior to the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.634" offset="958966">A person who has lived in the State for more than three years must pay -- for three years or more must pay the tax cumulatively to -- and if he has never paid it, he must -- or has paid it made delinquents payments, he must pay penalty and interest charges which are added to the poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.586" offset="1030750">So that as in the case of these four appellants in this proceeding, in order to register and qualify themselves to vote and to cast their first ballot in Virginia, none of them have ever voted, they would have to pay a maximum of individually of $5.01.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.174" offset="1101072">Two of the plaintiffs are husband and wife and from their household budget it would require a payment of $10.02 in order for them to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.451" offset="1146211">The plaintiff's first argument is that this disqualificaton or that that -- that is that this financial requirement serves as a bar to voting for paupers, indigents, poor people, persons who are of the class which -- from which plaintiffs -- which plaintiffs here represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.939" offset="1232102">This Court in the case decided last term, Harman v. Forssenius commented on the well-known fact that the -- the truck, the disenfranchisement of the poor is occasioned by the failure to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.592" offset="1294796">The tax not only disenfranchised the persons without any means but persons who are below the level of economic income where there the -- the question of paying a tax represents a choice between the necessities of life, food, clothing, shelter, medicine, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.220" offset="1369297">The census figures for 1960 showed that 28% of all Virginia families had incomes in 1959 of below $3,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.143" offset="1412974">This was the -- this is the level that is currently recognized in governmental circles as representing the -- the boundary of poverty, the upper boundary of poverty, $3,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.145" offset="1572948">So it's plain that the -- there is a -- invidious discrimination against poor people here in the same sense that this Court has previously spoken out in the cases of Griffin v. Illinois and Douglas against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.662" offset="1627073">Those cases were ones in which the Court held in criminal proceedings at least that the Court could not be discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.629" offset="1658943">And as the Court said in the Douglas case -- in the Griffin case, excuse me, "A state can no more discriminate on account of poverty than on account of religion, race, or color."</text>
            <text syncTime="402.628" offset="1714949">The Court also made clear in subsequent cases, Reynolds against Sims, Gray against Sanders, for example, that this same principle or the same principle of economic discrimination is equally applicable in cases involving voting rights; that similarly persons may not be discriminated against on the basis of their class including economic class.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.385" offset="1809930">The discriminatory scheme of the Virginia laws also -- Virginia poll tax laws, also results in arbitrary and unreasonable classifications of other classes of persons who are potential voters in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.742" offset="1863325">The three-year cumulative requirement or -- and the requirement that persons pay six months prior to the election, all result in disqualifications of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.551" offset="1906584">In addition, there are a number of provisions which permit the exemptions from paying the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.032" offset="1932497">And there are several classes of persons who may vote in the State without paying any tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.615" offset="1954858">This results in equal -- the denial of equal protection laws to those persons who must pay the tax vis-à-vis those who do not need to.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.281" offset="2597470">In Campbell against Goode, a case in which the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia had construed this law, the Court admitted that the purpose of the poll tax was not to limit the -- not to raise revenue but rather to limit the right of suffrage to those who took sufficient interest in the affairs of the State to qualify themselves to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.524" offset="2682525">And the States read to this Court, it is also a numerous, in several instances, repeated this same kind of rationale as a basis for the poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.989" offset="2720350">It is stated for example on pages 43 and 46 of the brief that the simplest and most equal nondiscriminatory that the tax is, the simplest, most equal nondiscriminatory and objective test of minimum intelligence and responsibility that could be reva -- be devised.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.242" offset="2789313">In another point on page 38 of its brief, it refers to the tax as an elementary and objective intelligence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.732" offset="2819302">It all talks -- also talks about it being a simple and objective test of minimum capacity for ordering one's affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.626" offset="2846887">Now, we submit that this type of rationale simply does not bear scrutiny or it is plain that if these are -- are the very nature of a tax, poor people are going to be discriminated against and is going to be disqualified for voting and this -- their failure to pay the tax is not in anyway established by -- it does not in any way establish their lack of responsibility as citizens due to their lack of intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.937" offset="2956184">The exemptions also suggest that the tax in no way is a test of intelligence or responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.277" offset="2993486">I also call the Court's attention to the fact that if there is a provision of the tax -- of the state code, Section 24-129, which has not been referred to in any of the briefs but which permits a member of a -- a person to have his tax paid by a member of his household or his immediate family.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.585" offset="3074779">Thus, as it's true in many families, the person who pays the bills pays the tax for the other members of the family, the spouse for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="781.825" offset="3231723">This is one of its principal defense -- defenses to voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.719" offset="3251263">It argues this on the basis of construction of the language of Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution which appears to or which does states -- the States may establish the qualifications for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.478" offset="3298283">However, we state, to serve one that the poll tax is not a qualification in the -- in the literal sense of the word and that therefore it should not be barred that is a decision holding it unconstitutional is not barred by this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.854" offset="3359828">Secondly, we submit that this Court has really dispose in large measure of the State's argument on this Court because in the cases decided last term Carrington against Rash involving the Texas serviceman, Louisiana versus the United States and in -- of the earlier case of Lassiter versus Northampton Board of Elections, this Court has made clear that the Fourteenth Amendment, at the very least, does apply to voting rights and that these voting requirements will be subject -- subjected to examination in light of the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.103" offset="3512801">Not only, therefore, does the Equal Protection Clause established a basis for this Court's decision but we further believe that voting here must also be looked at as being one that had -- we believe that the Due Process Clause demands the same result that is that the poll tax is unconstitutional as a prerequisite to voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.461" offset="3602244">For example, as this Court has made clear the very fundamental and basic and essential nature of the right to vote, the right to vote, therefore, may not be -- may not be taken away, may not be impaired by requirements which have no relevancy to the maintenance of -- to the State's interest rather in having an informed electorate and having efficient and well run electoral process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.844" offset="4171818">As we pointed out in our brief, Virginia is not the only state with a poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.816" offset="4187700">There are three -- there are four other states in the United States that have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.006" offset="4208389">Three of these are in the south and one of them is the State of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.300" offset="4225630">Vermont -- the Vermont poll tax law has a provision which suggests that the Court's ruling in here in the basis on which the Board, the Court makes its ruling may have ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.694" offset="4283204">The poll tax in Vermont, for example, ranges from a minimum of $3.50 to a maximum of $18 as a prerequisite to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.448" offset="4326149">In addition, there is a $5 old-age assistance tax which is tucked on to that which must also be paid as a prerequisite to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.050" offset="4360631">Now, this is not in all elections but only in town meetings, town elections, and school district elections in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.617" offset="4390828">The Vermont tax unlike that in Virginia has an exemption for persons “actually poor”, also for persons receiving old-age assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.214" offset="4441297">We, therefore, have suggested that the basis for the Court's ruling will have significance here and that the Equal Protection Clause alone for example if the -- if the basis for the Court's ruling is at the Equal Protection Clause applies because in Virginia because it deprives paupers of the right to vote, the poor persons have the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.957" offset="4528232">This may not reach the type of tax that exists in Vermont or the kind of tax which could be enacted in Virginia or some other state that is if they were to incorporate an exemption for paupers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.348" offset="4577761">Now, we believe that even a pauper exemption if were established is a -- one had to take it as a prerequisite to voting would be an unconstitutional irrational burden on the exercise of the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.194" offset="4633140">But we have suggested in our brief that any -- any tax even if there is a pauper extension -- exemption is unconstitutional because it's irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.281" offset="4685490">And as in the case of Murdock against Pennsylvania, for example, it constitutes a burden or a restraint, a prior restraint, a suppression on the exercise of a fundamental right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.008" offset="5152455">Our answer to that is, one, there was never any need to apply it because the poll tax served as a -- as a bar to voting by persons who are poor or paupers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.165" offset="5197072">Secondly, we believe this provision should be held unconstitutional because it is a self-enforcing provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1440.321" offset="5865702">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.493" offset="5882420">The United States appears in this case because of the great importance that our government attaches to the whole problem and while the poll tax is today in full force only in four states, Virginia Alabama, Mississippi and Texas; and secondly, by virtue of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment applies only to state elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.699" offset="5991194">It remains a serious clog in the exercise of the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.418" offset="6014077">What is more, the problem of the poll tax is a real value to voting has become more not less acute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.211" offset="6041245">And the reason is that with the removal of most of the restrictions by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it's pretty clear that the poll tax is going to be the one weapon left remaining and then it will come into its full position, I assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.539" offset="6126508">And there's another aspect to the urgency of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.866" offset="6143854">And I have some hesitation and to mention it in this case which across the laws only in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.934" offset="6172170">But after all the ruling here may well govern elsewhere and the Court should know the realities of the situation, the fact is that many thousands of persons in Alabama and Mississippi registered for the first time under the 1965 Act, whether through the regular state registrars or federal examiners, most of them simply did not pay their poll taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.478" offset="6282303">And these states unlike Virginia, payment of poll tax is not a prerequisite to registration but it's only a prerequisite to voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.428" offset="6318143">And of course if the tax, the poll tax is the constitutional, they will not be entitled to vote in the forthcoming general primaries in May in Alabama and June in Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.388" offset="6617924">Well, the other thing I would like to mention is that our position we wish to take in this case is broad as possibly could be considered whereas the petitioner in these cases are poor people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.509" offset="6678424">The argument, as we see it, would apply equally if the wealthiest person in Virginia had refused to pay his poll taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.109" offset="6712801">Our basic reason is that you cannot put a tax on the right to vote in any form or fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.235" offset="6749372">While considering the argument in this case I happened to be in New York, the strike, and I think my analogy -- my knowledge is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.788" offset="6787511">While a city can without question charge for writing on the municipal subway and put up a turnstile where you have to put in the 15 cent token, I don't believe anybody will try to support a plan where you had to put in a dime in a turnstile when you went into vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.511" offset="6882492">It just is completely opposed to any form of democratic government I can think of and this is even worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.972" offset="6920317">Because in Virginia, it would be bad enough if you had to pay the dollar and a half and buy a ticket before you went into vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.146" offset="6953023">But this you have to pay it six months in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.326" offset="6973712">And whereas some people normally get it on their tax bills, there are others that don't have tax bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.380" offset="7001924">And they don't know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.680" offset="7011119">And this I think the Court is aware of the fact that there's not too much interest in the election six months in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.717" offset="7047272">So I say my turnstile example is a position that even Virginia can't rely upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.700" offset="7083217">The -- your question immediately comes up as to how does that arise to a constitutional question was very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.779" offset="7115504">When our Constitution was drafted, it was drafted with the full realization that we want to have a government of the people, the republican form of government to be guaranteed and the basic rule set down for qualification of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.321" offset="7181646">But I'm sure the Constitution did not consider the possibility of a state not holding an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.780" offset="7211530">They assumed that the States would hold elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.149" offset="7221039">Indeed, they assumed that they would hold it unfairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.036" offset="7232533">And of course it was not until the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments and it was found necessary to lay down certain guiding rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.890" offset="7267955">I don't believe that this general principle that the States have is unqualified right to pick qualifications and how anyone can put a tax, the payment of a head tax as a qualification for voting is beyond me.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.370" offset="11841891">And in addition to that, if he's a good man and a responsible citizen, he's normally pardoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.198" offset="11869163">And his right to vote is restored but the failure to pay the poll tax for that year, there's no pardon involved in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.044" offset="11944605">The last point I would like to mention is that the State tried to justify this on the ground that it is a single and objective method of determining whether a prospective voter has enough interest and intelligence to be a fit participant in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.310" offset="12025584">And I think that point was taken cared of fully in the Harman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.355" offset="12049826">It's difficult to see how any tax charged upon the exercise of the franchise can ever be any good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.872" offset="12083890">And finally, nor can the poll tax be defended as a method of raising revenue for legitimate purposes of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.220" offset="12125268">And I merely mentioned that because the State put so much stress to it and completely ignore its own decisions and I think the facts as were brought out in a question earlier, demonstrate fully that there's no connection or whatsoever between the collection of the taxes and the voting itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.778" offset="12199560">And I would say that the United States Government pursuant to the 1965 Voting Act has appeared here as amicus with the strong urging of the Government that the poll tax involved in this case be declared unconstitutional once and for all so that the voters who got their rights for the first time in the 1965 Act can exercise in this year without any problem at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.060" offset="12588680">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.703" offset="12607175">Mrs. Evelyn Butts, the plaintiff and appellant in this case brought this action to have the laws of Virginia which require the payment of a poll tax or capitation tax declared in violation of the First, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.814" offset="12675615">This case was consolidated and tried in the Harper case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.203" offset="12693170">And after a hearing on the merits, the lower court dismissed the complaint largely on the authority of Breedlove versus Suttles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.096" offset="12728801">The facts in this case are established by the testimony of three witnesses for appellant as well as several exhibits which were introduced into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.244" offset="12769343">The testimony of the witnesses was summarized by appellant counsel and was entered into the record by stipulation, although neither the truth nor the relevancy of it was admitted by counsel for the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.603" offset="12818766">The first witness, Mrs. Butts, the plaintiff and appellant, testified that she lives with her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.390" offset="12845934">She has no income of her own and his sole support is a veteran's pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.718" offset="12863279">They make a home for their 15-year-old daughter and for her 90-year-old father.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.649" offset="12883028">She has voted in the past and she has paid the poll tax in the past although it was always an economic hardship upon her to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.352" offset="12909777">She's qualified to vote now except for payment of the tax which she has not recently accomplished because of the financial hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.549" offset="12938616">She desires to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.154" offset="12948961">The testimony of Mr. John Brooks, the plaintiff's second witness, was that he's a salaried employee of the NAACP; that he is personally engaged in voter registration and get out the vote rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.078" offset="13000683">And that he's attempted to get people to pay their poll tax in Virginia and to register and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.023" offset="13020536">And then on many occasions, people have told him that they could not register because they could not pay the poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.011" offset="13044464">And he's observed these people, their living conditions, their personal property, their dwelling houses, and he could testify that they, in fact, lived in poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.236" offset="13081349">The third and last witness for the appellant in the lower court was Professor Louis Ogden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.271" offset="13101516">Professor Ogden is from Eastern Kentucky University on the Political Science Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.166" offset="13121055">He's a well-known authority on the poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.666" offset="13131086">And his testimony was that he was familiar with the census figures with regard to income and population of Virginia which are made a part of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.925" offset="13168076">That he is aware of economic groupings and classes in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.109" offset="13184794">And that he believes based on his studies, the writings of others, from his personal investigation that the poll tax does in fact inhibit and deter a voting in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.536" offset="13234531">His testimony further was that he believes that proportionately, the Negro is twice as bad of income-wise as the white and therefore that the poll tax bears more harshly on the Negro than the white.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.736" offset="13295344">Plaintiff's attack as I stated before is under three amendments; the First, the Fourteenth, and the Fifteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.092" offset="13316765">We believe that Carrington versus Rash and prior cases have permanently established that a state's voting regulation is subject to the standards of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.401" offset="13362009">And our position is that while the right to vote, we believe, thus come from the State in fact that these cases have established, that it is subject to constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.047" offset="13404536">And we think that's beyond doubt at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.485" offset="13418329">We further believe that in our equal protection argument, this case is directly analogous to Griffin versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.875" offset="13451870">In the Griffin case, this Court held that the State of Illinois could not grant the right of appeal to all those accused and convicted of a crime and then in effect deny it to those too poor to pay for a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.341" offset="13505787">We believe there are three directly analogous points about the Griffin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.061" offset="13524595">First of all, in Griffin, the Court was dealing with the area of criminal regulation within a state, an area which is certainly peculiarly in the State's domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.338" offset="13569735">Just as in this case, we believe the setting of voting qualifications is peculiarly within a state domain, state's domain subject to constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.308" offset="13605679">Secondly, in Griffin, the fatal vice or defect which was pointed out was that there was no rational relationship between the ability to pay cost in advance in the innocence or guilt of an accused person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.523" offset="13662521">And in this case, appellant believes and as has been pointed out before here, there is no relationship between the ability to use the ballot and the ability to pay a poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.663" offset="13703064">The element that is lacking here is exactly the element that was present in Lassiter versus Northampton where this Court held that a literacy test or some relation to standards designed to deal with the intelligent use of the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.360" offset="13769832">Well, we believe finally that in Griffin, another analogous point is that the Court, we feel went out of it's way to point out that it was not holding that the right of appeal was itself essential to due process in that case but rather that once having selected a group who have the right of appeal, the State could not in effect then deny it to those too poor to pay for the perfection of a procedural step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.278" offset="13857499">Just so here, appellant does not urge that Virginia must grant the right to vote to all people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.195" offset="13877144">We believe the State has the right to select those who are reasonably qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.650" offset="13895011">But we insist that once having selected the group of people who are going to vote on the basis of reasonable, logical, and rational qualifications, he cannot then, under the guise of another qualification, deny that right to the people who are too poor to pay for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.090" offset="14100752">We believe the Virginia tax has other infirmaries in addition to this problem of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.840" offset="14123739">And that is this, the tax provisions are so inherently unreasonable as to themselves amount to denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.850" offset="14163759">The requirement of the tax to be paid six months in advance at a time when nobody's interest in an election is high when the candidates are not out on the stomp and when people are just generally not concerned is itself an unreasonable administrative requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.846" offset="14227811">The three year accumulation requirement adds to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.041" offset="14248605">The fact that there is no uniform method of assessment in Virginia so that those who own sufficient property of one kind or another to be taxed, get a tax notice also make it have built for the poll tax, and those who do not own sufficient property will not get billed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.692" offset="14303148">And finally, the final step in this ridiculous picture is the fact that by constitutional provision, the State of Virginia is forbidden from collecting the poll tax by legal process for three years after he's become due or in short until the tax has cease to affect anybody's right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.886" offset="14371903">We feel we've taken together these administrative steps amount to the fact that as the Government so aptly stated in its brief quoting from a case the tax represents a trap, not a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.994" offset="14424357">We think that it amounts to a denial of liberty without due process of law because there's no rational justification for these administrative steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.240" offset="14457375">The tax is certainly not a revenue measure as that term is normally understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.336" offset="14473780">First place all of these provisions are designed to discourage the collection of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.282" offset="14489558">Secondly, the highest Court of Virginia has expressedly stated that it's not to raise revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.978" offset="14508262">The justification that the taxes for the purpose of seeing whether a person is interested enough in qualifying himself to vote, in our opinion, simply does not hold water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.901" offset="14547968">For one thing, it assumes that everybody who wants to vote can afford to pay the tax; something which we believe simply is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.011" offset="14580464">Secondly, if there was any validity to the test idea here, it could be accomplished simply enough without the payment of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.642" offset="14614946">The payment of a tax is unnecessary there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.869" offset="14627903">So we believe when taken together, all of these procedural steps themselves amount to a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.288" offset="14661548">Now, there are many census figures which we have included in the record through exhibits which rendered additional to testimony that was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.467" offset="14694254">And we believe that the record establishes three main facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.629" offset="14714943">One that there is great poverty in Virginia; secondly, that poverty is worst among the Negro people than the white people, and finally that the poll tax does inhibit and deter a voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.824" offset="14763739">And I'm not going in one of those statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.933" offset="14772099">I must ask too because some of them have been quoted before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.759" offset="14787459">I might just mention one to give an idea of the nature and gravity of the problem in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.089" offset="14808775">In this 1960 federal census dealing with the year 1959 in a table which included the incomes of people over 14 years of age, the great majority moreover 21, in Virginia there were 800,000 people without income and 1,900,000 with income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.846" offset="14887769">Now, that 1,900,000 approximately 1,125,000 earn less than $3,000, a figure which has been designated by several governmental agency as the income level below which a family is living in poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.247" offset="14949418">The statistics could go on and on to show the numbers of people that are earning income at this bare subsistence level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.983" offset="14984317">Similarly, as to the comparison of the Negro people and the white people, there are many statistics which indicate that relatively the Negro is almost proportionally twice as badly off as the whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.069" offset="15048683">It was quoted before where families were broken down on the census, 22% of the whites earn less than $3,000, 54% of the Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.264" offset="15085464">And it goes on adding some items if we compare those statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.222" offset="15101241">Finally, as far as the tax actually inhibiting voting, we rely on the testimony of Professor Ogden, and acknowledged experts on the tax as well as on the fact that this Court does not need an expert witness to tell if that person cannot afford three meals a day, he is going to think twice about paying for the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.111" offset="15180863">And of course, the administrative provisions that we have talked about resulting to disenfranchise of -- disenfranchising of many people even those who could normally afford to pay the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3848.303" offset="15497571">Going back historically, the poll tax was originally a liberal departure from the property holding qualification for voting which was being discussed before I begin to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.857" offset="15543860">Harvard -- at the time of the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1902, there'd be no question that the poll tax was merely one of many ways which were considered in order to disenfranchise the Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.956" offset="15588268">In fact this Court as recently as Harman versus Forssenius this year, it so stated that the Virginia poll tax was born of a desire to disenfranchise the Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.818" offset="15631632">Now, our position is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.523" offset="15642499">It's not hard to understand why an economic weapon was one of those chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.751" offset="15659426">Historically, the Negro had emerged from slavery after the civil war without property and with small economic means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.579" offset="15686698">His position has been slowly improved and has been slowly improved until the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.551" offset="15702580">In 1902, the framers of the Virginia Constitutional Convention on the poll tax realized that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.653" offset="15731001">And they had in mind the elimination of the Negro as a significant political group and we feel this is demonstrated by several quotes in our brief from the convention itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.857" offset="15767782">And they picked an economic weapon because they knew this would be a disenfranchising weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.103" offset="15788784">We believe that the fact that this is what they set out to do plus the fact that the statistics, the statistical evidence, bears out the fact that Negroes are significantly in a major way worse off than whites income-wise and have been so historically means that the tax as it was intended bears more harshly on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.621" offset="15874884">And we say that it doesn't make any difference that it may disenfranchise a lot of whites at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.369" offset="15893901">The purpose was to eliminate the Negro and we feel that it's dominant.</text>

            <text syncTime="4077.128" offset="16412902">As we read Breedlove, it decided three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.376" offset="16425859">It decided there was no violation of the Nineteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.292" offset="16441532">It decided that voting was not a privilege or immunity of United States citizenship under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment neither of which points until we dispute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.882" offset="16487926">And under the Equal Protection Clause, it decided that the exemptions for women and for this -- for women who do not register to vote and for people over 60 were not unreasonable if the State could do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.995" offset="16536409">The attack on the Equal Protection Clause in that case was in effect that if you tax us, you have to tax everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.390" offset="16569950">The attack here is just a converse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.322" offset="16577682">We're saying that you can't tax anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.612" offset="16586877">And in fact in Breedlove, the Court noted that the tax -- that in justifying the exemptions that often there would be people too poor to pay the tax and to enforce it equally would be harsh and unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.194" offset="16637137">In the cases after Breedlove, we feel either relied on Breedlove or involve points that are not at issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4332.632" offset="17434917">Giving out my final point and that is the First Amendment argument, the Court has on several occasions noted that other rights are protected through the First Amendment incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause but other than those rights specifically spelled out within the First Amendment, that is freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.719" offset="17535227">We think that the Court's holdings on this First Amendment area can generally be summarized by saying that any action which is a form of political expression has generally been protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.662" offset="17587054">Now, this has involved cases, we're petitioning through the Courts who have been involved, the use of litigation to obtain equality, and similar areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.689" offset="17627178">It's appellant's position that voting is the highest form of political expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.896" offset="17647971">That all other political activity is to no avail that it can influence people who have to cast a ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.902" offset="17675975">Further, in this area, appellant believes that this Court has stated on several occasions, notably in the American Press Company or Grosjean versus American Press Company that the power to tax and the power to destroy especially in the area of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.368" offset="17737832">And the po -- that principle is nowhere better illustrated than in this case where the dollar and fifty is legitimate than $50 is or a $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.043" offset="17772523">Furthermore, those people who are disenfranchised by the tax or just little people that cannot do anything about it, their method of redress to the Government is close to them because they cannot vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.684" offset="17819126">We feel that what this Court said in Wesberry versus Sanders and reiterated in Reynolds versus Sims adequately sums up the situations regarding our position on the poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.911" offset="17868027">One of the most precious rights in a free society is that of having a voice in the election of those officials who make the laws under which we as good citizens must live.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.894" offset="17907942">Other rights, even the most illusory are -- or rather, other rights even the most basic are illusory of the right to vote is undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.663" offset="17939080">And our Constitution has no room for classification of people in such a way as to unnecessarily abridge that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.624" offset="17966874">We think the Virginia poll tax laws are inconsistent with that declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.075" offset="17988712">If it please the Court, I would reserve the remaining time for rebuttal to be handled by co-counsel, Mr. J.A. Jordan.</text>

            <text syncTime="4484.714" offset="18043256">The cases that have been presented for appellants and of course -- it is a fortunate advocate who can speak with the favoring type of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.156" offset="18089023">We agreed that the enlargement of opportunity in the largest sense is one of the historical goals of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.973" offset="18128311">And Virginia has been known to make some contribution in that regard and we'll do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.332" offset="18157672">We appear here not in opposition to those aspirations would only to see that they'd be accomplished through lawful means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.442" offset="18198215">The Court no doubt is concerned in seeing that the Government -- business of government have conducted within constitutional limitations with the maxim that every man is created free and equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.662" offset="18247011">But individual freedom is not likely to survive unless the Court also respects the federalist principle which was the great means by which a union of many states was formed and has been maintained despite these trends and changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.900" offset="18336037">Yet that is the very principle that at bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.688" offset="18351188">The object of attack in these cases and what is -- I throw one of the few vested jury rights of the States and one of the most delicate and sensitive areas of local government, the rights to suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.940" offset="18412105">Those circumstances reinforced a judicial responsibility to where the particulars of the poll tax here in issue against the specific words and history of the constitutional provisions that are invoked against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.259" offset="18473441">The cases are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.507" offset="18478456">They are very well summarized and fairly stated by counsel for appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.605" offset="18498832">With regards to poll tax itself, I think only one additional comment may be made to being the law clearly before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.312" offset="18533627">And that is all that is necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of the poll tax if you pay $1.50 in each year by December 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.605" offset="18586812">There's no such a case for citizens to make astronomical predictions of future election dates and govern their conduct accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.504" offset="18622443">December 5 is the annual payment date and that's all it says in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.945" offset="18652223">The presentation or oral argument -- I mean, may I add to some statement of facts that Mr. Justice Black may have a comparative approaching with complete serenity the constitutional issues here involve because of the virtual absence of any evidence whatever in the record only a few statistics from census.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.114" offset="18732889">The oral arguments had had this advantage of simplifying the issues surprisingly in part for the Court to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.294" offset="18769565">At this phase, my learned Brother Brown admits that Breedlove against Suttles is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.935" offset="18796105">And that he cannot prevail unless it's overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.810" offset="18811674">The next phase by distinguished made by the Solicitor General virtually abandoned the argument he's emphasized so much in this, but this time on the added history, that voting rights derived from the First Amendment, alluding to any argument but without any consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.484" offset="18894326">And finally, my Brother Segar admits that the purpose from legislation the motive inspiring it 64 years ago is not determination, but rather the objective, factual operation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.177" offset="18961095">Actually, the case presented by appellants involves as my Brother Segar's argument so well emphasizes an importance, an emphasis on the importance of certain political rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.683" offset="19027132">For instance, Bridget is relied on as virtually dispositive where the Court gave such emphasis to the right of appeal in criminal prosecutions, the case obviously involving a deprivation or potential deprivation of liberty of a person contrary to the constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.782" offset="19111560">The Solicitor General has with the eloquent discussions by him emphasized the importance of the political rights of expression at the ballot box without bothering, however, to identify before the Court exactly the origin of the right he has emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.391" offset="19181986">So if the Court would permit, I would like to turn to those constitutional provisions that seems to us dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.188" offset="19221170">I find the declaration of independence or -- more realistically upon its vindication by virtually in combat.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.321" offset="19257637">The thirteenth colonies, and has became 13 sovereign states with the full panoply of rights associated with that status including most naturally and necessarily the right to determine the qualifications for suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.035" offset="19316569">That existed throughout the period of the confederation until the adoption of the Constitution in 1788.</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.865" offset="19355857">If anything can be accepted as a certainty, it's this, that in adopting the Constitution in 1788, no colonial state imagines for a moment, that it was thereby relinquishing its sovereign authority to establish the qualifications, the suffrage in his own local elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.794" offset="19439553">Quite to the contrary, they provided it even in the election of representatives of the larger house in Congress, House of Representatives, that the qualifications of elector should be those determined by the States before the members of the larger house of the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.541" offset="19510606">Clearly, it's left with each day its sovereign power to determine the qualifications in its own election and adapt to them as a matter of federal law for election of congressmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.219" offset="19565255">Indeed had any other provision that's been put in the proposed management perfectly obvious it was never have been accepted by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.353" offset="19609767">Now, exactly the same policy both in substance and in expression was reiterated in 1913 when the election of senators was transferred from the States to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.598" offset="19662744">And here again, the choice was not given to all the people nor where a specific qualifications the particular people enunciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.432" offset="19698166">On the contrary, the identical language of the original instrument wasn't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.568" offset="19718646">The electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for election to the members of the most -- innermost branch of the state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.278" offset="19761486">In conclusion, on that one point, the determination of voter qualifications is exclusively a matter of state concern and it's to be exercised by the State alone as they may wish unless their particular conduct in a particular situation infringes upon some other constitutional inhibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.508" offset="19850407">Now, passing over the guarantee of a republican form of government as intrinsically too vague and that even -- that's for implementation because of the infirmities, we must look to the amendments and by these points stressed so by my Brother Segar, I'm sure that his position is that the right of suffrage is not a First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.634" offset="19950926">We have told on brief that the first -- the freedom of speech is a meaningless set of word, a master keystone of the arch is supplied by the right to cast a ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.765" offset="20007455">And we're about to admire the novelty of that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.279" offset="20025532">We suggest that the Court should reject it for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.150" offset="20040997">And this says, if the First Amendment had been designed “a comprehensive charter or political freedom and the right to vote is the supreme expression of political freedom, it would have then mentioned, indeed mentioned first of all, when point in fact, it is not mentioned at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.928" offset="20132112">And then this is perfectly clearly understood concept, every constitution adopted in 1776 which were five specified freedom of speech as one of the retained rights of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.656" offset="20182998">They were Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.693" offset="20207135">And incidentally, it was demanded for the Federal Constitution in adopting that kind of resolutions on New York and Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5035.049" offset="20244543">But in other documents is there anyway or any hint that the right of suffrage was included within that basic freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.901" offset="20284040">The second phase, where the Court unimaginably to read the First Amendment as conferring the right of suffrage, this would contradict the position of Article 1, Section 2, leaving that choice as I said wholly to the States and Your Honors can have a little doubt that that announcement we have inevitably defeated the adoption of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.522" offset="20394486">And finally, number three, the First Amendment was of course adopted as a shield against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.527" offset="20434505">And it cannot now be resist to absorb against the States in that of the suffrage unless some curious contrary constructions were required which is not, as I shall show, whether that's in the history of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.441" offset="20498139">So in short, the First Amendment has no reference at all to suffrage and that is conferred, we suggest to the Court, by every subsequent amendment to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.358" offset="20541816">Why should there be the Fifteenth Amendment saying that the right to vote should not be denied or bridged on account of race or the Nineteenth referring to sex, or the Twenty-Fourth referring to the poll tax in federal elections, if universal suffrage had been unconditionally guaranteed by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.723" offset="20627289">It would be a bold argument to say that those repeated constitutional amendments were useless, needless, and heedless which is the essence of the argument that's upon you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.752" offset="20683400">A point of fact contrary to any conception of universal suffrage at the time of the adoption of the First Amendment, I say as has been indicated by statements or questions of the bench, poverty qualifications, work, customary, and prevalence throughout the states at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and a few years later of the adoption of the Tenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.348" offset="20789770">Passing then to the Fourteenth Amendment on which great stress is laid by all the appellants, we submit, that how vague this counsel may be in the face of Mr. Justice Holmes, one thing is undeniably clear and that is that it does not include the right of suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.815" offset="20883707">The tax itself as Your Honors will recall includes Section 2 saying that when the right to vote is denied or abridged that the representation of the State in Congress shall be proportionately reduced in (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.343" offset="20945774">And that means that the State may discriminate as much as it wishes but will pay the penalty in the prescribed manner for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.472" offset="20982241">That was not merely a matter of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.118" offset="20996869">Representative Bingham, Mr. Justice Black has characterized or aptly as Madison of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment and who has referred to himself conspicuously in the arguments last week in South Carolina closed the debate in (Inaudible), a very solemn and authoritative moment with this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.179" offset="21081088">The amendment does not give as the second section shows the power to Congress of regulating suffrage in several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.355" offset="21117868">That was the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.161" offset="21125078">I came to the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.692" offset="21131139">Senator Howard's speaking for the Chairman of Reconstruction Committee said the theory of this whole amendment is to leave the power of regulating suffrage with the people or legislature of the State and not to assume to regulate it by any clause of the Constitution of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.587" offset="21210760">Moreover, Your Honors, with your keen historical sense would remember that when that amendment was presented for ratification, ten of the 23 states that ratified it prior to 1870 had tax or property qualification requirements as conditions to the right of suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.318" offset="21305637">Massachusetts was one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.894" offset="21315981">New York, curiously enough, did not disqualify paupers in voting nor they required payment of taxes in all cases, certainly not in the case of white paupers, where it did provide that men of other races had to own a free home worth $250 and paying tax on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.431" offset="21398110">Six of the states required tax payment from all voters.</text>

            <text syncTime="5335.401" offset="21445966">In -- it -- in 1868, I believe it was, Your Honor, plus or minus two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.545" offset="21482538">My suggestion is that inconceivable that so many states would spontaneously undertake to reform themselves at the cost of invalidating their own suffrage requirements particularly when they have been assured, by the Congress of the United States, illustrated by Bingham and Howard that the amendment itself would have no effect upon such values.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.061" offset="21584624">They plainly acted on that premise and Congress itself acted on the same premise a year or two later in readmitting Georgia with the poll tax included in its new constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.495" offset="21638332">Now, with all those events, quite especially in Minor, this Court in 1875, rejected and attacked by a female citizen on Missouri on a local constitutional requirement limiting the suffrage to male citizens, their contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5400.216" offset="21705310">This is Minor against Happersett, 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.464" offset="21718267">Her contention was that local law has it all written by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.625" offset="21742926">But the Court said certainly is the Courts can consider any question sensibly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.775" offset="21759540">This is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.393" offset="21766019">For nearly 90 years, the people had acted on the idea that the Constitution when it conferred citizenship did not necessarily consider the right of suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.999" offset="21804366">The Constitution has not added the right of suffrage, the privileges and immunities of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.451" offset="21830175">Pertaining now, from the Fourteenth Amendment, my next suggestion to the Court is that that construction has been successively and uniformly corroborated by earlier amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.867" offset="21883883">Only some three years later, the Fifteenth Amendment was proposed and promptly ratified saying of course, the right to vote should not be denied on reason on account of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.825" offset="21939681">The meaning of that is that until the adoption of Fifteenth Amendment, a state was free to discriminate on grounds of race or color but not after the adoption of the Fifteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.515" offset="22002479">The same Congress, condemning the suggestion I just made, rejected numerous proposals to outlaw property and poll taxes either by an act of Congress or by congressional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.670" offset="22067054">So at the same time that it was rejected, those provisions, it limited itself to a guarantee of immunity from discrimination which is what the Fifteenth Amendment embodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.276" offset="22125464">And following exactly that same constitutional canon, in 1820, the Nineteenth Amendment used precisely the same words in giving immunity from discrimination on a count of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.782" offset="22179485">And that again means that until that time, the right to vote could be denied as it indeed it was on the grounds of sex but not thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.325" offset="22225669">It's more important because dealing precisely where poll tax questions, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment and Mr. Justice Black said that the Congress assumes certain responsibilities of its own provides that the right to vote should not be denied or abridged on -- in federal elections because of nonpayment of poll taxes or any other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.558" offset="22322636">So in all three instances, these parallel congressional -- excuse me, constitutional amendment dealing with the right to suffrage, the amendment means that the matter was previously untouched by the Fourteenth Amendment but thereafter would be governed by the new amendment to the extent expressed in the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.777" offset="22411452">I emphasized those last three words no further because this was the point of my concern in the last Congress with regard to a Voting -- Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.017" offset="22464428">The report of the House Committee on a judiciary recommending the Twenty-Fourth Amendment emphasized that the Twenty-Fourth Amendment would not prevent a state from imposing a poll tax in purely state or local elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.818" offset="22527645">And indeed, it was admitted that the amendment owed much of it support to the fact that it was precisely so limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.338" offset="22561708">That was announced in the concurrently accompanying Minority Report Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.081" offset="22588771">The same effect on the other side of the Senate, Senator Holland, where he was one of the permanent cosponsors of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment explained to the Committee on the Judiciary in Senate that the amendment does not prevent the imposition of a poll tax as a prerequisite for voting for state or local elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.006" offset="22672468">I emphasized this part as I have continued because many of us who are cosponsors strongly feels that the elections of state and local offices are more properly and effectively handed at the state and the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.671" offset="22731086">And we would strenuously oppose any effort to control such matters by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.057" offset="22756582">Now, I'm not asking Your Honors to consider subtleties or innuendos.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.799" offset="22775599">I merely presume to recite a simple narrative, successive constitutional amendments of uniform tenure that we submit established, general constitutional construction in accord with both the text and the history of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="5703.700" offset="22919168">But the very next year, this Court pointed out in the Reese case, 1876, that before the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, it was as much within the power of the State to exclude citizens of the United States from voting on account of race and so forth as it was on the account of age, property, or education.</text>
            <text syncTime="5726.182" offset="23009134">That's why they had the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.175" offset="23021046">But the Fourteenth Amendment did not prevent discrimination of any such kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5736.386" offset="23049989">Then again in Pope against Williams in 1904, a Maryland requirement was sustained requiring registration one year in that case, not six months, one year ahead or, prior to the election date saying the privilege to vote in any state is not given by the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.790" offset="23135566">No wonder my learned brother now has difficulty in identifying the provision on which they rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.687" offset="23147165">The Court continued with the question whether the conditions prescribed by the State might be regarded by others as reasonable or unreasonable is not a federal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5770.778" offset="23187498">Maybe because that's exactly the issue arrived by any whether Griffin, a means of the Griffin because of its intrinsic appeal is a ground of constitutionality or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="5795.657" offset="23286972">The importance of this principle in the federal scheme received the attention of this Court soon after in the Guinn case in 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.180" offset="23337127">There, the Court pointed out but the Fifteenth Amendment did not take away state authority over suffrage because it had belonged to the state governments from the beginning.</text>

            <text syncTime="5963.483" offset="23958319">The similarities are distant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5964.847" offset="23963752">I'm puzzled from the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.806" offset="23971589">I don't commit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.499" offset="23982352">We come then to Breedlove.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.365" offset="23989875">The Solicitor General alluded (Inaudible) I think rather faintly to the possibility that it dealt with sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.541" offset="24018610">I gathered that there may be some implication from its title to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5983.664" offset="24039090">But in point of fact, that was not the issue presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5988.496" offset="24058420">The official report makes it very clear, that the argument of those attacking the local statute in that case is precisely what the Court hears today from a visible with a characterized argument of the appellants in a single sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.565" offset="24122681">The argument there was the admission today that a state has the power to prevent its poor inhabitants from participating in the choice of federal officials would be totally contrary to the contemporary spirit of American institution so there couldn't be a squarer attack upon the power of the State to require payment of poll tax as a condition to suffrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.085" offset="24216722">But the Court had no trouble in disposing of that and it said to make the payment of poll tax prerequisite of voting is not to deny any privilege or immunity protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.504" offset="24266459">And that such a custom was read, familiar, and reasonable regulation long enforced in many states.</text>
            <text syncTime="6048.587" offset="24298747">Mr. Justice Clark asked earlier if they went to such a good decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.091" offset="24312748">There was, Butler against Thompson, a decision by a three-judge court in the District of Virginia affirmed here per curiam in 1951 where at a time finally goes decision in Virginia on the poll tax requirement precisely the same one here in issue was rejected by the court below and affirmed here despite invo -- the invocations of the Fourteenth and the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6078.781" offset="24419537">And some of the particulars of that argument felt more personally on the Fifteenth Amendment which I shall come in dealing with Evelyn Butts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.144" offset="24456944">So we submit to the Court that the court below in the instant case rightly concluded the decision had been squarely settled by this Court both in Breedlove and in Butler.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.510" offset="24514414">And beyond that, that this Court correctly so decided in view of the constitutional text and history.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.906" offset="24552030">And during the last two years, as Mr. Justice White have indicated, the Court is faced with a number of civil rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.821" offset="24583690">The most prominent ones of course are the reapportionment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.260" offset="24597483">I'm getting with Baker against Carr, going on to Gray and Sanders, Wesberry and Sanders, and most lately Reynolds against Sims.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.209" offset="24633219">But none of those raised the question of the qualification to vote which the only question presented to the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6143.519" offset="24678463">The Government here admits, page 23 of its brief, that each of the apportionment cases dealt only with the right of persons qualified under state law to vote and the holding of the Court was put fair weight must be accorded to a vote once cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6163.642" offset="24758920">It couldn't mean to allot or diluted by unfair apportionment territorial or several means of calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.538" offset="24802597">Another recent case was United States against Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.968" offset="24816285">That involved no new principle that was decided same day with Mr. Justice White's question, Carrington against Rash.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.964" offset="24848259">Indeed our principle as old as Yick Wo against Hopkins in 1886 namely that a lower house who have affair on its phase is indolent if it is systematically employed to discriminate against a chosen race or (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.415" offset="24918058">And before as referred to Carrington against Rash, may I mention two cases referred to our brief and I do so because this comment was not made in our answer brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.010" offset="24964451">Nixon against Herndon and Nixon's same intangible judgment against Herndon, 1927 and 1932 respectively challenging action of Texas or to be more exact, action in Texas, that denied him the right to participate in a primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6236.304" offset="25049610">Both of those decisions invalidated that action under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6242.863" offset="25075837">And the point of my present comment is that at that time, Classic had not been decided intervening the primary with the voting process that receives this constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6257.810" offset="25135606">At that time, the theory was that a primary was a private action of a private route and not state action to which the command of the amendment was addressed and for that reason not quite political question raising the issue of suffrage or qualification after therefore the Court's dispose of it under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6285.990" offset="25248350">But Classic has now reversed that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6290.289" offset="25265591">A primary is recognized as being an integral part of the election process such as of the general election itself and for that reason, both of those cases have now disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="6302.482" offset="25314283">We submit and just by being swallowed up in their overall decision in Smith against Allwright where the classic doctrine was applied to the Texas primary, so then Carrington against Rash deferred answer to Mr. Justice White's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.668" offset="25383037">There, an army sergeant, not born in Texas, had come to Texas in an on service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.033" offset="25416579">And by their actions, the detail of them not being of interest except to say they were overwhelming had satisfied all normal requirements for residents in Texas to such extent indeed that as the Court said, that Texas conceded his right to vote but for his uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.094" offset="25512814">But Texas law said that no serviceman may ever acquire a voting residence in the State so long as you remain in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6363.131" offset="25556908">And the Court held this contrary to the Equal Protection Clause as a permanent disfranchisement of all servicemen as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="6375.054" offset="25604660">Turning back two years Senator Sander said in the debate on the Fifteenth Amendment nothing can be a qualification for voting which is not in its nature attainable as residence, property, education, or character.</text>
            <text syncTime="6397.329" offset="25693686">Each of which is within the possible reach of well directed effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.824" offset="25711658">But residence having been admittedly attained in fact and recognized as Mr. Justice Stewart's opinion pointed out for other purposes like divorce, Texas was not at liberty, capriciously and in perpetuity to disfranchise a class because of the way they might vote any more than a vote could be diluted through malapportionment as in the apportionment cases of which I suggest.</text>

            <text syncTime="6779.101" offset="27220804">Well, I was going to say that they recognized that when Article 1 Section 2 conferred the right of federal suffrage upon citizens who had the qualifications for electors prescribed by the States, the fact made the right to vote in federal elections a federally granted right and thus within the protection of the statutes that were mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6805.183" offset="27325085">But in doing so, Article 1, Section 2 does not, in any sense, alter nor does it give the Congress the power to alter the requirements that the State may impose on elections for local offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="6822.995" offset="27396347">So in short, on Carrington, I would think it's fair to say that that was not actually a bona fide effort to establish qualifications to vote as in any commonly understood sense of that term.</text>

            <text syncTime="7042.737" offset="28275315">Moving on then to our next point, it is that the Virginia poll tax does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="7053.992" offset="28320350">Now, this is insubordination to our general position that the Fourteenth Amendment as such have in full application in any sense to suffrage qualifications but some particular comments on Virginia poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="7067.741" offset="28375312">First of all, when the amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, I'd -- if I mention that six states had tax requirements in effect as to payment of taxes, it's a condition to suffrage mostly in the form of poll tax requirements and that sooner after Georgia was reinvented with a similar poll tax provision in their Constitution, after screening by Congress to ascertain its compliance with the standing of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7097.963" offset="28496206">Because as Your Honor said in Breedlove, that was a familiar reasonable method of regulating suffrage long enforced in the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7106.556" offset="28530584">Again here, appellants reiterate the argument in Breedlove that the House whether general and prevalent property requirements may have been his qualifications for voting, that's the ownership property, as qualifications of voting and a poll tax requirements may have been his qualifications for voting and all that there is, they are no longer in keeping with modern conditions because they lost their relationship to current conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7136.848" offset="28651792">Well, if this Court is going to sit as a guarantee of modernity in all practices, your docket will certainly be accounted.</text>
            <text syncTime="7143.831" offset="28679690">Well actually, although that is the appearance with which appellants would seek to quote that appeal, what it really comes down to is a prayer that this Court should utilize the Equal Protection Clause to extinguish the historic functions of the states to regulate a matter that would always been recognized as their exclusive providence for the purpose of permitting diversities of view that you do in accommodating those diversities to disability of the general public as a federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="7174.762" offset="28803406">What?</text>
            <text syncTime="7175.841" offset="28807795">Even if the Court referred you to all of that and to say that wherever you think is reasonable is to prevail and whatever you don't think is reasonable had to be struck down, then even at that point we suggest that the Virginia poll tax as presently on the books and as presently administered is rational, serviceable, and nondiscriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="7197.760" offset="28895462">That being so closely related to the Fifteenth Amendment, we contend to that unfortunately as the major point.</text>
            <text syncTime="7205.474" offset="28926286">And the fifth element of it is no racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="7211.153" offset="28948961">When the Fifteenth Amendment going back now to the time of its proposal in Congress, was under discussion in Congress, amendments to prohibit property qualifications or educational qualifications and to prohibit the poll tax in terms where as I said repeatedly rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="7231.352" offset="29029836">And the meaning of this was emphasized by Senator (Inaudible) who said that the amendment, Fifteenth Amendment, does not take away from the State the right to regulate leave the states to declare that a man shall not vote and unless assessed to as freehold or has an education and can read the Constitution, whole question of suffrage subject to the restriction that there should be no discrimination on account of race is left as it now is.</text>
            <text syncTime="7258.088" offset="29136729">At that point, therefore, it was perfectly clear that the states were free to impose property, tax, or educational requirements without a prohibition by the Fifteenth Amendment and without regard to what the consequential effect upon particular groups or races might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="7276.110" offset="29208827">Now, whatever may be the practice in other states, it has been repeatedly found that in Virginia, the poll tax is in fact administered without any racial discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="7703.466" offset="30918280">The only other thing, were declarations by two senators in debate on the floor to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="7711.402" offset="30950045">Number one, the motives of Virginia convention of 1902 were bias and evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="7718.119" offset="30976899">And number two that the economic position of the Negro race in Virginia was nearer the poverty level or more within the poverty level than in the case of white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="7729.712" offset="31023292">That was all before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7732.681" offset="31035099">So I suggest to the Court that that could not rationally be viewed as a fin -- a basis for a finding in any tenable sense that Your Honors could sustain for instance on the appeal from an inferior tribunal certainly as applied to Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="7751.092" offset="31108765">I would regard it more therefore as a declaration but how are the few.</text>
            <text syncTime="7755.212" offset="31125274">And according with all respect that it's natural to accord the facts of the federal colony, surely, it is not conclusive and does not foreclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="7764.307" offset="31161637">It is a free examination of the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7768.289" offset="31177519">Indeed, I'm sure they remember the Court will recall they reiterated admission of the Attorney General in the South Carolina arguments last week that they had no evidence to present to Congress of discriminatory practices in Virginia said at least two or three times and answered the questions from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="7791.815" offset="31271664">Certainly, an idea and quite briefly with the question of original motive, I say quite briefly because essentially admitted these by one of appellants that that has little bearing upon present conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7804.053" offset="31320566">It is admittedly true that many of the most prominent and extreme cartographs I think was the one quoted Forssenius last year, members of the Constitution from 1902 said it was their purpose to discriminate against the Negro so far as the Federal Constitution might permit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7826.250" offset="31409382">But that was by no means the universal view of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="7830.862" offset="31427877">I think it would be difficult to show that it was the prevailing view of the conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7835.341" offset="31445744">Certainly, there were many other views expensed of which I quote too.</text>
            <text syncTime="7840.818" offset="31467687">One that by a proposed poll tax requirements, more white people then will be stricken from our registration rolls than Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7850.298" offset="31505617">But that was not the basic aim.</text>
            <text syncTime="7853.343" offset="31517738">Virginia had suffered throughout an agonizing period of reconstruction following her defeat in the civil war and her efforts to retrieve her statute of equality on the states of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="7865.388" offset="31565908">And basically what the convention wish to do was to eliminate the illiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7871.726" offset="31591299">And this was expressed on the floor of the convention that their purpose was to eliminate the illiterate “not only in the country but in the cities and towns, not only among the blacks but among whites in order to deliver the State from the burden of illiteracy and poverty, and crime which rests on it like a deadly poll”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7895.159" offset="31685026">And crucially, this was summed up by another delegate, Mr. Weiser, in his words speaking of the poll tax requirement we can -- in its specific nexus of the six months prepayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7908.997" offset="31740406">Then we have an educational requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="7913.116" offset="31756810">The voter has to pay a poll tax, prepare his own application, and cast his own ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="7920.891" offset="31787948">The plan virtually eliminates the incompetent from politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="7927.478" offset="31814280">So we think it's unsupported to say that the motives of the convention were predominantly evil but even if they have it, this Court has uniformly recognized that that is not the ground of invalidating legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7941.113" offset="31868824">Mr. Chief Justice Marshall pointed that out 150 years ago in Fletcher against Peck that if for them to say aptly one which the legislature might constitutionally pass, a court cannot entertain a student, founded on the allegation of the interior motives which influence their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="7959.646" offset="31943011">And more recently, the Court reiterated in 1951, Tenney against Brandhove, the holding in the Court in Fletcher against Peck, that it was not consonant with our scheme of government for the Court to inquire into the motives of legislators as remained unquestioned and specifically on this Virginia poll tax, the current issue, it was held in Butler that a law is fair on its face and it's also fairly administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="7987.276" offset="32053457">It is not rendered invalid by the equal motives of its chancellors.</text>
            <text syncTime="7995.454" offset="32086162">The question before -- the next question, I would like to take up is the relationship of the poll tax to the actual qualification of voters to cast the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="8008.876" offset="32139870">And that on the assumption, extreme assumption, I mentioned earlier that the Court will regard a test of reasonableness as controlling irrespective of constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="8021.620" offset="32190861">The point of emphasis here is the point I started out with, that no prediction of future election date is required in order to comply with the six months prepayment requirement because the uniform rotation of the sun brings December 5 back into view every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="8044.458" offset="32282185">And all that any voter has to do is to pay $1.50 on or before that date in every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="8052.386" offset="32313950">And he's in business so far as the right of suffrage is concerned.</text>
