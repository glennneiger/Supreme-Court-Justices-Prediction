            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Number 65, United States, Appellant, versus Herbert Guest et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.380" offset="167936">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="36.125" stopTime="536.791">
            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="36.125" offset="250901">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.070" offset="262708">As I mentioned to the Court in this case we are limited again to the allegation indictment and in this indictment it charges six individuals, which engaged in a criminal conspiracy in violation of 241.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.286" offset="339613">None of the defendants in this case were alleged to hold public office, nor any of them alleged to be acting under color of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.951" offset="386215">I think the indictment that very well could be read, because it's very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.281" offset="431564">After the beginning thought, the charge is the one that to deny the rights to the foreign equal enjoyment of good services, facilities, privileges, advantages and an accommodations of motion picture theaters, restaurants and other places of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.805" offset="513693">And two, the right to the equal utilization without discrimination upon the basis of race of public facilities in the vicinity of Athens, Georgia, owned, operated or managed by or on behalf of the State of Georgia or any subdivision thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.933" offset="586209">And three, the right to the full and equal use on the same terms as white citizens of the public streets and highways in the vicinity of Athens, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.463" offset="628318">Four, the right to travel freely to and from the State of Georgia and to use highway facilities and other instrumentalities of interstate commerce within the State of Georgia, and five, other rights exercised and enjoyed by white citizens in the vicinity of Athens, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.798" offset="709611">And I say at this point that the government agrees with everybody else that five adds nothing to the indictment, it could very well be left out.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.299" offset="751616">It was a part of a plan it 's alleged, it was a part of the plan and purpose of the conspiracy that its objects be achieved by various means including the following, shooting Negroes, beating Negroes, killing Negroes, by damaging and destroy property of Negroes, by pursuing Negroes in automobiles and threatening them with guns, by making telephone calls to Negroes to threaten their lives, property, and persons, and by making such threats in person, by going in disguise on the highway and on the premises of other persons, by causing the arrest of Negroes by means of false reports that such Negroes had committed criminal acts, and by burning crosses at night in public view all in violation of 241 and the District Court in a very extended opinion, sustained the motion to dismiss as to all the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.840" offset="997794">Now it's obvious that the indictment charge is single conspiracy, generally directed at preventing Negroes from exercise and/or enjoying their civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.356" offset="1043874">We take the position that the national government had the power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to authorize punishment of conspiracies having the specific purpose of preventing Negroes from enjoying the public facilities, opened up to them by a state pursuant to Section 1 of the same amendment and that's exactly what the Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.874" offset="1153902">Mr. Justice Holmes 50 years ago said, “The other sections have been repealed speaking of the Ku Klux Klan sections, but Section 19 it maybe said much mean what it meant in 1870 when the enforcement act was passed and what it did mean will be seen more clearly from the original words.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.984" offset="1242405">The source of this Section, the doings of the Ku Klux Klan and the like is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.369" offset="1263929">The acts of violence obviously were on the minds of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.260" offset="1279498">Naturally, the Congress put forth all its powers but this section dealt with federal rights and with all federal rights and protected them in the law,” “all of the federal rights and protected them in the law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="311.476" offset="1352328">In other words the Congress did the best it could by using the broad language.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.760" offset="1373435">Now, the rights here involved are spelled out in the indictment and they fall into three main categories, first, rights grounded in the Equal Protection Clause, specifically the right to the equal utilization without discrimination upon the basis of race of all public utilities owned, operated or managed by the state including the streets and highways et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.036" offset="1482627">Secondly, the right to travel freely to and from any state and the right to use its instrumentalities of interstate commerce, three, the right to equal advantages of restaurants, motion picture theaters and other privately owned places of public accommodation guaranteed by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.792" offset="1573637">The right to the nondiscriminatory use of public facilities owned or operated by the state itself is one grounded in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.268" offset="1631525">And again in the light of, I have here United States v. Williams but I should add, in the light of the opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas in United States versus Williams, the threshold question with respect to this branch of the case is whether Section 241 protects Fourteenth Amendment rights at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.000" offset="1714489">The District Judge said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.404" offset="1724103">For an affirmative answer on the issue we rely upon the brief in the case we've just argued, but in addition we say, “Following the legislative history, we show and operate that Section 241 was meant to reach private individuals acting in conspiracy and once you apply the strict requirements of the Screws case we urged that so construed the statute is not impermissibly vague.”</text>
            <text syncTime="436.826" offset="1853774">The heart of the case is easily laid bare.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.064" offset="1866731">Appellees are charged with the conspiracy to use force and violence for this specific purpose of preventing Negroes from daring to use the park, swimming pools, other facilities which the state of Georgia had a constitutional duty and was prepared to afford them equally with its white citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.271" offset="1967564">The identical situation might well arise with respect to schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.427" offset="1988148">If a state maintains a public school system it must open the door to Negroes within the area it serves as well as the white people.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.109" offset="2022839">For the school authorities, the bar [Inaudible] because the race is a plain violation of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.554" offset="2052618">The question here is simply whether the United States may also remove the obstruction interposed by Daniel Tucks who stand outside the door and because of race keep the Negro children from approaching it or who as in the present case roam the neighborhood, threatening with violence any Negro family with six fabulous children enjoy the unsegregated education which the state has a constitutional duty to provide and which it is providing.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.544" offset="2192635">And our answer is that this United States has this power and it has this power as an adjunct of its right and duty to enforce the state's obligation to provide equal educational facilities without segregation.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="536.791" offset="2253657">Would your argument encompass Mr. Stewart -- yeah, Mr. Justice Stewart's hypothetical in the last case?</text>
            <text syncTime="542.435" offset="2276227">Could the Congress make it a -- the murdering of a Negro a crime -- federal crime.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="549.389" offset="2304021">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.215" offset="2307260">I think the language in the Wardell case clears it up pretty well.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.981" offset="2334323">The United States versus Wardell, this Court said “The right here guaranteed is not the mere right of protection against personal violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="568.299" offset="2379672">This is the result of an ordinary quarrel or malice would be kind of blended laws of the state and by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.562" offset="2408720">We are not urging it at all and later on I'll give exactly what we say for example, if these same defendants in this case just went out and solely because they didn't like Negroes, they shot and murdered one, that wouldn't be under the statute, wouldn't be on ether one of course and I doubt that Congress would have that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.632" offset="2513000">I think that the -- we take no quarrel with the position, that the right to punish for murder is inherently the state's job to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.502" offset="2552498">We don't even go so far as to say the federal government can only move in if the state doesn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.804" offset="2577680">We say that these are two rights which we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.394" offset="2591995">One is the -- that once the state under the Fourteenth Amendment and pursuant to the requirement under the first section abolishes segregation and discrimination of all kinds then once they do that then the Congress under the fifth section had the right to make sure it worked.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.509" offset="2676527">Does the indictment allege as part that the purpose of this was to obstruct the state in fulfilling it's obligations under the Fourteenth Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="655.969" offset="2730339">Well, why do you say the State has strike first?</text>
            <text syncTime="659.881" offset="2746013">That is your -- what you say.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="661.482" offset="2752387">Well, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.594" offset="2756775">One, is it is true that in this particular area the State is acting to --</text>

            <text syncTime="668.225" offset="2779345">State may act but do you mean to say that the state has to act first before the federal power is going to come into play?</text>

          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="676.945" stopTime="717.400">
            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="676.945" offset="2814245">Well, I think it would be a problem there as to what was the purpose of the intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.056" offset="2854682">You see that the crime would never come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.244" offset="2863459">There's no need to intimidate somebody if the State is preventing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.884" offset="2890000">If the State Policeman says “You can't come down this street, there's no need for the private individual to tell you, you can't go.”</text>
            <text syncTime="706.546" offset="2932632">But when the state says you are welcome to come down the street and you're welcome to go in this building then the private individual sometimes lose it.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="717.400" offset="2975995">Yes, but if the State's policies and laws permit segregation or forbid Negroes to use these public facilities and if there is a private group -- a group of private persons who interfere with the Negroes' use those public facilities, would it be your position that the federal power does not reach those [Inaudible] in that private group?</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.541" offset="6812651">Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.998" offset="6826444">I would like to make it clear at this point that we would prefer that the Court consider all of the rights as we have set them out in the indictment because this is merely the indictment stage and when it gets back assuming that it goes back to the District Court, problems not only of proof but wait what goes to the jury and what doesn't go to the jury will of course be taken up by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.943" offset="6942218">At this stage we are at loss as to know just what evidence will come in or what the evidence will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.318" offset="6971685">But the indictment alleges a conspiracy forcibly to prevent Negroes because of their race from enjoying equally with their civil rights including among others the benefit of the public facilities, streets and highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.693" offset="7037200">And there is no question that the rights here are asserted are rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.632" offset="7064994">In the briefs we spell out all of the areas on page 11 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.366" offset="7087877">I mentioned before this right is grounded in the Equal Protection Clause but the District Court held that Section 241 did not encompass Fourteenth Amendment Rights at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.597" offset="7140854">So once again, we come back to Mr. Justice Douglas' opinion in the Williams Case which recognized the specific rights secured by the Fourteenth and mid -- Fifteenth Amendments as being rights within the scope for Section 241.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.990" offset="7210444">With that in mind, we have argued in the Price Case due process rights were also included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.708" offset="7233327">No one has suggested a satisfactory basis for excluding Equal Protection Rights while still keeping due process rights, either should be a right of privilege secured by the Constitution which is using the like of Section 241.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.115" offset="7302917">Section 241 when applied the voting cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.841" offset="7317859">There's no question that it was a clearly covered conspiracies by private individuals as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.890" offset="7341996">We convinced that the same applied to Fourteenth Amendment Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.438" offset="7360178">And getting back to Senator Pool, he pointed out that individuals may prevent the exercise of the Right of Suffrage, individuals may prevent the enjoyment of other rights which are conferred upon the citizen by the Fourteenth Amendment as well as trespass et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.428" offset="7436142">Our argument proceeds in three direct stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.864" offset="7453905">First, we take the position that federal powered plainly extends to dealing with those who intentionally obstruct Federal Officials in performing a duty which is imposed on them by law and I'm of course referring to the Logan Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.529" offset="7524540">There, the Court sustained the conviction under the predecessors of Section 241 of the leader the mob who attacked and killed the prisoner who of course was in the custody of the United States Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.315" offset="7571665">Grounds of the decision whether the United States and the Marshall had a duty under the Constitution and laws of the United States to protect the prisoners in their custody, and therefore, the Congress had the power to punish those private citizens who interfered with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.285" offset="7643554">Our second point is that the same rule applies to those who obstruct state officials and the government -- or in the performance of their duty which was also imposed by the government -- Constitution namely the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.784" offset="7705621">And the duty of the state to make the same public facilities open to all races without discrimination imposed by the Equal Protection Clause and it is a federal duty and the power to enforce that federal duty surely extends as in the Logan Case the sweeping away all obstructions to its performance intentionally raised by private persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.193" offset="7803214">The basic point is therefore rather simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.855" offset="7817843">Just as there is constitutional power to punish aggression against federal officers and of preventing their performance of their federal duties, so may the Congress punish private interference designed to impede or frustrate state officials in the performance of their federal duties which came about under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.486" offset="7920347">And thirdly, we urge that the United States has the same power to deal with private conspiracies intended to defeat enjoyment of the federal constitutional right as it has to reach conspiracies aimed at thwarting the State's performance of its federal constitutional duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.605" offset="7992863">One must be certain of course that the private conduct is specifically aimed at the employment of the federal right to Equal Protection at the hands of the state or to purpose its private racial discrimination, no federal right in duty in the absence of statute is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.463" offset="8076246">Here the heart of conspiracy is alleged to be barring Negroes from enjoying that equal access to public facilities which the Equal Protection Clause requires and the States was apparently ready to to afford, almost already affording.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.783" offset="8161614">Under these circumstances, there is no significant difference between frustrating the performance of their federal duty and barring enjoyment of the correlative federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.588" offset="8212814">United States against Wardell is squarely in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.076" offset="8226712">In that case, the man was trying to perfect his right on homestead land and he was interfered with by private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.051" offset="8262656">Now as I mentioned before the Logan Case is in the same category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.585" offset="8280733">Interference with the reciprocal relationship by coercion or provider would be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.614" offset="8308945">The argument runs but not interference by cohesion of the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.918" offset="8330156">The fallacy is that federal interest is in the provision and the enjoyment of the state facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.672" offset="8357115">That's the federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.949" offset="8366205">The practical objective of the constitutional guarantee is that Negroes shall receive the equal opportunity for the use of facilities that the state provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.837" offset="8409778">The reciprocal relation between a federal duty to furnish protection and a federal right to enjoy the protection owed was pointed out by this Court in the Logan Case where it was said “The existence of that duty on the part of the government necessarily implies a corresponding right on the part of the prisoner to be so protective.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.464" offset="8504341">And this right of the prisoner is a right secured to them by the constitutional laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.061" offset="8534643">So here, there is a federal right which defendants conspired to take away from Georgia Negroes, specifically the right to enjoy the public facilities furnished to them without discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.696" offset="8601203">We recognize of course that most of the cited cases involving third party interference was the relationship between the United States and the persons injured, such as the petition for interest of grievances, filling government contracts and mostly upon public lands whereas the present case superficially considered seems merely to involve third party interference with relationship between the persons injured in the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.295" offset="8719590">But in fact however, the relationship between the State and the Negroes which the defendants sought to intimidate, the relationship with the defendants intended to shatter is itself created by the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.903" offset="8786045">Thus, the interference with the victims' enjoyment of this right given to them by the federal government is interference with the relationship between the victims and the federal government as well as the relationship between the victims in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.304" offset="8847694">Since the Right to Equal Protection of the laws includes the right to have a state furnished equal access to public facilities that right too is a privilege in the immunity of citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.365" offset="8895864">Defendants are plainly charged with a conspiracy to interfere with the Negroes' exercise of these rights of equal access to public facilities and therefore, are charged with attempting to deprive them over their privilege of a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.653" offset="8961066">The power of the Congress to punish conspiracies to deprive one of their privilege or immunity of a citizen of the United States is beyond dispute and on that point even the Cruikshank case recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.730" offset="9017386">There is no inconsistency between our submission and the doctrine of the Fourteenth Amendment being concerned only with governmental action does not enlarge the right of private citizens among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.892" offset="9070049">Here, the indictment alleges explicitly and specifically that the object of the conspiracy was to prevent Negroes from enjoying the opportunity for the equal use of the property and the state had offered it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.611" offset="9132847">That specific intent is the critical element in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.051" offset="9150610">The word absent, the wrong might well be only an instance of private aggression beyond federal power, unless the state were shown to be withholding from the victims, the Equal Protection of the laws which is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.116" offset="9214872">The intent however, the defendants' acts are linked to the state's constitutional obligation and become interference with their relationship created and safeguarded by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.466" offset="9276312">That's not pure theory in simple practical terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.478" offset="9292403">The defendant's alleged aim was to bar desegregation of state facilities as required with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.650" offset="9329079">And particularly, we like to put aside because of the lack of a specific intent all instances of violence resulting from private cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.078" offset="9366800">If all that appeared was that A, B and C conspired to threaten and rob, or killed for personal gain or revenge, the state alone could have jurisdiction regardless of D's race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.246" offset="9419463">That D was a Negro incidentally lost the opportunity to use a state facility would be no more relative than the victim of another murder lost the opportunity to obtain a government contract of take a homestead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.467" offset="9480276">Nor would a general showing of racial antagonism sufficed if the state we're willing and able to extend to all races impartially the equal protection of its laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.047" offset="9522594">Here, the conspiracy is alleged to have been specifically aimed at barring the realization of the right to equal use of facilities offered by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.326" offset="9563763">It is that specific intent to bar their enjoyment of a constitutional right against a state upon which rests the federal power in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.993" offset="9610365">A different case will also be presented if the objective of the conspiracy would interfere with speech, association or assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.568" offset="9648713">Although, we may well wish to argue upon a later occasion that the federal government may protect men against private violence aimed at suppressing speech, association or political activity for present purposes, we may assume that even in such a case the federal government could not constitutionally interfere if the state were supplying equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.595" offset="9736798">In such case, there's no relationship between the state and the victims beyond the obligation to provide them with the same protection as other citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="3388.598" offset="13660808">In the Court below there was an indictment was brought against six defendants, all of whom are here as appellees, Guest and five others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.765" offset="13753490">Among the five was the defendant Lackey, I have the honor to be appointed by the Court to represent James Spergeon Lackey, one of the appellees and I appear here for him alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.228" offset="13839381">Although there is no conflict of interest as I see it the present stage of the case then raises between the other five who are represented by Mr. Hudson and Mr. Lackey whom I represent by appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.364" offset="13915867">In the jurisdictional statement which was filed in March 1965 by Solicitor General Cox, the first of the questions presented is thus stated whether Section 241 of the Criminal Code reaches unofficial conspiracies against the exercise of rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.090" offset="14038852">In the brief of the government filed by Solicitor General Marshall in September of 1965, the first of the questions presented is thus stated whether Section 241 of the Criminal Code reaches private conspiracies against the exercise of rights secured by an Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.781" offset="14153582">Now regardless of the slight change in the wording, the essence of the question under the first part is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.153" offset="14195064">Does Section 241 reach conspiracies against the exercise of rights secured by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and specifically, does it do it when no state action whatsoever is involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.109" offset="14282836">Now the other two questions, the jurisdictional statement filed by Solicitor General Cox, page 3 that which is now become question 3 in the brief before the Court is whether Section 241 reaches unofficial conspiracies against the exercise of rights secured by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relating to places of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.719" offset="14433301">The other question is stated to be whether Section 241 reaches unofficial conspiracies against the exercise of the right to freely enter and leave the state, and the right to freely use instrumentalities of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.054" offset="14530685">Under the plan of argument that Mr. Hudson and I had agreed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.842" offset="14561823">I was to argue the first question leaving the last two to him, but before commencing the argument of the first question, I have this suggestion to make which was I hope fully covered in the brief of which I submitted some weeks ago and which I have not heard answer either by a brief or by oral argument and that is the question of the vice of vagueness of which it occurs to me pervades this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.150" offset="14755025">We take the position that that vice of vagueness pervades Title XVIII, Section 241 even when standing alone because as it's been demonstrated by the numbers of cases which had been before this Court on the question and the number of cases which had been before the inferior federal courts, the question of what is a right secured by the laws of the United States or the Constitution of the United States is right wide open question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.911" offset="14954078">Now, that vice even as it pertains to the statute standing alone is intensified all of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.581" offset="15012801">When the government contends that as here as I understand it that Title XVII, Section 241, passed back in 1870 I believe, is now since 1964 supplemented by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.996" offset="15130457">So that I suggest to the Court that the -- that vice of vagueness has been nowhere better described than in the brief filed by the Solicitor General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.827" offset="15209765">In this Court the Solicitor General who immediately preceded the present Solicitor General in a comparatively recent case lead up to it by calling to the Court's attention to Lanzetta et al, versus State of New Jersey, 306 U. S., page 451.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.001" offset="15326480">It was there held if on it's face a challenged provision is repugnant to the Due Process Clause, specifications of details of the offense intended to be charged would not serve to have validated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.791" offset="15405578">Compare United States versus Reese, 94 U.S. 214, 221.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.839" offset="15429820">It is the statute not the accusation under it that prescribes a room to govern and warn against transgressions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.270" offset="15487498">Citing Stromberg versus California 283 U. S. and Lovell versus Griffin 303 U.

            <text syncTime="3872.517" offset="15596481">The applicable rules is stated in Connally versus General Construction Company, 269 U.

            <text syncTime="3950.034" offset="15906607">Recently, in 1964 this Court has decided the cases of Griffin, Barr, Bouie, Bell and Robinson, all in the 378 U. S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.463" offset="15964285">The United States as amicus curiae filed briefs entitled in all of these cases in September 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.310" offset="15999707">It was submitted by the Honorable Archibald Cox, Solicitor General, Greg Marshall, Assistant Attorney General, Ralph S. Spritzer, and Louis F. Clairborne, assistants to the Attorney General and Harold S. Greene and Howard A Glickston, attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.910" offset="16082045">At pages 26 and 27 of that briefs they wrote, the general rule is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.527" offset="16112556">Before a man can be punished, his case must be plainly within the state -- it would be in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.580" offset="16140769">The vague criminal statute violates the first essential of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.664" offset="16161144">It is like the ancient laws of Caligula, a prep for the innocent citing United States versus Cardiff 344 U. S. 174, 176 which I believe was written for the Court by Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.332" offset="16231779">The duty of warning before punishing applied equally to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.366" offset="16251946">The Fourteenth Amendment imposes upon a state an obligation to frame it's criminal statutes so that those to whom they are addressed may know what standard of conduct is intended to be required citing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.113" offset="16318924">Now the Cardiff cases uses this specific language the vice of vagueness in the criminal statute is the treachery they conceal either in determining what persons are included or what acts are prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.824" offset="16389768">Words which are vague and fluid compare the United States versus Colin Grocery Company, maybe as much of a crap to the innocent as the ancient laws of Caligula and there's a quotation in that brief, and I would take time to read all of it here, it appears at page 6 of the brief which I filed for Lackey back in September, at page 35 is a quotation from Professor Freud.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.492" offset="16508364">“The objection to vagueness is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.585" offset="16532814">Inadequate guidance to the individual who's conduct is regulated, an inadequate guidance to the triers of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.573" offset="16564788">The former objection could not be cured retrospectively by ruling either of the trial court or the appellate court although it might be cured in the future by authority's judicial clause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.849" offset="16633856">I leave that for application I hope by the Court, most particularly when you come to listen to the argument with respect to the second and third questions presented by the Solicitor General in his brief because as one of the justices in the question pointed out those questions are his inception or the conception of the drafts of the indictment of what the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prescribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.423" offset="16828103">As I read the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the prescriptions of it, the compulsions of it are quite different from what was stated in questions 2 and 3, but that simply illustrates the question of vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.066" offset="16922666">So that I'd come back to the question which was assigned to me and that is what is meant by the rights secured by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.546" offset="16996645">It appears to me that the answer can only be the right of any person within the jurisdiction of the state not to be deprived by that State to the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.314" offset="17063727">Now that's where the word private and the word unofficial in the statement of question is made by the Solicitor General, but becomes so important because as I understand the position of the government is this that just leaving out 2 and 3 for the moment that he takes the – takes the categorical position that in the case like this that the private persons -- private persons maybe the state in depriving another persons of the equal protection of the law and in the case that preceded this I had the opportunity to hear the argument in the case that preceded this and in this case too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.209" offset="17279289">He hinted that the language that these occur -- both on the language of Senator Pool of North Carolina, I believe he'd said it was, what Senator Pool of North Carolina back in 1860 -- 1869 intended the Equal Protection Clause to mean or thought it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.727" offset="17385347">And I submit to the Court that if this were the case of first impression, I don't know what importance the Court would attach to the remarks of Senator Pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.805" offset="17437696">Suffice it to say that whatever cozette they may have had, that cozettcy has been completely wiped out by repeated decisions of this Court beginning in 1875, seven years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.914" offset="17538111">Further that unbroken line of decisions commences with United States versus Cruikshank to which illusion was made before noon, 92 U. S. 542 written by Chief Justice Waite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.702" offset="17625255">He was a native of Ohio in 1875 and it continues down to the very latest decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.192" offset="17663185">Now in that opinion handed down just seven years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, Chief Justice Waite reigned a Court consisting of himself and I call attention to the residences of these -- of the justices who composed the Court at that time because that wasn't just a decade after the end of the war between states and they were men from states, not in the south, not in Mississippi or Georgia or Alabama and men who presumably knew what the Congress of the United Stated did in 1868 when it submitted the Fourteenth Amendment to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.909" offset="17862029">There were associate justices, Clifford of Maine, Hunt of of New York, Strong of Pennsylvania, Bradley of New Jersey, Swayne of Ohio, Davis of Illinois, Miller of Iowa, and Field of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.284" offset="17943531">The only one of the Justices who dissented was Justice Clifford and strange to say that Justice Clifford was the only one of the nine who had not been appointed by either President Grant or President Lincoln.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.943" offset="18002254">This is important I think I'm not just as gossip at all because it illustrates contemporaneous construction of an amendment proposed to the States by a defendant and the construction given by the men of judges, justices and the Chief Justice of various diversified locations and here's what they wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.909" offset="18106117">“The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from denying to any person within his jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws but this provision does not add anything to the rights which one citizen has under the constitution against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.993" offset="18186365">The equality of the rights of citizens is a principle of Republicanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.381" offset="18207995">Every Republican government is in duty bound to protect all its citizens in the enjoyment of this principle if within its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.070" offset="18246760">That duty was originally assumed by the States and it still remains there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.588" offset="18272778">The only obligation resting upon the United States is to see that the States do not deny that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.663" offset="18317082">This the Amendment guarantees but no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.952" offset="18334218">The power of the national government is limited through the enforcement of this guarantee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.419" offset="18368073">And yet it is suggested in the briefs and it is suggested in oral argument before the Court that the -- this Section of the amendment which provides for appropriate legislation may go beyond that vague sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.252" offset="18471414">It speaks of the first part of it being self executed but what it is, is what it is and it is a limitation on the power of Congress, under the -- without the Fourteenth Amendment of course no legislation of this sort could have been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.959" offset="18554274">The Fourteenth Amendment was adopted for the purpose of giving the federal government sacred powers, but that power of the national government is limited to enforcement of that guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.130" offset="18611012">What guarantee?</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.172" offset="18619162">The obligation resting upon the United States to see that the States do not deny equal protection of the laws to any person within its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.959" offset="18666287">Now, there was a birth of the doctrine of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.209" offset="18707247">Four years later it was reiterated in the Virginia versus Rives, 100 U. S. page 313.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.315" offset="18759701">I call your attention, if you please, to the language of the Court at page 318 of the Rives case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.454" offset="18792302">The provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution we have quoted all have reference to state action exclusively and not to any action of private individuals, any action of private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.510" offset="18868475">And in the Rives case decided practically, contemporaneously with the Cruikshank case 92 U. S. at page 214 in 1875, the third and fourth Sections of the Act of May 31, 1870 which I think of the -- is the source of law, this section here, it was the sixth section I believe, not being confined in their operation to unlawful discrimination on the count of race, color or previous condition of servitude, are beyond the limits of the Fifteenth Amendment and unauthorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.125" offset="19042973">Now, that is important although it deals with the Fifteenth Amendment, because the Fifteenth Amendment contains the very same appropriate legislation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.178" offset="19083201">Of course, I recall as I'm sure Your Honors do that United States versus Rives was applied by Judge Hoyt Davis in the Rives Case in the middle district of Georgia some years ago and this Court reversed the Rives case which I believe appears in 362 U. S., but distinguished the Rives case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.580" offset="19212769">It didn't add pieces at all, it's still the law of the land, that down through the four score and ten years which haven't left since 1875, there have been many Congresses, many Justices of this Court to come and go, many attorneys general, many solicitors general, many constitutional amendments, but the principle remains primarily embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.202" offset="19391237">That amendment erects no shield against merely a private conduct however discriminatory or wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.712" offset="19425301">So wrote Chief Justice Vincent in 1948 in Shelley versus Kraemer and two of the Justices who joined in that decision are watching the list, still members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.722" offset="19489353">Ten years later, ten years after Shelley versus Kraemer, on September 29, 1958 in the Middle Rock crisis at the August 1958 special term of this Court in Cooper versus Aaron, 358 U. S. page 1, the Court said, “The controlling legal principles are plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.747" offset="19597396">The command of the Fourteenth Amendment is that no state shall deny to any person within his jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.124" offset="19638983">The State acts by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities, it can act in no other way,” that pages 16 and 17, Cooper versus Aaron, quoting from ex parte Virginia decided in 1879, 100 U. S. at page 347.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.401" offset="19748070">I recognize of course that the concept of what is or is not state action may have varied since 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.429" offset="19796135">Take for example Lombard versus Louisiana or Peterson versus Greenville, 373 U. S. 244, but the fundamental principle remains firmly embedded and as late as 1963 was succinctly stated in Peterson versus Greenville.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.434" offset="19904178">In deciding these cases, the Court does not question the long established rule that the Fourteenth Amendment reaches only state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.194" offset="19975231">Antecedent to that the government says in its brief, page 23, the text of the Equal Protection Clause read in conjunction with the fifth section of the Fourteenth Amendment authorizes legislation reaching private conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.887" offset="20066032">Now that Section is this, quoted exactly, “the Congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.432" offset="20108142">Now in this lengthy discussion of that thesis the government at page 29 of its brief says, 'In short, the Equal Protection Clause states the nature of the right guaranteed protected equality and defines the area of constitutional concern state activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.060" offset="20206676">The rest it would seem is left to Congress empowered by Section 5 of the Amendment to enforce the guarantee by appropriate legislation, the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.961" offset="20270310">Now, I ask what risk?</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.512" offset="20284520">There isn't anything left invisible because the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.798" offset="20333631">Further the government says at pages 50 and 51 after alluding to the old Harris case, I have refereed to the old Harris case in 106 U. S. that's contrasted with a more recent one of the same name to which illusion is made in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.416" offset="20408132">But in the old Harris case written by Justice Woods is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.346" offset="20439792">“So far as we are aware there are no more recent cases in this Court that bound the question,” this is a government copy, “To be sure it has been reiterated that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States,” compare Shelly versus Kraemer, “But such statements may fairly be read as defining only the self executing force of the Amendment only did by implementing legislation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.549" offset="20580645">Now that last sentence is directly conferred to the express holding in the Harris case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.136" offset="20610947">There in 1882 in holding Section 5519 of the Ohio statute unconstitutional, the Court has to say it in Cruikshank, and in Virginia versus Rives said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.124" offset="20682940">“This authority show conclusively that the legislation under consideration finds no warrant for it's enactment in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.841" offset="20721810">The language of the Amendment does not leave this subject in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.873" offset="20737902">When the State has been guilty of no violation to this provision, when it has not made or enforced any law abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, when no one of it's departments has deprived any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, or denied to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.337" offset="20839779">When on the contrary the laws of the State as enacted by the legislative and construed by its judicial and administered by its executive departments recognized and protected the rights of all persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.501" offset="20888472">The amendment imposes no duty and confers no power upon Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.139" offset="20922953">Now that case is cited by his Honor, Mr. Justice Black in his dissent in Bell versus Maryland recently wherein the dissent said and there was nothing in the main opinion that contradicts the argument, that's opposed to the argument that I make here with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.718" offset="21017307">But it so succinctly stated, “no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.766" offset="21073523">This section of the Amendment unlike other sections is a prohibition against certain conduct only when done by a state, state action as it is come to be known and erects no shield against merely private conduct however discriminatory or wrongful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.421" offset="21144158">This well established interpretation of Section 1 of the amendment which all the parties here including the petitioners under Solicitor General accept means that this section of the amendment does not in itself standing alone in the absence of some cooperating state action or compulsion forbid property holders including restaurant owners to ban people from entering or remaining upon their premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.060" offset="21254708">Even if the owners act out of racial prejudice, but the prohibitions to the amendment extend to all actions of the state denying equal protection of the laws whether by its legislative, executive or judicial authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.320" offset="21315730">The amendment thus forbids all kinds of state action, by all state agents and officers that discriminate against presence on the account of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.444" offset="21352197">It was this kind of state action that was held invalid in the City of Greenland, in Lombard, in Griffin versus School Board, and in Robinson versus Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="6017.130" offset="24174989">And that is borne out very, very clearly by statement by Senator Humphrey, and of course now the Vice President in which he states that Section 207 (b) of the Civil Rights Act which provides that the remedies provided by this Act shall be the exclusive means of enforcing the Act is necessary otherwise, the persons would contend that a violation of this Act could result in prosecution on the 18.241 and 242, he used the exact statement.</text>
