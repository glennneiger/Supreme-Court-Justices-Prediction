            <text syncTime="382.782" offset="1634513">The hearing examiner decided it on that case, on that theory, but then when he undertook to determine the substantiality of the effect, he said, “If you measure this against the national market it won't be substantial.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.989" offset="1871287">At conclusion of the hearings which lasted a year -- a year and a half, the trial examiner, the hearing examiner considered it was a Section 3 case and so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.250" offset="1912351">He decided as I say on the theory that he had defined substantial effects upon competition as you do under Section 3, but the Commission struck out those findings because the retail limits were not the correct limits of the relevant market and said, “We find that to violate Section 5, it's akin to a tie-in arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.051" offset="2019558">Then having found that akin to a tie-in arrangement, the Commission considered our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.797" offset="2046516">No you have to measure it against the effect upon the competition and said that that's immaterial and reiterated again.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.987" offset="2083297">We find it violates Section 4 but added in any event in fact and I'm not quoting the exact words that in any effect we find that the competitor's standards had been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.421" offset="2133034">Now before the Court of Appeals, the argument of the Commission was this is akin to a tie-in arrangement and they cited Northern Pacific and half a dozen other cases and the Court of Appeals analyzed those cases distinguished them and said, “No, it's not akin to tie-in arrangement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="526.207" offset="2208162">Now in the brief filed here, the word tie-in only appears twice and as I understand that the Commission has abandoned the tie-in theory and as I understood the counsel to say their position is that the standards of Section 3 is met namely the substantial effect upon competition and we do rely upon tamper, tamper was a 20-year prohibition, 20-year exclusive dealing or requirements contract affecting a little less than 1% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.441" offset="2349119">Here is an agreement that's terminable at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.952" offset="2363225">The market is not foreclosed to these other dealers and they actually are selling in this market.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.638" offset="2425919">The foreclosure here is only temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.824" offset="2438666">When anyone buys, if I would buy a pair of shoes not much of the market is foreclosed and preempted until they wear out and need another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.642" offset="2469909">Whenever a dealer buys his fall stock or his winter stock or his spring stock that market is preempted agreement or no preempted and when he comes to replace that he can buy those shoes from anyone he sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.785" offset="2538559">If he persists in buying a conflicting line and dividing his forces so that he cannot operate an efficient and prosperous store, we do terminating rarely but occasionally we do more often than we would like to and these services which we give the dealers are beneficial.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.170" offset="2628002">The record shows that these dealers hated by our advice of our servicemen, of our field men, their rate of return is 16% on their investment on the average compared to an industry rate of return 11.5%, 35% more.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.875" offset="2702921">And if any true words were spoken in this case whereby one of these manufacturer witnesses that the Commission put on in this agreement when he said dealers need these services.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.396" offset="2756942">Now, we can't in the first place afford to give services unless there's a comparable volume to sustain this expense nor can we give services that are worth having to tell a dealer how to merchandize another line of shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.880" offset="2830921">For us, to try to tell the dealer how to merchandize an international shoe brand of shoe or some other brand shoe, we don't know their patterns.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.932" offset="2887137">The only way we can tell what they are is to go look in the box and see what the shoe is like.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.339" offset="2912737">Our servicemen or field men are familiar with our patterns.</text>
