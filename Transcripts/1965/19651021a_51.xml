            <text syncTime="110.480" offset="545311">The three-judge division of that court appointed to sit on the petition, denied the petition by a vote of two-to-one.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.685" offset="830151">On this petition for certiorari, three questions have been raised which go the jurisdiction of the Court or the discretion of the Court to hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.174" offset="876022">The first one involves the timeliness of the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.576" offset="893680">The District of Columbia has attempted to show that since the petition was not filed within the 30 days called for by Rule 22, paragraph 2 of the Rule of this Court, this Court does not possess the power to hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.603" offset="957733">This is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.267" offset="964420">Haplin versus the United States cited in our reply brief quite clearly demonstrates that the rules of this Court can be waived by the Court in an appropriate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.076" offset="1011649">There is no jurisdictional statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.306" offset="1024606">No Acts of Congress provides the time within which a criminal case from the United States Court of Appeals is to be brought to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.204" offset="1064208">Rule 22, paragraph 2 is the only provision setting out the time limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.342" offset="1088763">I took, by the grant of certiorari, that this question had been considered by the Court and that the Court have decided in its discretion to waive the requirements of Rule 22 because of the unusual circumstances presented in the petition and in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.661" offset="1442043">I would have thought so myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.993" offset="1447372">However, in 1927, this Court in the memorandum decision in Ferguson versus the District of Columbia decided that the words in the Court of Appeals means that the court below have accepted the appeal where it is presented to it in a discretionary nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.888" offset="1522918">In Ferguson, which was much like this case, the petitioner reply to the United States would be equivalent then of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was denied discretionary review.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.785" offset="1582477">The petition for writ of certiorari was founded under the predecessor section, the Section 1254 and the Court, although not presented with any opposition by the District of Columbia and although the point wasn't argued in the petition for certiorari, decided that Section 1254 (1) did not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.187" offset="1668159">A subsequent case House v. Mayo has explained that the Court in Ferguson was of the belief that the words in the Court of Appeals mean that that court have considered the case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.013" offset="1715388">I think the case is wrong, but I don't' think it need be overruled for the purposes of this case in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.287" offset="1740570">Sections 1651 (a), the all writ section, as the Court well-knows gives this Court the power to issue all writs necessary in aid of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.626" offset="1785919">If the Court of Appeals had properly granted the petition for allowance of appeal when it had the opportunity, then Section 1254 would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.854" offset="1830745">It did not grant the petition for allowance from the appeal, that refusal to grant the petition was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.219" offset="1864286">The question is, whether that erroneous denial of the petition for allowance of appeal effectively precludes this Court from hearing the case on the merits, clearly not.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.058" offset="2459564">Now Ferguson can be right and this Court would have jurisdiction under Section 1254 (1) if the Court of Appeals have done what it should have done, issued the petition for allowance from an appeal, but for the erroneous refusal of the Court of Appeals to hear the case, the Court could properly hear it under 1254.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.135" offset="2571891">It's our position that the erroneous refusal of the Court of Appeals to hear the case shouldn't preclude this Court from exercising jurisdiction which should otherwise would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.578" offset="2613687">Again, such a case was House v. Mayo where the petitioner had in the district court applied for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.285" offset="2648482">The writ was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.923" offset="2655065">He applied for a certificate of probable cause under 2253 of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.510" offset="2673455">This was denied in both the district court and the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.359" offset="2688815">Since the case was never in the Court of Appeals as the Court in House v. Mayo stated Section 1254 did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.198" offset="2724133">However, they did bring the case here under a common law writ of certiorari under 1651 (a) noting specifically that the purpose of 1651 (a) was to protect the jurisdiction of the Court in just such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.819" offset="2778676">I think House v. Mayo is indistinguishable and principle on these facts from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.352" offset="2796753">I think it sets out a clear foundation for the exercise of this Court's discretionary power under 1651 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="682.968" offset="2835205">The third point raised by respondent in order to preclude this Court in considering the case on the merits involves the obvious fact that there are no evidentiary facts of the record -- in the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.004" offset="2899362">Respondent then in his brief cites cases which quite properly hold that the absence of facts from a record will in many circumstances cause the Court to refuse to consider a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.175" offset="2956100">We recognize this point of law is quite proper in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.068" offset="2975640">However, those cases are not like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.121" offset="2987865">This case involves an attack upon a statute on its face not as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.356" offset="3020779">An attack on its face is almost necessarily required where the argument is, that the statute is void for vagueness because the very force of the argument is that no one can know whether or not the statute applies to him and if this violates due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.381" offset="3088906">Now, the facts of the record -- of record are obviously irrelevant to an argument of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.382" offset="3108864">It doesn't matter what the evidence showed below, the argument is that the statute didn't give the man the information he needed beforehand to determine whether or not a crime was about to be committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.529" offset="3165497">This distinctness is quite clearly recognized in the case of -- the cases I've cited, United States versus Petrillo and quoted from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.003" offset="3199352">I think the quotation from the Court -- from that opinion in our reply brief to show the Court quite clearly why the absence of facts from the record is no impediment at all to its consideration of the case on the merit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.177" offset="5084035">I take no discomfort from the fact that there are states with other -- with statues much like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.622" offset="5105873">They've never been attacked on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.181" offset="5124054">They've never been determined -- their constitutionality has ever been determined by this Court or by any other court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.920" offset="5175045">The doctrine that we are invoking to show the unconstitutionality of Subsection 3 is one very familiar to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.746" offset="5206392">The doctrine of void for vagueness which has been so well explained by a professor in Amsterdam in his article in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.782" offset="5246516">The foundation of the doctrine is the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.315" offset="5268668">Due process as this Court sees it requires that citizens, the police and the courts be given sufficient guidance by penal statutes so that conduct which is prohibited and conduct which is permitted is with some degree of precision separated and distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.323" offset="5368665">This is obviously a task of weighing the merits of individual language in each individual case and for that reason, cases involving other attacks on other statutory language are not directly applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.137" offset="5439927">One of the considerations in determining whether a statute is void for vagueness is whether it has a long history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.543" offset="5473573">A history in which might lend it precision which isn't apparent in the face of the statute as it usually a determination made an economic criminality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.378" offset="5512861">But assuming it can be made in personal criminality, I think that the history of vagrancy statues generally and the specific history of the District of Columbia vagrancy statute demonstrate only one thing that vagrancy statues are purposely drawn as broadly as possible so that the police can sweep within the net of the vagrancy statute all those who are vaguely undesirable and who the police wish to place under detention or who wish they -- whom they wish to punish for some reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.167" offset="5664057">They find their origins, vagrancy statues find their origins in the fore laws of medieval England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.503" offset="5689344">Those were economic regulations and that suppressing the poor, keeping them within the enclosed to states, preventing them from moving abut England to seek higher wages and better employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.026" offset="5743470">They found their way into this country as part of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.030" offset="5759457">In the District of Columbia, the earlier statutes specifically applicable to the district as a whole that we've been able to find was the Act of 1892.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.760" offset="5794461">That Act did not in so many words mention leading an immoral or profligate life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.042" offset="5823509">It did mention in its reenactment in 1898, a category of a person as described as all suspicious persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.073" offset="5859662">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1900 in the case of Stoutenburg v. Frasier, struck down this part of the statute as unconstitutional on the grounds among others that it was unconstitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.777" offset="5918490">However, the statute remained on the books as reenacted in 1909 until the modifications of the vagrancy statutes in 1941.</text>

            <text syncTime="1490.845" offset="6066761">All five cases resulted in reversals, only the Stoutenburg case it is true went off unconstitutional grounds, the other four went off on the grounds of the facts shown the record do not demonstrate to the crime of vagrancy had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.351" offset="6124753">The courts of the District of Columbia, the appellate courts were quite zealous in making sure that such a broad statute wasn't used to impinge upon the rights of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.546" offset="6169579">The statute mainly went unused until 1941, when Congress disturbed by the growing number of what they considered undesirable people in the District of Columbia sought to have the statute recodified and cast a new language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.172" offset="6240110">Unfortunately, in Subsection 3, they preserved the language which has been introduced in 1909 of defining a vagrant is a person leading an immoral or profligate life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.394" offset="6280965">Other subsections defined other types of vagrancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.580" offset="6297684">One of these types was also carried over from the language of the 1909 and earlier Acts and described the vagrant as an idle person, just as an idle person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.404" offset="6348988">On the bill after passage by those Houses, went to the White House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.150" offset="6363930">President Roosevelt vetoed the Vagrancy Bill on the grounds that the words “all idle persons” were not within what he considered to be permissible limitations of statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.273" offset="6424430">He did not address himself to Subsection 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.587" offset="6437700">After veto, the bill went back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.575" offset="6445641">It was modified because the lead references to all idle persons, unfortunately not to persons leading an immoral or profligate lives and in that posture it was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.052" offset="6495587">Significantly, the last section of the bill as finally enacted is found today in Section 22-3306 and it provides that nothing in the vagrancy statutes shall be taken to make criminal, picketing or other labor organization activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.768" offset="6574477">I think the inclusion of this exclusion is highly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.136" offset="6599868">The memories of a highly vocal lobby in Congress obviously saw that language as loose as persons leading an immoral or profligate life might very well be used by unsympathetic prosecutors and judges to disrupt the labor movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.132" offset="6667891">They were tenet to this and had to put into the statute a specific disclaimer of coverage over labor activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.693" offset="6698193">Unfortunately, the poor without lobby went there and have their exclusions put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.959" offset="6723166">And Mr. Hicks and others like him have been convicted since 1941 on numerous cases of leading immoral or profligate lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.533" offset="6769455">Under the void for vagueness doctrine, another important consideration is whether the courts of a jurisdiction responsible for the statute have in their appellant process to find it with any greater precision in the language of the statute itself possesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.087" offset="6843747">In the District of Columbia, there have been a number of appellate decisions on the wording “leading an immoral or profligate life.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.918" offset="6875094">The most important of these is Davenport versus the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.472" offset="6897246">In that case, the Court of Appeals -- the local Court of Appeals, held that leading an immoral or profligate life was to be defined by reference to Webster's Second International Dictionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.741" offset="6954297">Not surprisingly, the definitions of moral and profligate, as viewed in Webster's Second International Dictionary and another dictionaries, the citations to which and the quotations from which appear in appendix to our brief, are just about as broad and amorphous as you might wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.274" offset="7044472">To get the full force of exactly how amorphous, I would like to read briefly from the definition given by the Court in Davenport versus the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.138" offset="7095881">The Court said, “Webster's Dictionary defines profligate as completely given up to dissipation and licensciousness, broken down in morals and decency.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.932" offset="7151052">The Court says, “It has been said that immorality is not necessarily confined to matters sexual in their nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.837" offset="7182712">It may be that which is contra bonos mores or not moral, inconsistent with rectitude, purity, or good morals contrary to conscience or moral law, wicked, vicious, licenseless as an immoral man [Inaudible].”</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.870" offset="7278843">Its synonyms are corrupt, indecent, depraved, dissolute and its antonyms are decent, upright, good and right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.516" offset="7349478">It's submitted that any penal offense defined in terms of be good and be right is no penal statute at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.900" offset="7394931">I don't think anyone at all can be expected to know what a man has to do, what he can't do in order to make sure that he doesn't come within this sweep of such a penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.964" offset="7471208">Davenport stands alone I think, in all the cases decided under the -- decided in an attempt to give more precision to statutes, penal statutes, which have gone so far to broaden language, which is already impossibly broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.594" offset="7557726">I think the problem is especially acute because convictions are not taking place in courts of record, in courts where the defendants ordinarily have counsel of their own or appointed counsel that are taking place in police courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.913" offset="7630973">These are courts where defendants are brought in groups, where testimony is by one policeman where the judge is highly unsympathetic to the views and arguments of defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.022" offset="7691473">To let a policeman loose on the streets with the word “good” as his law and all that he need shown in order to justify an arrest and attention of a citizen, I think is patently unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.675" offset="7770049">I think it violates every tenant of Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.834" offset="7790738">To let a judge sit in judgment upon penal offenders with his only standard that of right or wrong, is under any definition a void for vagueness, a void statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.171" offset="7888018">Several questions are presented by the Davenport definition of “leading an immoral or profligate life.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.497" offset="7933367">For example, what specific evil or what group of evils that Congress wished to circumscribe within the words “leading an immoral or profligate life”?</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.644" offset="7977984">Are they petty acts alone?</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.018" offset="8355401">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.445" offset="8355297">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.775" offset="8355192">I think that major acts would also be not good and not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.937" offset="8355088">There's' nothing in the statute to distinguish between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.291" offset="8354983">Perhaps, one might have thought immoral or profligate life refers to sexual aberrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.136" offset="8354879">However, Davenport tells us that matters immoral are not confined to matters sexual in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.835" offset="8354774">They concern a lot of other things including things that aren't right and aren't good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.190" offset="8354670">So, in other words, there's no limitation in the framework of sexuality and extends to other acts as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.878" offset="8354565">It was a statute attempted -- was the attempt of a statute to expands acts or other recognized categories of crimes?</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.949" offset="8354461">I think not because if this was the purpose of the statute, it would be a mere redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.366" offset="8354356">They are already on the books of the District of Columbia, ample provisions dealing with theft, with murder, with rape, with petty larceny, with things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.819" offset="8354252">I think it would be unreasonable to suspect that Subsection 3 was meant to cover only those acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2117.417" offset="8573053">This Court, in areas of free speech and free press, the freedoms of expression has been very zealous to strike down statutes, which possibly might be used to impinge upon the freedoms of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.296" offset="8656541">I think if ever there was a statute which might be used to impinge upon the freedoms of expression, it's Subsection 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.804" offset="8694575">Leading an immoral or propagate life is giving a speech under a license from the Department of Interior on Fergus Square about the tenants of Nazism leading an immoral or profligate life.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.416" offset="8821008">One can think of other numerous examples of possible abuses of the freedoms of expression by virtue of Subsection 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.483" offset="8857266">It is true that in this case, it has not been shown because of the absence of a trial record whether in fact, Mr. Hicks was engaging in constitutionally protective activity at the time of his arrest, but this isn't the important thing where the constitutional rights of freedom of expression are concerned, this Court will allow a person to invoke the constitutional rights in effect of a third party so long as the statute under which he is convicted, can under its construction by the courts of that jurisdiction the use to impinge upon freedoms of expressions and such a case was NAACPB v. Button.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.545" offset="9045556">There was no showing that to register as required by the Virginia Act in the Button case, would impinge upon any constitutional right of the NAACP or its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.989" offset="9099368">The Court however, struck down that particular part of the statute that's unconstitutional because it could very well have been used to impinge upon the constitutional rights of the members of the NAACP.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.085" offset="9155688">Subsection 3, I suggest again, fits the category very well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2275.102" offset="9203754">Our personal confidence in the ability of the judges of the District of Columbia, Court of General Sessions to zealously uphold their oath of office and protect the constitutional rights of defendants as much I subjectively believe in it, cannot be a reason for allowing Subsection 3 to continue in existence as a valid statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.058" offset="9307617">The very purpose of the First Amendment freedom is to take out of the hands, the subjective hands of judges and policemen, the permission to exercise those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.964" offset="9375222">It may will be that never a Subsection 3 had been used to violate anyone's constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2939.508" offset="11861452">The section reads, “In criminal cases in the District of Colombia Court of General Sessions, the court may upon convictions suspend the imposition of sentence or impose sentence and suspend the execution thereof, for such time and upon such terms as it deems best if it appears to the satisfaction of the Court that the ends of justice and the best interest of the public and of the defendant would be served thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.458" offset="12001155">In each case of the imposition of sentence and the suspension of execution thereof, the court may place the defendant on probation and under the control and supervision of a probation officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.639" offset="12289964">We represent to the Court that in no instance have we've been able to find that following the suspension of the imposition of sentence, absent conditions imposed and the violation of those conditions, in no instance have we've been able to find a case in which a man has been brought back into the Court following the suspension of imposition of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.150" offset="12399992">In fact the practice is to in effect, tap the man on the risk and tell him to go away and behave himself and that is borne out by the record which indicates only the notation imposition of sentence suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.518" offset="12485465">Now, assuming before the argument that they are remand in the district court, that we assume that only for the argument, some latent power to bring this man back into court in connection with his judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.006" offset="12555368">Certainly, upon the expiration of the maximum period, about which he could under any circumstance be confined that there remains nothing upon which this judgment could operate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5021.155" offset="20188035">And the reference then would be to the criminal file.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.663" offset="20206007">Now if the Court had taken this personal bond, that would appear upon the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.135" offset="20259924">If there are no further questions on the mootness matter, if I may proceed to the -- great may years ago, this Court in the case of Forsyth versus Hammond, a case in which a writ of certiorari had been issued, the Court was requested to reexamine the question as a threshold matter and this Court said what has influenced us in our preparation, the Court said there are really two questions are involved; one of propriety and one of power, that with respect to the question of propriety the Court said that that should be considered as foreclosed because the Court has granted the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.611" offset="20473814">But that with respect to the question of power, that question is always open and when raised there must be considered and disposed off by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.073" offset="20523656">So using that case as a guideline and other cases to it, we have suggested to the Court of that under no theory is that jurisdiction to review on certiorari this particular case for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.031" offset="20623548">One, as has been mentioned by the petitioner and that is, if this case was not a case in the Court of Appeals for purposes of review on writ of certiorari and authority to that of course is the Ferguson case and two, we rely upon the House versus Mayo, but not for the reasons suggested by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.939" offset="20751130">In the Ferguson case of course in which it was sought to get into the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court by writ of error, the Court said that the case was not in the Court of Appeals and therefore cannot be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.864" offset="20806823">There does not seem to be any serious question in the minds of petitioner that he is not properly in the Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 12541.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.176" offset="20856038">But we go a step farther and say that there is no right to review because a petition was not filed within the time prescribed by the Court's rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.526" offset="20897520">Now petitioner first said that if -- that his petition was timely because it was filed within 30 days after the Court of Appeals entered order vacating and reentering the order denying a petition for rehearing in banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.500" offset="20973380">Petitioner has apparently abandoned that point now because he has said nothing further about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.134" offset="20995950">But insists that he is -- here, because he is invoked the jurisdiction of the Court under the 28th U.S.C. 1651, which confers upon the Court's authority to issue all writs in aid of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.178" offset="21072123">We submit that here being -- was no jurisdiction to be aided, and that even if the petitioner it had preceded in the manner, proceeded in the manner prescribed by the rules of the Court that he would not be entitled to review under the extraordinary writ section.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.606" offset="21161775">And what the --</text>

            <text syncTime="5274.875" offset="21202840">I think he is retreated to that point, that was I understand them, but I will address myself to both upon he's not properly here on the ended theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.305" offset="21244635">Not here on the 12 -- under 28 U.S.C. 125401 because his petition -- I mean because he is not a case in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.746" offset="21286327">He's not here under the 28 U.S.C. 1651, because that writ may not be used as a substitute for established appeal procedures and that in any event, the petition is not filed within the time prescribed by this rule, by the rules of this Court, the rules being a mandatory and jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5321.295" offset="21388518">Now You Honors, we'll recall that petitioner first went to the U.S. Court of Appeals saying in effect that I have not filed a petition within the time you required by the rules of the Supreme Court and ask the Court of Appeals if it would be good enough to vacate and reenter its order, so that the procedural defects could be cured and so that he could come up to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.094" offset="21527698">Now the rules of the Supreme Court require and the language so clear is to not require a construction of that the petition must be filed within 30 days and the rules authorize a justice of the court to extend the period to an additional 30-day period, but then only if the application for an extension is made before the expiration of the 30-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.629" offset="21637935">It was more than 75 days after the Court of Appeals denied rehiring in banc, before he went back before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.321" offset="21676701">Alright, so in that court to do indirectly what it had no authority to do directly, saying in effect and that is to enlarge the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.734" offset="21754337">We submit that that could not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.385" offset="21764890">That this Court even if it wanted to confer or to relinquish its jurisdiction, insofar I mean to -- yes, to relinquish its jurisdiction or surrender its jurisdiction so that the rules of the Court of Appeals would control that it could not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.938" offset="21851094">The rules of the Supreme Court as we understand it have the force and effect to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.594" offset="21877739">They were made pursuant to the rules of criminal procedure which in turn have the force in effect of law, and those rules of criminal procedures specifically provide that the time within which a petition -- a writ of certiorari in a criminal case maybe filed in the Supreme Court shall be within such time as prescribed by the rules of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.016" offset="21987453">Now unquestionably the Court has authority to amend its rules, but it has not done so and in the comparatively recent case of Robinson -- United States versus Robinson, the Court said that however desirable great of flexibility, however desirably would be to have great of flexibility in this matter of appeals that -- that's for the rule making process and not the judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.429" offset="22125066">So we say to the Court that -- laid down this -- under 1251 -- 28, 1651, is that jurisdiction to review this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.418" offset="22185044">Now petitioner says one other thing with respect to 28, 1651, and he relies very strongly upon the case of House versus Mayo and I like to say just the word about that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.847" offset="22238751">In that case, a motion was made to the Court pursuant to its rules for leave to file a petition of common law writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.081" offset="22283682">There the petitioner found himself in this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.367" offset="22300818">The case originated in the state court and it came to the District Court on the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="5556.578" offset="22329657">The District Court denied the petition and then dismissed -- refused the issue of the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.956" offset="22371244">As provided by law, the petitioner then sought from the District Court a certificate of probable cause, so that he could appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.723" offset="22426311">The District Court refused to issue the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5584.266" offset="22440417">The statute provides also that the Court of Appeals or a justice thereof, may issue the certificate and permit the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.827" offset="22478660">And so, the petition that came to the Circuit Court of Appeals saying in effect, “I tried to get a certificate of probable cause in the District Court, they wouldn't give it to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.030" offset="22515440">I have a meritorious case, please allow me to appeal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.152" offset="22531950">The Circuit Court would not even consider the application for a certificate, saying to the petitioner that, “You have no right here, unless you are possessed of a certificate of probable cause issued by the District Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.776" offset="22602480">Now obviously in that type of situation, the Circuit Court of Appeals refused to exercise jurisdiction which the law had conferred upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.718" offset="22646262">And traditionally, the writ of cer -- the traditionally a writ of -- the common law writ of certiorari is issued to compel a court, to exercise its jurisdictions, just as it has issued to restrain a court from exceeding its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.151" offset="22727973">So House versus Mayo is clearly distinguishable from this situation but it's distinguishable for another reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.012" offset="22763395">The case came into the Supreme Court in House versus Mayo through courts of the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.805" offset="22806549">Certainly, a case originated in the District Court and I say originating there, although the petitioner must first filed in the state court, but for the purpose of being -- of a procedure and the purpose of a case in a Supreme Court, it came by stages from the District Court to the Circuit Court of Appeals and then to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.060" offset="22891604">This case was never in the Court of Appeals and was now in a district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.037" offset="22911561">The case was in the District of Colombia Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.127" offset="22927862">Now it may well be that in time Congress may see fit to give the District of Columbia Court of Appeals a status of the highest court of state, but it has not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.327" offset="22984704">So the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, although occupying a position comparable to the -- to that of the highest court of the state, is not the highest court of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5732.432" offset="23033083">It is not in a court in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.588" offset="23045726">It is a court in the municipal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.152" offset="23064012">But that is not to say that the Congress has not provided for a review of its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.214" offset="23088253">It is only to say that the Congress had not seem fit to provide for appeals of right from decisions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5756.830" offset="23130676">It is provided for discretionary review and that is what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.231" offset="23156276">And it is very, very interesting and this is what happened in this vagrancy case, which has been transported to this Court in a very defective vehicle because certainly this case is not the proper vehicle to bring a constitutional question to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.337" offset="23236733">The case as been all originated in the Court and the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.509" offset="23261393">There was an appeal of right to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals which affirmed and it affirmed the decision on the authority of prior decisions of that court, which had construed the very section of the Vagrancy Act which is here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.427" offset="23329102">Mainly, this case as I mention on the brief Rogers case and the Davenport case and both cases of the Act withstood assaults against it on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.659" offset="23393991">So in this case, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals on the authority of prior decisions affirmed the judgment of conviction and this is most interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5834.469" offset="23441220">The Court of Appeals, Circuit Court of Appeals the highest court in this jurisdiction, the court which this Court looks to, have found decisions on questions of local law review of the record, such record as the petition sought it to bring that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5852.599" offset="23513736">And first stated, the issue of that court and then the entire court after the most careful and deliberate consideration, did not find sufficient merit on the constitutional claims to warrant it and allowing an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5870.646" offset="23585938">So what do we have standing?</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.619" offset="23593880">We have standing a judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals which remains undisturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.693" offset="23622196">It is suggested by petitioner here that this Court might bypass the Circuit Court of Appeals and notwithstanding the statutory scheme reach down and bring up to it, the record in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.113" offset="23687816">But petitioner did not even ask to their writ even assuming and we don't think the writ would issue to that court, but there has been no effort to have the reach -- writ extend to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.648" offset="23745912">So we say that if there is anything to be reviewed by this Court, it is the order of the Court of Appeals denying discretionary review.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.809" offset="23790634">The point has not been briefed, all that has been said or said, is that the Court abused its discretion because it did not allow an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5934.802" offset="23842565">But petitioner overlooks that fact, that in denying an appeal the Court of Appeals exercised the very jurisdiction that Congress had imposed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.785" offset="23894497">It did the very thing that Congress authorized it to do, because Congress said that in addition to other jurisdiction which this Court has, it shall have jurisdiction to review cases, judgments of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and then the Congress says, provided machine report by a petition for allowance of an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.929" offset="23999091">And if the petition is granted Congress said, “Then the Court shall review the record and shall affirm, reverse or make whatever disposition which is just and proper.”</text>
