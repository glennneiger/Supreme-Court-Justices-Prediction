            <text syncTime="11.452" offset="149191">Very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.086" offset="151698">Mr. Sparks, you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_robert_sparks" startTime="18.246" stopTime="398.682">
            <label>Mr. J. Robert Sparks</label>
            <text syncTime="18.246" offset="176358">Mr. Chief Justice and Honorable Associate Justices, I am going to make my argument on the merits of the case, if this Court reaches the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.076" offset="219721">Georgia insists as Mr. McPherson ably argued yesterday that this case should not even be here in the first place because a notice of appeal was filed 16 days after the District Court's order of remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.299" offset="280534">However, in the event the Court disagrees with our position, I am going to try to briefly state that the position of the State of Georgia in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.182" offset="328077">As the Court is undoubtedly aware, this is a -- an extremely complex problem of construction of the removal statute, the so-called civil rights removal statute which is at 28 U.S.C. 1443.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.752" offset="394428">It dates back to the Reconstruction Congress in 1866, the first Civil Rights Act enacted right after the conclusion of the war between the states granting a right of removal to any person who is unable to enforce or has denied his rights in the -- in a state court under any right of any law providing for equal civil rights of all citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.296" offset="532564">Now in 1880, we have the first definitive construction of that statute in two cases by this Honorable Court, Strauder versus West Virginia in 100 U.S. 303 and Virginia versus Rives in 100 U.S. 313 both decided the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.632" offset="625873">There was one essential difference between the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.053" offset="635591">Both cases involved and alleged deprivation by Negro defendants charged with capital offenses in West Virginia and in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.907" offset="683029">Their complaint -- the reason by which they claim the right to remove the cases from state court to the Federal Circuit Court at that time was a deprivation or a systematic exclusion of Negroes from the traverse jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.308" offset="768606">Now in the Strauder case, West Virginia at that time had a provision in their constitution which limited electors to White persons with certain other qualifications and then they had a statute which in time said that only electors could serve as grand jurors and traverse jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.897" offset="850944">On the other hand, Virginia had no such statute or a provision in their Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.589" offset="881768">The allegation in the Virginia case was that jury commissioners, judges, and state officials were systematically excluding Negroes from traverse and grand jurors although not required to do so by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.718" offset="954284">At that time, this Honorable Court held in the Strauder case that removal was a problem and should've been granted to reverse to conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.901" offset="994931">The Strauder case reached this Honorable Court through the usual procedure of appeal to the state courts and certiorari to the Highest Court of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.691" offset="1034115">Now, Virginia filed a writ of a petition in this Honorable Court for a writ of mandamus against Circuit Judge Rives, who had accepted a petition for removal and it writ -- and it issued a writ of habeas corpus and had denied a -- excuse me, I don't think Virginia even filed a motion, a petition to remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.001" offset="1123349">They just went -- came straight to this Court for an order of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.982" offset="1147277">And this Honorable Court in the unanimous decision held in Virginia versus Rives that in order for a defendant to remove his case under the Civil Rights statute that there must be a discrimination set out by the state statute or a state ordinance that any alleged discrimination or denial of equal rights by any person else other than by state statute was not removable and that the proper remedy for such defendants was to defend themselves through the state courts or preserve their right -- their federal right and then apply to this Honorable Court for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.325" offset="1328671">And Your Honor -- and Your Honors, Georgia stands today on the Virginia versus Rives case and seven other cases decided by this Honorable Court beginning in 1880 and going through 1906, Kentucky versus Powers being the last expression on this subject in 201 U.S. at page 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.212" offset="1424175">Eight consecutive case rulings of this Court has held the same thing that is that there must be a state's statute which prevents the exercise of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.181" offset="1476106">A state statute which is either unconstitutional or which denies a defendant in the state court an equal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.752" offset="1514350">This is the first time that this issue has reached this Honorable Court since 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.556" offset="1533576">As I said, Georgia stands on those eight decisions of this Honorable Court plus four Courts of Appeal which have held the same -- to the same effect three of them within the last two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.159" offset="1595956">The three that I refer to in the last two years of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York versus Galamison and incidentally, this Honorable Court denied certiorari in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.549" offset="1645589">City of Chester, South Carolina versus Anderson, that's in the -- that's by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in a recent decision by a court of -- by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.405" offset="1712985">That wasn't South Carolina, that was Chester, Pennsylvania, wasn't it, in the Third Circuit?</text>

            <text syncTime="411.318" offset="1748616">It's Chester, Pennsylvania, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.925" offset="1759065">And the Fourth Circuit case is Baines versus the City of Danville, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.406" offset="1784978">That case is only recently been decided by a majority of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.924" offset="1815071">I believe in February, it hasn't come out in the advance sheets yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.241" offset="1832312">And the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in some slightly older cases, Hull versus Jackson County Circuit Court and Snypp versus Ohio, the first of those cases in 138 F.2d. at 820 and the second in 70 F.2d at 535.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.272" offset="1904410">Those four Circuits have all followed the Rives-Powers line of cases and from henceforth in this argument, I will refer to the previous decisions as Rives-Powers which includes Neal against Delaware, Gibson against Mississippi, Murray versus Louisiana, Bush versus Kentucky, Williams versus Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.285" offset="2000541">In addition Your Honors, ever since the Kentucky versus Powers case, District Courts in 12 states have universally and without exception followed the Powers ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.006" offset="2059368">Virtually all of this -- the states of the south including New York, Michigan, these are outside of the south I should say, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey have universally refused to entertain removal petitions or have properly remanded them on a petition for remand was filed by a discriminatory state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.028" offset="2159470">It was not alleged in the petition for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.999" offset="2175352">Now, this is the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.942" offset="2183189">This is the first case which departs from this long line of federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.079" offset="2203669">The Fifth Circuit in the Rachel case by three panel court which was split three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.088" offset="2239718">There were three opinions written, one opinion for the Court written by Chief Judge Tuttle, one opinion for -- by District Judge White, who is to -- was sitting by designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.777" offset="2286529">District Judge White first agreed with Mr. McPherson's argument that the cases were not -- the appeals were not timely filed and said that Rule 37 (a) (2) does apply in the case you should have been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.981" offset="2335326">The appeal should have been dismissed and he adhered to that on rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.809" offset="2354657">A District Judge or Circuit Court Judge Griffin Bell agreed with the majority of the Court as the appeal was timely filed and that the case should be remanded to the --</text>

            <text syncTime="582.226" offset="2432293">-- to the District Court for a hearing but he differed sharply with what should be done at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.460" offset="2457161">The Fifth Circuit majority opinion directed the District Court to have a hearing and to dismiss the prosecutions if one single criteria were found and that is that the respondents were removed from the places of public accommodation for racial reasons alone basing it of course on this Court's holding in Hamm versus the City of Rock Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.438" offset="2565099">A District -- Circuit Court Judge Bell sharply disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.767" offset="2586415">He said that this constituted in his opinion, a breach of the principles of federalism as he knew it that such casual treatment of the Georgia courts posed -- presented a problem of jeopardy of the relationships between state and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.336" offset="2672724">Judge Bell said that, if the cases were remanded to the District Court that the respondents should be required to prove that they cannot receive a fair trial in the courts of the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.211" offset="2720266">Now, the opinion of the Fifth Circuit did not say a word about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.271" offset="2732492">They just said, "Take the case back and if you find that race was involved in the removal, dismiss the prosecution."</text>
            <text syncTime="665.874" offset="2766869">That gives the Court no chance -- the District Court no chance to determine whether or not the facts of each particular case and there 103 cases pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia alone, involving some 20 demonstrations in places all over Atlanta City in demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.829" offset="2862686">This Court in Hamm versus Rock Hill, of course, held that a person cannot be punished or prosecuted for peaceable, non-forcible exercise of the rights granted them by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with respect to public accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.462" offset="2933217">But that does not include all conduct which might take place in those places.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.638" offset="2957876">Another thing which we -- I particularly want to call to this Court's attention is the fact that the Supreme Court of Georgia has followed the Hamm versus Rock Hill decision of this Honorable Court in a unanimous decision by the Georgia Supreme Court in Bolton versus the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.171" offset="3040005">The Georgia Supreme Court discussed the decision of this Court in Hamm versus Rock Hill and abated a series of trespass convictions which arose from a sit-in or a demonstration in an Athens Georgia Restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.936" offset="3115133">Judge Bell said, the dissenting judge of the Fifth Circuit panel, "That the Georgia Court should have a chance to pass upon these cases in light of the fact of the decision in the Bolton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.901" offset="3170931">The fact that they held -- recognized in authoring the decisions of this Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="773.729" offset="3198307">I might add parenthetically Your Honors that up until three years ago, I was an assistant United States Attorney in the Northern District of Georgia, back, I was the first assistant for several years and I've been on both sides of this removal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.716" offset="3258284">I've on occasion had to remove cases from state to federal court under Section 1442 where federal officers were charged for offenses committed in the performance or in the color of their office.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.555" offset="3317635">And it seems to me that the decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that is a radical departure from all of the decisions of this Honorable Court on the question of removal and I'm talking about removal and not for the defendant's or the respondents would be convicted if they were tried in the state court but simply on the basic question of whether or not a person can allege that in a pure conclusion as they did in the Rachel petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.650" offset="3457964">If the Court -- I'm certain the Court will read the Rachel petition, you will see that it is nothing but conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.455" offset="3485236">They alleged only the facts that 20 people were arrested in this place, this place, and this place and so they were arrested while attempting to exercise their right to seek food, comfort, and the entertainment at these public restaurants.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.530" offset="3565484">Now at the time this petition was filed, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had not been enacted in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.761" offset="3598399">Then they -- well, then they alleged in one sentence that the State of Georgia by statute custom, usage and practice, supports and maintains a policy of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.725" offset="3662242">Then they alleged that they cannot enforce that they are denied their rights and cannot enforce their rights in the courts of the State of Georgia before any action is taken against any of these persons before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.871" offset="3726817">They do not allege a single discriminatory act by a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.263" offset="3740400">They do not dis -- allege any oppressive act by any prosecuting attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.086" offset="3767672">They simply said, "Because we were arrested, we conclude that Georgia practices such a policy of racial discrimination."</text>
            <text syncTime="927.685" offset="3814066">They do not even allege that the statute, the trespass statute under which they're being prosecuted as either unconstitutional or being unconstitutionally applied as to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.868" offset="3866833">District Judge Boyd Sloan who has recently retired from the bench but who has been both the state and federal court judge for about 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.101" offset="3907793">He promptly remanded the next day after it was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.940" offset="3923153">He remanded all the cases stating and relying upon all of these prior decisions of the appellate courts and of this Honorable Court, the Rives-Powers line of cases that it did not set out grounds for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.668" offset="3982085">Now the respondents in this case, I believe Mr. Amsterdam wrote the brief, I'm so informed and incidentally it was a very excellent brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.669" offset="4018030">It -- he's obviously spent years studying this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.192" offset="4040182">It goes back into history, congressional history and so forth, but Mr. Amsterdam, if he wrote the brief and I understand that he did, he claims that this Court can uphold the Fifth Circuit ruling in the Rachel case without disturbing the Rives-Powers line of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.181" offset="4120116">And he says, that is so for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.813" offset="4142582">He says that the Rives-Powers line of cases are a procedural matter that they protect a right under the Fourteenth Amendment against a procedural matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.871" offset="4202872">That is the right to have members of your own race empanel on the traverse jury which is to try you, and that this case is in the Rachel case, the right that the petitioners are seeking or the respondents are seeking to preserve by removing the federal court is a right against prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.468" offset="4297226">And he says that that is a substantive right whereas the Rives-Powers' line of cases are a procedural right only and therefore, there's a distinction that this Court can distinguish Rives-Power line of authority from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.994" offset="4367339">But I wish to call the Court's attention that that isn't what the Court said -- what this Honorable Court said in 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.562" offset="4397641">In Strauder versus West Virginia, the first of the cases that three -- at page 309, the Court asked this rhetorical question and this was a unanimous decision of this Court is not protection against a race or a color prejudice in empanelling a jury a right, a legal right under the constitutional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.232" offset="4492309">And then they answered it -- that was the Fourteenth Amendment of course and they answered it by saying, "If the statutes of West Virginia discriminating as they do in the selection of jurors amounts to a denial of the equal protection of the law to a colored man when he is put on trial on alleged defense against a state."</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.218" offset="4584260">And I submit that that is a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.332" offset="4604740">I submit that respondents has pleading when they say the difference between removing a case to the federal court because you can't have a person of your own color on the jury which tries you in removing a case because you cannot be prosecuted if you're within the holding of Hamm versus Rock Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.686" offset="4710066">They are both substantive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.379" offset="4720933">Either one is procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.854" offset="4726784">One is procedural in effect it -- prosecution is going forward in the Rachel case, prosecution was going forward and it was a question of state procedure there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.386" offset="4768893">Again, Mr. Amsterdam or the respondents say on page 95 of their brief and this is the essence of the case as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.744" offset="4818317">They said that defendants prosecuted for the exercise of the right, the equal public accommodations granted by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 may remove the prosecutions to a Federal District Court whether the statute under which they are charged violates those rights on its face or as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.544" offset="4901595">In other words, the respondents are saying if they have an absolute right to remove the case regardless of whether the statute is being constitutionally applied or is constitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.358" offset="4948825">In fact, in the brief, the respondents, they argue that persons prosecuted in the exercise of the rights granted under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are insulated from the prosecuted process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.052" offset="5015594">And I don't believe that Mr. Amsterdam will quarrel with those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.984" offset="5031267">He uses the term insulation several times that they simply cannot be prosecuted and I res -- most respectfully submit to the Court that if the Court should abduct the respondent's theory in this respect, it would create a virtual no man's land in law enforcement in cases arising or possibly arising in the future out of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.664" offset="5145997">Mr. Amsterdam apparently contends for the respondents that if a person is arrested in a place of public accommodation that before he gets to the jailhouse he can -- his lawyers can file a removal petition and he will be brought into federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.625" offset="5325824">If I might pose a hypothetical question, hypothetical situation, suppose that a number of demonstrators seeking to exercise their right to eat in a restaurant or formally integrated restaurant and incidentally, there are very few of those in the south anymore, Atlanta, Georgia is completely integrated, as integrated as Washington D.C.</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.678" offset="5534072">Certainly, the federal could not move in because federal law enforcement officers cannot move in unless they authorize by specific statute to -- and given criminal jurisdictions as the FBI and the Internal Revenue or the state official certainly would be ought to move in because they would have the idea that if they are making a case to be carried to the federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2449.198" offset="9900178">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.973" offset="9919300">Of the several grounds which Georgia urges for reversal here, one, the construction of a civil rights removal statute is of overwhelming importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.771" offset="9974471">Mr. Sparks has just said eloquently I think that state prosecutors in the Federal District Courts need guidance in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.818" offset="10014595">And the question is involved not only in this case and in the Peacock case which follows but in others pending here and many pending in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.081" offset="10047718">I perhaps should say in answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's question to Mr. McPherson yesterday that the issues in this case, Rachel, are not exactly the same as those in Peacock and that it might well be that Peacock might be decided in favor of a remanded state court, although, jurisdiction in the Rachel case would be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.437" offset="10129115">I think it would be very difficult to decide the cases the other way around but the issues are not exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.590" offset="10157746">Because of the importance of the issues, because Congress and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 deemed their resolution by this Court essential to the effective protection of federal civil rights by the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.726" offset="10226291">I would like to argue that question, the question of construction of Section 1443 of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.289" offset="10256488">First, notwithstanding the slight branch in strict logic that's involved in putting off until later the question raised by Mr. McPherson as to whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear the substantive contention on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.848" offset="10334751">Now on the issue of statutory construction, the text which we must construe is set out at pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.213" offset="10388250">And I mean to refer to it at this time not to argue the case under the language of the statute but merely to outline and I thought that it might be helpful to the Court, the various possible constructions of the statute and the contentions made not only by the parties here but also by various lower courts that have passed on the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.058" offset="10471633">I do this because as I shall say in a minute, I don't think that the question in this case is one that can be decided as a matter of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.966" offset="10503189">I do not think that syllogistic work with words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.495" offset="10521370">I do not think that punctuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.183" offset="10528057">I do not think that grammar is the answer to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.294" offset="10548537">I think its answer is in history and I think its answer is in the practical functioning of the civil rights jurisdiction in this country today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.692" offset="10570167">Questions I shall come to very shortly in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.225" offset="10588244">Now, looking at the language of the statute for the moment just for the purpose of outlining the possible constructions of it, I turn first to Section 1443 (2) because, although, the Fifth Circuit below decided this case on Section 1443 (1) as I shall make clear I hope a little later in the argument, I myself would prefer to see the Court rest affirmance of the decision below which you can do on Section 1443 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.349" offset="10720737">And also because Mr. Sparks has argued implications for this case from the Rives-Powers line of decisions and those decisions or constructions only of Section 1443 (1) leaving the Court entirely free I believe to construe for the first time in this case and the Peacock case following Section 1443 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.214" offset="10808195">Now, 1443 (2) allows removal where a prosecution is for any act under color of authority derived from any law providing for equal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.323" offset="10856678">There is also a refusing clause in Section 1443 (2) which we do not rely on in this Court which I believe the petitioners in Peacock removed -- petitioners in Peacock do rely on, we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.550" offset="10921566">We construe the phrase, “any act under color of authority derived from the law providing for equal rights,” to mean, any act which is authorized by a federal law protecting civil rights which is permitted by a federal law providing for equal rights which is protected by a federal law providing for equal rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.759" offset="11258441">The question of whether or not federal jurisdiction is proper in such cases is a question whether a statute governing the jurisdiction of courts should apply to pending cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2874.440" offset="11601168">And it was under the constitution that we originally sought to remove but unless this Court should find that because our pleadings are insufficient or for some other reason, Hamm and Lupper does not reach and protect this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.011" offset="11651427">There need be reach no constitutional question in this case nor any question as to whether Section 1443 and its phrase “law providing for equal rights” means anything under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.529" offset="11705448">Now, the State of Georgia has taken the position that an act under color of authority means an act under color of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.383" offset="11740871">And it is when that in effect that the federal officers and the persons acting under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.423" offset="11761037">And this is a position which has since been sustained by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the Peacock case although in Rogers in Tuscaloosa and other panel of the Fifth Circuit regarded the question it's still open there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.293" offset="11820596">The third possible construction of Section 1443 (2) which should command the consideration of the Court is that by Judge Friendly in the Galamison case in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.128" offset="11871901">Judge Friendly without resolving the question whether the phrase color of authority meant color of office and whether the statute does reach anybody other than officers and persons acting under them said that authority derived from the federal law, only a federal law directed a specific act to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.961" offset="11947238">An act was authorized by under color of authority of law if it was a direction given by that law to do the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.672" offset="11974092">We think that doesn't amount to very much other than the construction that the statute is limited to officers and persons acting under them because no civil rights law that we know of directs anybody to do anything other than federal officers and persons acting under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.328" offset="12028635">So I think that the alternatives meaningfully in construction of 1443 (2) are simply, whether or not under color of authority means protected by federal law and does reaches demonstrators, sit-ins, and persons who are protected by federal law which precludes their prosecution or whether it is limited to federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.373" offset="12112854">And again for the moment without arguing, we're just simply pointing out what the alternatives mean at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.081" offset="12135737">I would point out that that second construction reached 1443 (2) off the books because Section 1442 (a) of the judicial code today allows removal on all federal office in cases of civil rights or otherwise including persons acting under federal office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.521" offset="12197491">Now passing the 1443 (1) again merely with the purpose of outlining what the issues are and what the possible constructions are, 1443 (1) unlike 1443 (2) asks a question not --</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.833" offset="12462686">First of all, there is the construction of the Rives-Powers line of cases argued by Mr. Sparks this morning that the denial spoken off by Section 1443 (1) is a denial which arises from the face of a state statute or constitution, unconstitutional on its face that where that existed is both the necessary and sufficient condition of removal that no question can be asked whether the state courts will uphold the state statute albeit unconstitutional or will strike it down and that the one hallmark of removability is an unconstitutional state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.664" offset="12606046">A second possible interpretation is that when a removal petition is filed as it now must be filed in advance of trial, the federal court shall try case by case, issue by issue the question whether the removal petitioner is being denied or has been denied and cannot enforce in the state courts a right under the constitution and laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.803" offset="12702595">Now for the moment, I'm treating the words denied and cannot enforce as though they were tautologic.</text>

            <text syncTime="3756.820" offset="15130624">I believe that if a motion to abate were filed citing Hamm and Lupper in a state court that for the same reason that under Jackson and Denno, a state judge is required to try the federal constitutional issue of a confession at the federal -- that a state trial judge would be required to try without a jury the issue of whether or not the facts brought this case within Hamm and Lupper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.265" offset="15212440">I think that then a jury trial would have to be held on whether or not a state statute had been violated and I point out that in the event that this case came to conviction in a state court and was affirmed on appeal that when a federal habeas corpus petition was filed after state trial, a federal district judge sitting without jury would decide all over again if the case had not been removed and advanced at trial whether or not the petitioner's conduct fell within the state statute and whether or not it fall within the protection of Hamm and Lupper.</text>

            <text syncTime="3839.005" offset="15459349">We think Congress made the judgment that these cases should be tried to a federal judge in a federal court at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.272" offset="15500413">If this case is now decided against removal, let me hypothesis for a moment that the petitioner in this case (Inaudible) -- the respondents in this Court remove a petitioner in this case, Thomas Rachel comes to me and says to me, “I'd like to sit-in in one of the few remaining segregated restaurants in Atlanta or the many remaining segregated restaurants outside Atlanta, can I do it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.173" offset="15624025">What would I have to tell him?</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.510" offset="15629458">I would have to tell him, “Of course you can do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.692" offset="15638131">If the restaurant is covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress has said in so many words, "You have a right of equal access in the restaurant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.293" offset="15672508">And Congress has gone out of his way to say that not only have you got that but no person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, attempt to intimidate, threaten or coerce you for exercising it, you shall not be punished, no person shall attempt to punish you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.346" offset="15724753">And then I would -- would be I think, a pretty bad lawyer if I stop there because what I ought to tell him is that if the restaurateur wanted to deny him service, he wouldn't do it on the ground that the restaurant wasn't covered by the Civil Rights Act anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.816" offset="15778670">He would do it precisely on the ground that there was some boisterousness or he would deny it on the ground that Rachel when he came in was ill-dressed or that he was drunk, whether he ogled the waitress or anyone of a whole host of other grounds which might give the restaurateur under the Georgia statute a right to exclude it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.992" offset="15855365">Now on that question of fact depends the effective enforcement of this Court's Hamm and Lupper decisions and the effective enforcement of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and we suppose that a Federal District Court was deemed by Congress to be a better form, a more appropriate form for the trial of this federal issue than a state judge or state jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.930" offset="15955048">If I had to tell Thomas Rachel in my hypothetical case, what he could expect in the event that the restaurateur denied him service on the ground that he was boisterous or annoys the -- or ogled the waitress, I would tell him that what would happen is that he would go trial and this Mr. Justice Fortas, goes back to the question of what in fact happens in the state court but not a particular state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.008" offset="16035401">State courts generally, I would tell him that the risk that he runs when he is arrested is that bail will set -- be set when as -- it was for one of the removal petitioners in this case, at $7000 for misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.349" offset="16088795">Now, it may well be that we can challenge that, we can bring other proceedings, habeas corpus in a state court or up to the state highest court go into a Federal District Court to challenge bail perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.677" offset="16134040">In the amount of time that it takes us to get a judge, you may have spent a night or you may have spent two nights in jail but we can eventually challenge it and perhaps we have to go through several courts to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.744" offset="16170297">Then what will happen to you is that you'll be brought to trial in a state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4112.180" offset="16552103">I intend to get just there and when I spoke of history, it was exactly in that sense that I meant that history was illuminating and indeed we think controlling in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.658" offset="16590033">I was merely pointing out why Congress could've made the judgment that we think it may.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.636" offset="16609886">Now, to establish that it did make the judgment, we have gone through the legislative history of the statute which passed a hundred years ago this month, laid the foundation for removal jurisdiction claimed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.792" offset="16678536">I ought to say that in connection with the legislative history, we do not claim any more than we do with respect to the language that there's anything in there specifically which compels this Court to the result we contend for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.582" offset="16729736">In the sense of any explanation of the statute on the floor of Congress or any supposition of the cases that would arise under it, the judiciary provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 were relatively undiscussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.082" offset="16783653">The structure of the original statute was to create original jurisdiction as well as removal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.827" offset="16814686">The only discussion of the provision at all was by Senator Trumbull, responsive to a criticism by President Johnson and his veto because the criticism was slanted, that only part of the jurisdiction, the response was only partial and we find no illumination in the specific legislative history but we find the extraordinary illumination in a larger panorama of history here because we think that if you go back and look at the history of use of the federal judiciary to enforce federal rights which is what we're talking about in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.978" offset="16951254">You find that the reconstruction period, the period in which the statute was enacted is the watershed that prior to the reconstruction period, the federal courts albeit the constitution, gave the Congress power to establish lower federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.675" offset="17014053">Lower federal courts were very seldom used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.932" offset="17023143">It wasn't even a general federal question jurisdiction as we know it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.376" offset="17036831">And a massive business, above the business which the federal courts do today, they were giving in the five or six years following the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.847" offset="17074761">Now, the second thing that I think stands out is one that looks back at the historical panorama is that the principle concern of the reconstruction Congress is which bulked up the jurisdiction of the federal courts and gave them the protected jurisdiction which they have today was with the pretention of the civil rights which were gained by the war, secured and assured by -- substantively by the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and by the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.741" offset="17190327">Every Civil Rights Act, everyone had jurisdictional provisions which gave the federal courts jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.590" offset="17217703">Now, let's take a look for one moment what that jurisdiction is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.158" offset="17232018">To start with, in cases without regard to a mail unlike general federal questions jurisdiction, the federal courts have civil jurisdiction in all cases involving civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.430" offset="17273083">They have it originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.502" offset="17285413">They have it in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.530" offset="17293458">They have it in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.825" offset="17302653">They have the habeas corpus jurisdiction given by a statute in 1867 whose clear purpose was to allow them to take from state custody, persons in restraint by the state executive with or without state judicial process where their federal rights were being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.423" offset="17365034">The federal courts, in short, have very extensive civil rights jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.382" offset="17384887">Now a question arises, did not Congress -- would not Congress have foreseen that the major threat perhaps to the civil rights just secured by the war and by the amendments would not come in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.910" offset="17439013">It would not come solely in cases in which the state executive was acting but was very often come in criminal prosecutions by the state in which the Freedmen and the unions is in itself were prosecuted and we know Congress knew this because the debates which we've set out at pages 45 to 66 of this brief, if they mean anything, mean that Congress knew that the state courts were hostile and that state court actions were being used to harass unionists and Negroes in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.409" offset="17544965">We asked, wouldn't Congress have done something about that and we conclude that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.373" offset="17564818">We look at the first thing they did in reconstruction, the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.424" offset="17589060">And that first thing they did, allows removal of civil and criminal cases in three basic categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.238" offset="17620302">The only one of them and the third is in issue here but the other two we think are very illuminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.671" offset="17638066">First of all, federal officers enforcing civil rights laws, whatever else Section 1443 (2) means, it certainly means and everybody agrees that a federal officer or unionist who is enforcing the Civil Rights Act could remove under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.957" offset="17695222">He wouldn't have to show case by case that the state courts were unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.325" offset="17708701">He wouldn't have to show that the state statute was unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.507" offset="17721448">The very fact that he was a federal officer involved in civil rights enforcement would allow them to remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.216" offset="17744227">Secondly, and I think this is extremely important although we don't rely on it specifically in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.266" offset="17768469">A state officer who refused to do an act on the ground that it will be inconsistent with civil rights law is permitted to remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.201" offset="17800129">A state officer, he is not a person protected by federal law, he is permitted to remove this case to a federal court simply because the issue of his authority which he refuses to exercise involves federal civil rights law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.901" offset="17858957">He doesn't have to show that the state courts are not fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.468" offset="17869197">He does not have to show that they will not sustain the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.777" offset="17882467">He does not have to show that there is a state statute unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.603" offset="17897827">All that he has to show is that he is a state officer, being prosecuted for an act or a failure to act in this case which he says would conflict with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.378" offset="17944848">We asked then if these two classes of persons, federal officers enforcing the law and state officers who refuse to violate it or for that reason alone, given the right to come into the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="4547.758" offset="18294366">We think that in cases like that, Congress made the conclusive presumption of law that because federal civil rights were involved in this case and because the potential for harassment of granting these cases through the state courts intermittently, the problems I raised earlier, trying them in front of a potentially hostile state judge who will influence what lawyers do by his very presence, who will influence the way witnesses testified, who has enormous discretion on questions of bail, who has enormous discretion on questions of timing and when the case comes before the Court, how long it shall be held up.</text>

            <text syncTime="5243.232" offset="21076302">I have one -- before we had any ground of the sort that we now seek to sustain removal on for removing and I think that the first opportunity that we have to raise the substantive claims here we could raise them again.</text>

            <text syncTime="5296.140" offset="21287894">So, I do not believe that if a federal court remands after finding that there's no constitutional protection that he is deprived of the opportunity of raising the federal issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="5379.634" offset="21621948">The further allegation is that they were arrested on this occasion for the sole purpose, and this is on page 1, of aiding, abetting and perpetuating customs and usages having historical and psychological roots with respect to serving in sitting members of the Negro race in places of public accommodation and convenience on a racially discriminatory basis and upon terms and conditions not imposed on members of the so-called White or Caucasian race.</text>

            <text syncTime="5527.069" offset="22211688">But we think that even if they did, the factual allegations are quite sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="5760.690" offset="23146141">But the statute said and this Court held in Hamm and Lupper that a state could not now punish pre-act conduct which was simply sitting in a restaurant seeking service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.164" offset="23192012">We think that at that point, a federal court which has the case is called upon just as this Court called on all state courts which had such cases in Hamm and Lupper to look at the case before it and decide whether or not the case is indeed a punishment, harassment, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.761" offset="23258467">If it is, we believe that that in itself falls into effect the removal statute which is intended to give federal jurisdiction to decide just such a question.</text>
