            <label>Mr. F. Lee Bailey</label>
            <text syncTime="24.263" offset="201415">For the petitioner Your Honor, Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.472" offset="218237">This case comes to this Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which on May 5th last reversed, two to one, a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, voiding the Ohio conviction of Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard which was recorded in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.812" offset="303606">The district judge in his opinion noted five independent federal constitutional violations, each of which in his judgment, warranted granting the writ of habeas corpus and he determined that the five of them constituted this case as it was tried and carried through the state courts a mockery of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.783" offset="387511">On July 3rd, 1954, Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard was an osteopathic neurosurgeon living in the hamlet of Bay Village, Ohio a few miles west of Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.186" offset="441114">He was 30 years old as was his young wife Marilyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.739" offset="455325">They have one child, age seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.189" offset="465147">They lived on the shore of Lake Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.601" offset="474760">He was a busy and successful doctor as were his two older brothers, both surgeons and his father, also a physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.020" offset="508510">The four of them run a clinic and they were active in the Bay View Hospital located in Bay Village.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.161" offset="541006">The Sheppards entertained that night some friends named Ahern.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.441" offset="554172">At some time during the evening while on television, a movie was being observed called, Strange Holiday, Dr. Sheppard fell asleep on the couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.931" offset="596072">The Aherns left some time around midnight and bade Marilyn Sheppard goodnight at the door and she was never seen alive again.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.969" offset="636301">Some time around six o’clock in the morning, a man leaving two doors distant from Dr. Sheppard, J. Spencer Houk the Mayor of Bay Village received a telephone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.118" offset="680918">He recognized the voice of the petitioner, who said words in substance, “Spen, come quick.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.761" offset="707459">I think they have killed Marilyn.”</text>
            <text syncTime="154.469" offset="722296">Mayor Houk got up and get dressed, got his wife up and got her dressed, and they got in the family automobile and drove about 75 yards to the Sheppard home.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.061" offset="768690">When they entered the home, they found Dr. Sheppard lying on the floor downstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.762" offset="787393">Mrs. Houk went upstairs and found Marilyn Sheppard lying in a pool of blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.780" offset="815501">Authorities arrived, the Bay Village Police, the Cleveland Police, the County Sheriffs office, the County Prosecutors office and the County Coroner’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.334" offset="849774">An investigation was immediately commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.213" offset="865238">No witness, save of Dr. Sheppard has ever reported any facts from his own knowledge as having occurred between midnight and six o’clock on the fourth day of July 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.024" offset="916543">And what Dr. Sheppard had to say was this and still is, “That at some time during the night and he does not know the time, he awoke from a deep sleep by what he imagined to be screaming and thought his wife who was then pregnant was having convulsions, that he rushed up the stairs to the bedroom which was on the second floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.685" offset="995119">And that the bedroom was dimly lit, and as he reached the top of the stairs or as he entered the bedroom, the point about which he was uncertain, he noticed a white shape or form, apparently a human form standing near the head of the bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.472" offset="1050290">As he entered the room and attempted to attack or grapple the form, he was struck from behind and rendered unconscious.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.548" offset="1078606">At some later point, he awoke on the floor of the bedroom and heard noises on the first floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.736" offset="1099295">He got up and run down the stairs.”</text>

            <text syncTime="258.158" offset="1137016">Dr. Sheppard said, he could not be sure except that it had a white top as it stood next to the bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.097" offset="1160735">I think it is a human being, the question being whether it was male or female, the question remaining in the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.566" offset="1230639">We see the state of the evidence in the record, it would have been impossible for the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.581" offset="1242760">Dr. Sheppard was about to attack to struck a rabbit punch in the back of his neck</text>
            <text syncTime="288.468" offset="1258224">.We believe there were two, one of whom was a woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.372" offset="1273898">As Dr. Sheppard charged down the stairs, he observed the man fleeing out the screen door toward the lake and he chased him.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.219" offset="1301274">He chased him down to certain wooden steps to the shore of the lake and their grappled with him and became in some manner held around the neck and was again rendered unconscious.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.273" offset="1385493">When Dr. Sheppard awoke for the third time, the Sun was breaking over Lake Erie and he says that he got up, he was half in and half out of the water and indeed later on the sand was found in his pants and trouser caps and his trousers were wet, his t-shirt was missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.736" offset="1451321">He ran up to the bedroom where his wife lay covered with blood, checked her pulse and found that she was gone, put his knee against the side of the bed as he did so and later it was discovered that the only blood showing on Dr. Sheppard was a spot on the knee diluted with water and then he went down the stairs and called Mayor Houk and then fell to the floor.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.630" offset="1570962">It's in my recollection that it had no traces of blood whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.765" offset="1583501">I don't believe that it was an important piece of evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.200" offset="1605235">Dr. Sheppard's older brothers Richard and Steve upon receiving notification of the tragedy, rushed to Sam's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.263" offset="1645464">Dr. Steven Sheppard made an examination of Sam Sheppard and determined that he was in shock that he had spasm in the neck and he ordered him removed to the Bay View Hospital and this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.439" offset="1694156">He was taken there by Dr. Steven and by an orderly who had responded to the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.153" offset="1717039">At Bay View Hospital, he was X-rayed and was found to have a bone chip in the second cervical vertebrae.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.744" offset="1739400">His teeth were loosened and he had severe bruises about the face.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.244" offset="1757372">He was questioned almost immediately by county authorities, who over the next two or three weeks questioned him intensively and extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.587" offset="1802721">Before the day was out, an accusation had been tossed to Dr. Sheppard that he was the number one suspect principally because no other suspects had turned out.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.712" offset="1835217">He was asked to take a lie detector test.</text>

            <label>Mr. F. Lee Bailey</label>
            <text syncTime="441.079" offset="1868758">Deputy Sheriff Carl Rossbach I believe was among the first who told him that he was a suspect and said, “Will you take a lie detector test?”</text>
            <text syncTime="449.719" offset="1903240">And Dr. Sheppard asked how it worked and was informed that it worked as a result of certain physiological phenomenon measured by a machine called the polygraph and he replied at that time, “I don't feel that my physical condition is sufficient to make the test accurate” and he declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.009" offset="1972412">Later on in the day because of the attitude of the police, the family lawyer [Inaudible] so he hired a well-known criminal lawyer, William J. Corrigan to give advice to the Sheppards because it was apparent that the trial was up.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.112" offset="2028837">The police demanded to interrogate Sheppard and they did interrogate him at sometimes under certain conditions set by Attorney Corrigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.169" offset="2065095">The newspapers of course reported this incident with every column inch they had available.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.004" offset="2096441">And for many days, speculation ran right from the community as to what sort of bushy-headed bloody monster was running about and ready to strike again.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.678" offset="2135103">But after a time, other news occurring here and there on the face of the earth began to force the Sheppard case out of page 1 column 1 and this disturbed according to a certain documented product which is reproduced in our petition for certiorari, the editor of a Cleveland newspaper with a circulation of 300,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.611" offset="2222874">And he felt -- he said that because Dr. Sam Sheppard was the police surgeon in Bay Village and because the family was well to do and well-known in Bay Village that the fix was in or something tantamount to influence covering up a murderer.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.735" offset="2279299">And so he says fearful that the case would drop out of the public mind and noticing that the other newspapers were beginning to turn their attentions elsewhere, he unleashed his editorial artillery.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.048" offset="2328618">His paper, the Cleveland Press kept the case on page 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.416" offset="2354009">Thereafter an article was published or I should say an editorial saying that someone was getting away with murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.797" offset="2379609">This editorial appeared on the front page directly below as statement, Sheppard sat for a new quiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.572" offset="2406672">The plain import of the editorial was that Dr. Sam Sheppard was getting away with murder, but nobody moved to arrest him perhaps for lack of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.499" offset="2450348">Then the Cleveland Press demanded that the Cleveland police take over the investigation because they are by far the more competent and after all Dr. Sheppard would not have the his influence with the Cleveland police and with an hour of two of this editorial demand, the Cleveland police were called in by the fathers of Bay Village and then the press demanded that the Coroner called an inquest.</text>

            <text syncTime="7543.157" offset="30277026">Now I wish to mention very briefly two remaining issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="7547.229" offset="30293326">First, on the lie detector evidence, it is true that although tardy the objection was made to the introduction of evidence that Sheppard have refused the lie detector, it was not appealed to the Ohio courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7558.206" offset="30337212">Judge Blythin, I'm sorry, Judge Weinman, I believe as I read Fay against Noia had the authority if he saw fit to interpose as a bar to Sheppard's claim of this constitutional violation waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="7570.448" offset="30386218">He did not elect to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="7572.155" offset="30393010">The Sixth Circuit usurped that function and speculated that Corrigan wanted the jury to know this fact and therefore waived objections to his admissibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="7580.253" offset="30425401">I think this was unwarranted and I think it was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="7583.123" offset="30436895">The Sixth Circuit also ruled that the phone calls from the jurors to their homes which were not monitored.</text>
            <text syncTime="7589.465" offset="30462286">The bailiffs testified that they could only hear the words spoken, not the words received by the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="7595.402" offset="30486006">It did not give rise to a presumption of prejudice such as this Court has held in many similar circumstances and therefore, although the district judge took note of all these presumptions and did not require petitioner to produce the evidence, suddenly in the Circuit Court we find that we should have and therefore we are foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7612.348" offset="30553819">I think that as to the other issues, I must leave them to the brief due to time limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7616.120" offset="30568866">I think that the Sixth Circuit paid short trip to the district judge's opinion that they took away his power to find the facts and disregarded it as you will find in their amended order and that they should at least have sent the case back for remand so that many of the issues not yet litigated should have been but I think there's more than enough here to warrant the issuance of the writ and I think that Dr. Sheppard ought to be retried if the company has any -- I'm sorry, the county has any stomach for this case left within the 60 days allowed by the district judge, I thank Your Honors.</text>
