            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 52, Dan Tehan, Sheriff of Hamilton County, Ohio, petitioner, versus United States ex rel. Edgar I. Shott, Jr.</text>

            <label>Mr. Calvin W. Prem</label>
            <text syncTime="25.532" offset="205511">Chief Justice Warren and Associate Justices, I'm here in behalf of Sheriff Dan Tehan who is the petitioner, Sheriff of Hamilton County, Cincinnati, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.407" offset="252949">He succeeded or he became a party in this case at the stage of proceedings when it reached the habeas corpus stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.179" offset="296103">Prior to that, this case which is a criminal case involved the state -- people of the State of Ohio against the defendant, Edgar I. Shott.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.986" offset="347303">The only question presented to this Court for decision is actually whether or not this Court's decision in the Griffin against California case just this year, should be applied retrospectively or prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.839" offset="438732">The facts in the two cases are almost identical except in that they involve different kinds of crimes insofar as the factual background of this case might be of some general interest to the Court although the facts themselves have nothing to do with the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.467" offset="509262">I would like to say that -- and since this case has had references made to its involving securities violations, I would like to say that the actual crime involved was in the nature of a ponzi deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.544" offset="585540">It was in the nature of a securities manipulation and it involved a number of persons other than this defendant and when it came to light several persons were indicted each charged with violations of the Ohio Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.493" offset="665370">In particular, this defendant was charged with two counts, One, with selling securities without a license and the other in selling unregistered securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.637" offset="717928">As clearly stated as I can put it, it's something like the law that says “You can't fish without a license and if you fish and don't have a license, you're in violation of that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.228" offset="760247">From that point on, this trial was extremely brief although it covered a period of about three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.980" offset="791280">I say extremely brief because there were only two witnesses who were called and at that point, the state rested its case and there was no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.376" offset="840913">There were opening statements made by counsel on both sides and in the opening statement for the defendant, there were certain admissions made which touched upon the requirements to be proved by the State in proving its case against this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.696" offset="906115">Now in presenting the issue to the Court as to whether or not it's Griffin against California decision should be applied retrospectively, it is my position, it is the position of the State of Ohio as proponents that it not be applied retrospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.092" offset="983751">That in this case for reasons which I would go into, this decision, Griffin against California should be given prospective application and that that prospective application should in fact be applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.872" offset="1050833">I say that and at the risk of being too brief, I am relying heavily upon this Court's decision in the Linkletter case which followed Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.730" offset="1106317">The decision had a thorough review of the arguments for and against prospective or retrospective application, had a -- an intelligent review of the reasons behind decisions that have been given prospective application and decisions which have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.783" offset="1198477">And I feel that the similarities between the two principles that are involve although the Linkletter case had to do with the evidence rule of the Mapp case and this has to do with the comment by the prosecution in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.681" offset="1282069">Although those are different, I feel that the principles involved are the same and that for that reason, the reasoning in the Linkletter case can be identically applied in arriving at the same conclusion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.981" offset="1351346">As I indicated to this Court in my factual statement, the trial was had, the jury found the defendant guilty of having sold securities without a license and of selling an unregistered security.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.227" offset="1396276">The defendant did not take the stand, comment about his failure to testify, an explain was made by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.376" offset="1432848">I was one of the prosecuting attorneys who actually presented the case for the state and my co-counsel, the prosecutor whose comments are the basis for this appearance unfortunately had a heart attack earlier this year and died.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.864" offset="1490840">In fact, while we were here and he had his first seizure, but other than that, the reasoning that this Court put forward leads me to say that it might be suggested today that it would be fantastic, I believe that is exactly the way it was stated in the respondent's brief, it would be fantastic to deny the retrospective application to all cases that have ever been tried since the year one.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.326" offset="1608704">And I submit that this approach is not so that if we would consider that to be fantastic and if we would feel that we would have to apply this retrospectively to all cases such as in the Gideon case then we would get enmeshed in a dog chasing its tail type of situation where there would be no end.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.436" offset="1705148">Instead this type of rule, the evidence principles of this rule requires that we have a starting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.944" offset="1743182">And as this Court judiciously and legally and clearly stated in its Linkletter case, it got the look at several things involved in the case being considered before making a determination, a final determination of prospectivity or retrospectivity.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.379" offset="3416900">And it is further strengthened by way of evidence that was actually adduced at the trial that the note that was given and which is claimed to have been one of the exempted transactions in that it was -- it's claimed to have been a private transaction, the note was signed Ed Shott Investment Company by Ed Shott rather than as an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.492" offset="3513344">So I say that although the trial itself was brief, there was evidence from which this jury could and did determine exactly what it set out to determine, that is the guilt or innocence of the accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.714" offset="5110262">And I say thoroughly, I think advisably because the appeal that -- there were two bites all the way up to the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.546" offset="5137533">In other words, an appeal to the First District Court of Appeals in Ohio and the judgment of conviction was affirmed and then there was a reapplication for a rehearing and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.755" offset="5174418">And then to the Ohio Supreme Court two times and then here on a petition which was denied and then a reapplication and then we got into the habeas corpus in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.193" offset="5220185">But if in using the thinking that this Court used in Linkletter, if this Court feels that we are dealing -- if we can distinguish between what this Court referred as being evidentiary rules as against basic rights such as were involved in the Griffin against Illinois case where the indigent prisoner wasn't able to appeal because he couldn't pay for the transcript or the Gideon case, the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.322" offset="5336691">If we can say alright, those are basic rights that preclude the giving of a fair trial and in those cases of necessity we must make the rules retrospective that can be understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.878" offset="5390921">And then the distinction on the other side being that as far as rules of evidence are concerned whether or not, illegally obtained evidence disturbs the -- or interferes with a fair trial or whether or not comment by an attorney on the accused failure to take the stand actually disturbs or disrupts the fairness of the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.329" offset="5468662">If these are two different avenues, then in the evidentiary category, the rule should not be made retrospective but prospective only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.166" offset="5504084">To do it retrospective would I think, upset the vested rights if we can use this phraseology of the public at large who have prior to the new decision relied upon their constitutional guarantee and I don't know if I brought it with me, I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.438" offset="5593109">I wanted to make one comment that the procedure in Ohio being that once we get past the directed verdict, our procedure being in reliance on this constitutional provision, then we have a right to continue that reliance until such time, as this Court has changed it, which was at the time of its Malloy decision or subsequently the Griffin decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.556" offset="5745560">We take the position on the bribe question that the decision in Griffin must be made retroactive and we take further position that regardless of whether it is retroactive or prospective, there is no possibility that it can be used to reverse the judgment of the court below and further that the case was pending at the time of Griffin under the rule in Linkletter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.647" offset="5898010">Now I want to restate the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.252" offset="5912430">We believe because there is not a word in this record that this defendant had any, the relator had any connection with the ponzi scheme of a man named Stickler, not a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.713" offset="5974183">There is not a line in this record that shows any inference of guilt at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.144" offset="6007933">He testified, the witness where the State testified that he had gone to his friend and had made a speculative loan and he received a note back and the note had been made paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.241" offset="6104377">The realtor thought that he had met the burden of proof which the Ohio law apparently puts upon the transaction such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.312" offset="6164668">The Ohio law says that there must be a public offering, a public offering in the pretty large corner before a note can be treated, the issuance of a promissory note can be treated as violations about the security law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.693" offset="6266128">Here although they had investigated the situation, they chose to prove only one single transaction and that would alone [Inaudible] to the State's witnesses and that's all And then they relied on the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.957" offset="6351182">They said that shifted the burden of proof, that innocent transaction shifted the burden of proof to to explain it on to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.963" offset="6403218">And finally, the prosecutor commented on this evidence in a way which we had some time when we appealed before Griffin on law that certainly did not come within the Adamson rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.522" offset="6469465">The Adamson rule, as we understood it, allowed the prosecutor to comment upon the defendant's failure to explain evidence against him and here there wasn't a line of evidence that needed explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.877" offset="6542921">So he didn't take the stand and in the prosecutor at length commented upon his failure to take the stand, I guess – one example from page 6 of my brief and there he sits for just one reason because he can't look you in the eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.201" offset="6616168">He can't tell you that because it isn't so because there was more than one transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.482" offset="6641351">There was a multiplicity of transactions and that is where the crime has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.720" offset="6670294">It's now an objection previous to this, there's a lot of conversation, the objection is overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.441" offset="6693177">So here is the prosecutor testifying [Inaudible] back to the Court that this was a public offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.730" offset="6730271">And we thought that that did not -- could not possibly be included even under the Adamson rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.764" offset="6778441">On December 2, 1962, we appealed and filed in orderance a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.390" offset="6832880">The court held that until May 13, 1963 and incidentally the decision -- the -- in 1963 -- in October 1963, a certiorari was filed in Griffin whereas our certiorari was filed in December of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.749" offset="6938415">And on May 13th, our appeal and orderance writ of certiorari was denied, Justice Black dissenting on the ground of probable jurisdiction had been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.057" offset="6991600">Now had that been granted, that certiorari it would be Griffin without here saying that this thing should retroactively apply to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.283" offset="7040502">It wouldn't be a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.945" offset="7047189">In other words, it's a result with a pure matter of luck in the race to the Supreme Court that Griffin got here first although his petition in certiorari wasn't filed the next year after ours was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.114" offset="7107793">Then on June 24, 1963, which was the day after the mandate came down from denial of our appeal on the certiorari, we filed a habeas corpus, a petition for habeas corpus in the District Court and in that petition, we raised the constitutionality of shifting the burden of proof under the meaning of transaction, the fairness of the trial on the Adamson rule, and also the constitutionality of the Adamson decision itself and the Court held that for about five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.163" offset="7267976">The court decided that quicker, we would have beaten Griffin to this Court because in Griffin, the certiorari was filed October, 1963 in the case which was decided in May 28, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.446" offset="7337148">So we first point out that surely in -- there were two proceedings are being brought to the Supreme Court and one is decided before the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.697" offset="7382183">It would be impossible to say that this purchase of the form of proceeding by means, on decided proceeding was on pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.531" offset="7417501">Now in the second case which took place, we point out that if Griffin is to be given a prospective effect, it must be purely prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.507" offset="7465357">It must relay, it must leave previous cases where and previous individuals where they were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.442" offset="7501093">But in order to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, the State has to claim although he haven't reached the argument, they have to claim that it is prospective as to all individuals but retroactive in the sense that the Court will go back and of reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals which the Court admit was correctly decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.355" offset="8084773">In the petition, we denied -- we've raised the point as to the burden of proof and the fairness of trial and -- I mean the burden of proof ploy, the fairness of trial and we asserted that even under Adam -- Adamson, this kind of comment would not be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.634" offset="8165857">And you could say, I think or technical, that we did not raise the precise point in the petition for serve which I have filed copies of the petition cert that Adamson was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.631" offset="8225938">But I think that this Court had taken certiorari unquestionably that question would have come up and we did raise a precise point that Adamson was unconstitutional in our proceedings for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.704" offset="8286229">And that with a little more luck could have reached the Supreme Court before the decision in Griffin which was April 28, 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.831" offset="8350699">So I see no -- I see no possible way of saying that this case was not pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.431" offset="8385076">I suppose the only argument could be made and it is made is that habeas corpus is sometimes of a collateral proceeding and we only look as what's pending in -- on the great proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.665" offset="8445994">But surely those contentions can no longer be made after Fay versus Noia where the Court that Mr. Justice Brennan encouraged people not to bring certiorari at all and so I do not see -- I've been [Inaudible] said but said not defending and the fact is that it is still passing if the test is looking and adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.691" offset="8546095">It is still pending in the Court of Common Pleas in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.137" offset="8559888">There is a mandate there which directs the Court even to try, it's stated January 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.852" offset="8590817">It directs the Court even to try relate or -- or to release him within 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.515" offset="8617462">And the release I suppose that maybe suspended that 90 days gone by but I suppose that was suspended by the proceeding for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.475" offset="8657272">So it's pending on the docket, it's pending within the rule of the Linkletter and even if it wasn't pending, you couldn't use it to reverse a corrected deciding case by the Court of Appeals without saying to the Court of Appeals now don't decide these cases until your first crime whether we're going to cite -- make the decision retroactive or not otherwise you will have to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.266" offset="8776391">This saying doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.891" offset="8786944">Now as to the broader question, we have suggested in our brief that perhaps this case is not a proper vehicle to bring up -- bring the issue of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.247" offset="8864371">In view of the fact that two cases, one in California and the other in Ohio have been decided stating that this decision is only prospective and not retroactive, we will draw this suggestion that because it might be considered a dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.254" offset="8956426">This rule should not be decided in this case because other state courts, this will become through other state courts and I do not think that the rule against dicta or the rule that where you can decide the case on a broader ground or a narrower ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.040" offset="9039496">You should always decide on a narrower ground should apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.086" offset="9059767">I think this case the Court should act and decide the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.157" offset="9080038">Now, I will argue the principle issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.539" offset="9097488">I say that under the decision in Linkletter, this case, the Griffin decision, must be given a retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.996" offset="9143359">Now what standard, Mr. Justice Clark laid down in Linkletter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.528" offset="9165511">The first standard was did the state rely on the former decision, the former decision in Linkletter was brought back and the answer to that, of course in our case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.709" offset="9218173">The State did rely upon Adamson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.098" offset="9235728">Then the second standard that Mr. Justice Clark laid down was what was the purpose of the ruling in the former case which it refers to?</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.472" offset="9293302">Obviously in Mapp, the purpose did not concern that trial itself or any part of the appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.348" offset="9344815">It related only to the pre trial efforts of the prosecutor to get evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.204" offset="9380237">It was not part of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.607" offset="9401762">It could not be said that the trial itself was not fair because the evidence was completely relevant and the majority in Griffin had said, that this pretrial conduct that the prosecutor had to be disciplined and that was the real purpose of the rule in Mapp and that cannot be said here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.546" offset="9525582">Here in the --here the constitutional effect was part of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.876" offset="9554840">If the Court have decided that it was not a fair trial where comment on the failure of the defendant to take the stand was made by the prosecutor and that is ample proof by the time the comment should get in the particular kind of comment we got in the -- this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.910" offset="9650970">So that -- and then the Court finally test, the third test laid down by the Griffin case was what effect does the new decision have upon the administration of justice and they pointed out that whether a -- an evidence obtained -- an evidence was obtained by illegal search and seizure is a very complication, factual product on which judges are constantly differing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.123" offset="9799868">The Court pointed out the tremendous burden it would be to try such factual issues over again and let's contest that with the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.053" offset="9871548">Here the only factual issue which is to be determined is the factual issue whether the prosecutor commented and in 99 cases out of 100, that will be right on the record and in the 100th case where the record is lost, the burden of proof of that comment will be on the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.858" offset="9982830">So that so far as they're being complicated factual issues of concern, there isn't a possibility of the kind of effect on the administration of justice which this Court feared in Linkletter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.508" offset="10061406">So this leaves the offense of the position that the Mapp -- which the decision should not be retroactive solely to an argument which had not yet been made that the argument that this will be a great big jail delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.850" offset="10146774">Well I think if it would, the other cases Gideon hasn't been and there might be some statistics shown by the Court to indicate jail delivery and perhaps that's a reason they don't mention in jail delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.532" offset="10205497">But I'd like to point out to this Court that jail delivery by itself, the fear of a lot of people getting loose who were tried have been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.401" offset="10248965">In the Griffin versus Illinois, the failure to furnish a free contract that was on the appeal was made retroactive in the case of Eskridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.149" offset="10311973">And in the Gideon case, the – it was made retroactive by Doughty versus Maxwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.321" offset="10360665">Both of these cases involved the fairness of the trial and the idea that maybe somebody might get loose was not considered sufficient justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.471" offset="10405282">And indeed in Linkletter itself, Mr. Justice Clark points out, that the mere fact that an innocent man or a guilty man might be freed is not sufficient to cause to raise this for not making the case retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.095" offset="10487724">So I assert to this Court that under the test of Linkletter, this case must be made retroactive and second, that whether whatever test you put it on, it cannot be made prospective in the sense that no one cannot take advantage of it who did not have a pending case under the same retroactive to reverse a correct decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.836" offset="10630666">That is impossible I say also that it was pending and now I have not briefed and argued the issues which were presented to the Court of Appeals prior to their two paragraph decision after the Malloy case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.962" offset="10739231">Those issues are one; can the State shift the burden of the proof to the defendant to explain an innocent man?</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.289" offset="10788551">If I have brought one end of the note to the bank, must I prove that I haven't issued so many notes just to make a public transaction and say that in the Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.899" offset="10830973">And second we say that retroactive or not retroactive, the -- this particular comment was not -- would not deprive the defendant of a fair trial even under adversaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.089" offset="10895757">Now those matters, we have not briefed them because I felt that the case couldn't without [Inaudible] but if the Court disagreed to this, you will -- the clerk allowed us to put our jurisdictional statements and arguments [Inaudible] I think they're certified -- we have certified copies in the Court, I think that the Court disagrees my argument here, it should go into those other questions.</text>
