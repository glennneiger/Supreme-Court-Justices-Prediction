            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Numbers 21, 22, 26, and 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.280" offset="128502">Mr. Attwell, you may proceed with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Evans Attwell</label>
            <text syncTime="10.774" offset="146474">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.495" offset="161311">I appear here on behalf of Ocean Drilling and Exploration Company, the petitioner in Number 26 and a respondent in Numbers 21 and 22 and 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.591" offset="217736">At the outset, I would like to turn to the price increase moratorium imposed by the Commission in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.571" offset="253680">And in particular to respond to Mr. Justice Harlan's questions yesterday as to whether triggering was an issue in the hearings before the Commission and whether there was evidence to show that the filing of price increases above 23.55 cents per Mcf would trigger price increases in other contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.153" offset="359946">To both questions, the answer is, “No”.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.146" offset="375933">The Commission imposed the price increase moratorium without notice or hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.909" offset="402996">This condition is not even discussed in the presiding examiner's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.164" offset="428074">Contrary to Mr. Brown's statement yesterday, it is not perfectly obvious that the filing of any price increase above 23.55 cents would trigger an upsurge of prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.636" offset="493902">There is simply no evidence of record to support the 23.55 cent level or the July 1, 1967 cutoff date used by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.362" offset="548864">There is an attachment to the Commission staffs and memorandum of position which appears in the record and this purports to show that triggering would occur at the 23.55 cents price.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.818" offset="606647">However, this memorandum of position was never introduced into evidence, wasn't -- never cross-examined and we were never given the opportunity to present any rebuttal evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.532" offset="661504">I do not believe that such memorandum did or was intended to constitute evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.810" offset="690657">I might also point out to the Court that there is evidence in the record that shows as early as 1959 or 1960 that the Commission certificated prices for sales of gas from South Louisiana which are being made today at a price of 24.05 cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.601" offset="773726">Some mentioned was made yesterday as to whether this point of error was properly reserve -- preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.926" offset="803088">I would simply ask the Court to look at the application for rehearing filed on behalf of my client appearing at record page 603.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.555" offset="845615">I believe that this point of error is adequately preserved.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="188.963" stopTime="193.529">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="188.963" offset="859199">Was that the first point at which you could've taken -- could've noted it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_evans_attwell" startTime="193.529" stopTime="600.554">
            <label>Mr. J. Evans Attwell</label>
            <text syncTime="193.529" offset="877484">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.582" offset="881664">Since the -- it was not raised at all in the hearings or in the examiner's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.799" offset="906533">We had no notice or opportunity to object to this provision at an earlier time.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.520" offset="933491">Further as Mr. Justice Stewart noted yesterday, the court below did not make any finding as to whether triggering would occur at the 23.05 cent price but merely assumed that there was a factual basis for the Commission's finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.361" offset="1008828">I would like now to turn briefly to the Commission's exclusion of all evidence in this case except that of selected certificated prices in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.389" offset="1052923">We agree with the court below that the Commission erred in excluding all cost, economic and financial evidence tended to show that our proposed prices were the lowest, reasonable prices consistent with the maintenance of adequate gas supplies to meet the needs of the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.526" offset="1145501">We do not say that the Commission should not determine the in-line price.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.800" offset="1166608">On the contrary, we recognized as did the court below that whether a proposed price is in line with other prices in the area is an important and some time decisive factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.213" offset="1232227">We do say that if the Commission determines that a proposed price is out of line, it must receive and consider other evidence tendered to show that the proposed price is consistent with the public convenience and necessity even if such price is out of line with other certificated prices in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.381" offset="1332851">Counsel for the Commission stated yesterday that the Commission had determined that it was not in the public interest to certificate a price about 20 cents per Mcf. in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.064" offset="1387604">But how does the Commission reach that conclusion without even considering the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.260" offset="1408397">We intended to show that our prices were consistent with the interest of the consumer and the producer alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.459" offset="1441207">The Commission had a statutory duty to consider such evidence in determining whether our prices were in the present or future public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.795" offset="1482585">This is particularly true since under Section 7 of the Act, we, the producers, have the burden of proof to show that our proposed prices are in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.502" offset="1529396">Therefore, we are entitled to an opportunity to meet this burden and refusing to consider any evidence in this case except that of selected certificated sales in the area, the Commission has denied us this opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.068" offset="1599613">Ironically, the Commission claims that its evidentiary exclusion is founded upon this Court's decision in the CATCO case.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.430" offset="1641096">However, CATCO was reversed because the Commi -- producers had not presented sufficient evidence to support unconditional certification of their proposed price.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.770" offset="1698461">In reversing, this Court admonished the Commission to hold the line but it also told the Commission to consider all factors bearing upon the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.939" offset="1767111">The Commission has taken to hold the line admonition but it has completely disregarded the Court's statement that it was obligated to consider all factors bearing on the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.324" offset="1828655">We believe that in the present case, the Court is confronted with almost the reverse of the situation which confronted in CATCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.486" offset="1869302">There, the producers and the Commission sought to sustain permanent certification of their proposed prices on a minimal evidentiary showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.221" offset="1924263">Here, the Commission and various intervenors seek to sustain a reduction and proposed prices based upon the same type of minimal evidentiary showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.905" offset="1982986">We believe that Section 7 of the Act and this Court's CATCO decision require something in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.728" offset="2018304">It is our position that the Commission cannot determine the lowest reasonable rate consistent with the maintenance of adequate gas supplies to meet the needs of the consumer, if it limits its consideration to selected certificated prices in a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.287" offset="2096567">And what reasons do the Commission and other petitioners give to support this exclusion of all economic evidence, cost and financial evidence, and all other evidence except that of selected certificated prices in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.953" offset="2163231">At no time have they denied that the evidence proffered was relevant to a determination of the present and future public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.899" offset="2207013">Instead, they urge that this Court authorize the in-line price concept because the administrative process will break down.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.477" offset="2249331">Well, the overwhelmed to buy a mountain of economic and cost evidence which will make it basically impossible for the Commission to perform its statutory function.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.988" offset="2295306">We believe that the Commission has greatly exaggerated this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.781" offset="2314533">The alleged sector of an administrative monstrosity simply does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.255" offset="2336371">The Commission paints a picture of being confronted with hundreds of producer certificate applications which will create administrative chaos if you'd consider it individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.935" offset="2383078">Yet the Commission's annual reports to Congress show that 97% of all producer certificate applications do not even require formal hearings even in the remaining 3% of the cases, the hearings will not be unduly extended as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.604" offset="2469804">It is the Commission's practice to consolidate for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.209" offset="2484224">All pending producer certificate applications from a particular area as in this case --</text>

            <text syncTime="618.329" offset="2576697">Of course Mr. Chief Justice, we were not parties to those hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.385" offset="2592893">We do not know what that evidence was identical to the evidence we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.907" offset="2619016">We believe that our evidence in this case is material to a determination of the public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.122" offset="2655901">I will say in those other cases that the Government refers to if the evidence was of the same nature that the evidence hindered in this case, I believe it was error for them not to at least consider the evidence and see if conditions had changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.141" offset="2723924">Oh, wouldn't that go to the decision of whether the administrative process would break down if they had to repeat all of this voluminous testimony as to the economic factors in every single case that comes along if they -- if they're already apprised of the situation?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Evans Attwell</label>
            <text syncTime="675.044" offset="2803545">I don't think Mr. Chief Justice that they're necessarily already apprised of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.762" offset="2822457">I think that this evidence is continually changing that we speak of that the evidence they may have heard two, three, four, five years ago is not the same evidence that we're presenting today.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.031" offset="2879509">The needs of the consumer are changing, the adequacy of gas supplies that's a constantly changing thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.328" offset="2920678">I believe that as in this case also, the Government's burden would be materially reduced by the fact that most of the evidence in this consolidated hearings is presented jointly by the producer so you don't have just every bit -- every producer presenting a complete case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.464" offset="3001240">Further, the Commission couldn't re -- materially reduce the quantity of evidence presented if it would indicate some of the evidentiary criteria, it would consider justifying out of line prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.377" offset="3056828">I believe yesterday that Mr. Justice Harlan asked a question as to whether the Commission had given the producers any such evidentiary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.046" offset="3099564">Well, to my knowledge and I've been practicing before the Commission since 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.586" offset="3117746">I have never seen such evidentiary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.612" offset="3129866">And if I recall correctly, one of the petitioners in this case, not my client, actually filed a petition with the Commission asking that they declare such standards and the Commission simply responded saying, you have the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.138" offset="3195904">You present the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.676" offset="3202069">We will determine whether it is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.858" offset="3214817">As matters now stand without any guidelines from the Commission we are forced to try to justify our proposed prices by every possible evidentiary criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.379" offset="3260897">As a result, the records are somewhat voluminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.459" offset="3277197">Admittedly, consideration of evidence other than that of certificated sales in an area will require some additional effort on the part of the Commission and the intervenors.</text>

            <text syncTime="962.534" offset="3953560">However, even if additional effort is required by the Commission, it is simply part of their regulatory responsibility under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.998" offset="4003401">If they wish to change the statutory standard of public convenience and necessity, their plea should be directed to Congress and not to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.668" offset="4042062">The Commission and the intervenors argue that we seek to convert every certificate proceeding into a Section 4 or Section 5 rate hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.042" offset="4095561">All we seek is an opportunity to support our contract prices which were competitively negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.776" offset="4126490">We do not seek to have the Commission to allow as our cost no matter how high they may be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.819" offset="4246653">As this Court held in CATCO, such just and reasonable rate determinations are appropriately left to Section 4 and Section 5 rate proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.053" offset="4291584">All that we ask is the opportunity to meet our statutory burden to show that our proposed prices are consistent with the present and future public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.391" offset="4344978">We do not believe that considerations of administrative convenience can be used to deny the admissibility of relevant efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.706" offset="4390222">In summary, we believe that the Commission's exclusion of all economic cost and financial evidence is contrary to Section 7 of the Act and to this Court's CATCO decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.661" offset="4446020">In my remaining time, I would like to turn to Number 26 where we contend that on the facts of this case, the Commission does not have authority under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act to retroactively apply a price reduction by ordering reparations of amounts previously collected pursuant to unconditional, permanent certificates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.858" offset="4762833">We believe that the Commission committed fundamental error in arbitrarily holding that all prices above 18.5 cents per Mcf. for sales from South Louisiana were infected by the CATCO price.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.526" offset="4905462">Further, we believe that the exclusion of all these prices without regard to whether they were appealed or not, constitutes in effect a collateral attack upon prior file orders of the Commission, what the Commission has done is simply in effect said, those orders were invalid and why do they say they were invalid?</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.616" offset="5005876">Because they were subject to the same defect as the CATCO price was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.581" offset="5237739">I will say that was in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.382" offset="5244949">If you will recall in the brief to this Court, we pointed out that the exclusion of those 18.5 cents price is in making an in-line price determination, was not raised on the petitions for certiorari and that they were not argued by counsel yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.282" offset="5332511">We asked this Court to permit us to file a supplemental brief in the event it wished to determine the propriety of the Commission's in-line price determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.102" offset="5403773">Turning again to the issue in Number 26, I might point out that neither the court below nor the Commission nor New York nor United Gas Improvement Company purport to find any statutory power to support the ordering of reparations in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.037" offset="5495515">Instead, they urge that inherent power should be implied for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.532" offset="5525504">First, it is contended that such power should be implied because we assume that the risk of making refunds when we commit deliveries under our original unconditional certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.008" offset="5583391">But this argument assumes the very question before the Court for if the Commission does not have the authority to order reparations then we assume no risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.962" offset="5631248">Second, it is argued that unless reparation power is implied here, we will receive a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.778" offset="5666461">First, we do not believe that the question of the Commission's authority under the Natural Gas Act is dependent upon the failure of a party to exercise expressed statutory remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.010" offset="5727378">However, aside from that fundamental defect, the only evidence tendered in this case shows that even at present contract prices including those at issue here, we will not recover our cost by approximately $3.8 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.982" offset="5795297">If we are required to make reparations, this revenue deficiency simply will be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.946" offset="5823195">We believe that if anybody is getting a windfall in this case, it is the pipeline purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.877" offset="5850885">Finally, it is claimed that inherent reparation power must be implied in this case in order to afford the consumer a complete bond of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.189" offset="5896129">However, this argument ignores the fact that the expressed provisions of the Natural Gas Act if timely exercised would have provided such complete bond of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.784" offset="5950464">Powers which are not in the Act should not be implied to compensate for the failure to invoke the expressed provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.644" offset="5993932">This is particularly true when to imply such powers could expose the consumer the potential retroactive rate increases of tens of millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.202" offset="6048162">During the pendency of New York's original appeal in this case, a stay or other judicial order under Section 19 of the Act was available to protect New York's rights in the event it was successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.911" offset="6111065">Mr. Brown yesterday stated that it would be ridiculous, suicidal to require him to get a stay to prevent us for making deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.948" offset="6155160">First, I believe that it was Mr. Brown's decision to make in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.180" offset="6180133">But if -- in addition to that, I believe that there were other judicial remedies that a court could -- has inherent power to issue itself such as an order either staying our deliveries or permitting us to make them subject to a refund condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.915" offset="6255052">This is the expressed protection provided by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.052" offset="6271561">It is mandatory under the Act since Section 19 expressly provides that the filing of an appeal from an order of the Federal Power Commission does not act as a stay of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.397" offset="6324955">This is the protection which we obtained from the court below before processing the present appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.781" offset="6354526">New York argues that a stay is not necessary to protect the rights of a party appealing an order of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.197" offset="6384201">In other words, it would rewrite Section 19 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.850" offset="6398725">However, if New York is correct, then consumers may be faced with retroactive rate increases totaling millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.288" offset="6432475">For example, in the recent Permian Basin Area Rate decision, the Commission reduced -- produced the rates by some $20 million or $30 odd million dollars a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.864" offset="6474794">Under New York's theory, even if the producers do not obtain a stay of the Commission's order, it would make no difference or if they ultimately prevail on their appeals, they will be entitled to recoup what they have lost by an erroneous order of the Commission by a retroactive rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.043" offset="6547519">Further, when New York's appeal was remanded by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in this case, the Commission could have issued temporary certificates to us to continue our sales subject to an expressed condition to make refunds of amounts thereafter collected in excess of the price finally determined on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.743" offset="6638320">This is the procedure authorized by Section 7 of the Act and is the procedure that was followed by the Commission after the remand in CATCO and after the remand in many other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.427" offset="6693073">However, in our case, the Commission did not do so and cannot do so now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.911" offset="6718986">Thus, the Natural Gas Act contains expressed provisions which would have provided the consumer with a complete bond of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.787" offset="6758484">There is no reason to imply inherent powers to the Commission which are not necessary and which could have adverse effects on consumers as well as producers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2110.418" offset="8545050">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.530" offset="8573471">I would like to comment for just a moment about the present in-line approach that goes to the questions that two or three members have asked in the last few moments having to do with what we do in by question the so-called suspect price doctrine in determining the line of price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.416" offset="8708995">And I would not only point out that we question but while we did not brief in this case the issue of the propriety of the level of the in-line price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.204" offset="8792168">The reason we didn't do it is at least in my view, I thought that question not to be comprised within the questions upon which this Court had granted certiorari and it was for that reason that we didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.652" offset="8849951">Now I did point out in my brief that the resolution of the proper level of the in-line price which the court below did not consider although the issue has hardly contested there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.487" offset="8925288">It involves a considerable number of both questions of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.579" offset="8957680">Now going back to the -- shall we say creator of the so-called suspect price doctrine and that is the Ninth Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.807" offset="9002611">It will be recalled that at the time of that proceeding which was shall we say, shortly after the CATCO situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.238" offset="9040332">There were any number of cases then pending on appeal, as a matter of fact, the Ninth Circuit other than the Third Circuit which had been summarily are reversed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.822" offset="9090696">I believe was the first of all of the Court of Appeals courts to consider the remanded 19 -- of the 1959 series of orders by the Commission which are the basis originally of this current procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.825" offset="9166660">And there they said in response to a contention made by one of the petitioners here, United Gas Improvement Company that certainly the Commission in trying to determine what the line of price is or not to consider as fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.983" offset="9243355">These prices which to say is certificated and which were presently before they said, court or judicial -- I mean, Commission or judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.240" offset="9280345">Now the reason for that statement was, a good many were then pending before the Courts of Appeals and the Third Circuit case,the Transco-Seaboard case is the generic term of it, had already been remanded back to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.823" offset="9334680">So they were pending there both before the Commission and the courts on review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.400" offset="9356936">And it said, certainly, those case -- those prices are subject to modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.030" offset="9371460">So you're not -- they're unreliable for any purpose of determining a price line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.790" offset="9386506">Then they went further and said, "And therefore, prices of similar nature, of similar amount is what they said really, which are subject to the same infirmities are under a cloud and ought not to be relied upon unless you can show it in that subject to the same infirmities", as my colleague has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.479" offset="9473337">The only infirmity of CATCO was insufficiency of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.413" offset="9492982">If you have a final, non-reviewable order then of course the question of whether or not the Commission did or did not properly on the record have evidence before it becomes immaterial just cannot attack those orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.593" offset="9565706">They're valid on their face and not subject to collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.066" offset="9579604">Now there was one further point and I think this is most important in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.306" offset="9608547">There were a number of cases in one of which I happen to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.972" offset="9635297">In which either the United Gas Improvement Company or the Public Service Commission of the State of New York had sought to intervene, had been denied intervention by the Commission had taken the issue of their right if any to intervene to the courts and had been -- and there, the Commission had been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.872" offset="9726830">As a matter of fact, there were two separate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.810" offset="9738637">In one, the New York Public Service Commission was denied the right to intervene because it has waited too long and was a procedural effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.496" offset="9781373">In the other, they were permitted too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.475" offset="9789315">But now, that proceeding involved a hotly contested original certificate matter involving all the trunk line sales not all but involving the trunk line sales and I would say -- I hesitate (Inaudible) -- hazard I guess but about 20 separate document -- dockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.758" offset="9878444">Now, all of those cases had been certificated by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.286" offset="9896521">They were final and they were on appeal but as a matter of fact they were appealed without success.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.075" offset="9919718">As to those, UGI said, we've been denied the right to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.091" offset="9935705">We couldn't go in and show how bad we thought those prices were so you ought not to consider them for the price line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.950" offset="9959215">The Ninth Circuit Court said without equivocation that it doesn't make any difference what you did, whether you tried to get in and were denied or whether you didn't even try to get in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.524" offset="9997458">If those cases are now unappealable, when we look in -- at a price line, not cost, not anything just, a price, group of prices and then those prices have to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.519" offset="10049494">Now -- so to that extent, we certainly do deny or take issue with the suspect price doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.022" offset="10083453">I didn't as I -- I don't know what to comment on this or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.386" offset="10096933">I didn't bring the other issue on this in-line price but that is the tax imbursement feature which again the Ninth Circuit held was a part of the initial price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.387" offset="10156910">The Commission determined here a price of 18.5 cents and they said that's the in-line price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.456" offset="10181151">Incidentally, that's the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.962" offset="10187212">It was in-line in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.636" offset="10197870">It was in-line in 1956, and they've now found that it's in-line in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.167" offset="10228067">They found only because in the remanded CATCO decision that they had used a 1.5 cent tax reimbursement for the information if necessary to the Court, the tax in Louisiana onshore where the state has jurisdiction is 2.3 cents per thousand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.437" offset="10329109">Almost all of the purchased contracts or sales contracts by the producers provide for some percentage of reimbursement of that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.807" offset="10382608">And so, what we're talking about is a percentage of the 2.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.118" offset="10403819">Now -- and I would call the Court's attention to the situation in this case involving Superior's United Gas contract and that contract is shown in the record in full at page 153.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.883" offset="10538924">That particular contract happens to provide for 100% of the then existing 2.3 cent tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.727" offset="10578317">Now, there is absolutely no and I do repeat no evidence in this record that will justify the finding of 1.5 cents tax reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.206" offset="10640175">The only evidence in the record is to the effect that if you look at all of the contracts of comparable period, the tax reimbursement was subject to error, it's shown upon Exhibit 6, I think it was 1.72.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.231" offset="10728260">If you looked at the contracts with current dates and the same type of prices, 21.5 cents, 21.4 cents base price and 57 and 58.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.533" offset="10789491">The average of those prices, the tax reimbursement provided was 2.1 cent, 2.01.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.008" offset="10819375">So, we do in fact take considerable issue with that matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.548" offset="10857514">Well, I think this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.939" offset="10891160">If you're looking at a price line, if that's the basis of this thing then you've got to determine and I sincerely suggest that no -- many courts have had difficulty in determining just exactly what this Court meant when it said an out of line price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.461" offset="10985200">And the reason I think that someone -- certainly they're -- is because they don't know what prices are to be considered for determining what the line is other than what I said about the Ninth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.917" offset="11039013">Now Mr. Justice Clark, I'd say that if you're going to fix a price on the basis of nothing but line of price, the tax reimbursement has to be either what my contract provides for or it has to be what the range of prices I suppose on the in-line approach would justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.024" offset="11131486">Now that range as I say, no matter how you look at it in this case is going to be an excess of 1.5.</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.221" offset="11248306">But I might tell you that is truly the -- that's the -- that represents the Section 7 hearing now accorded by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.182" offset="11292087">That's just about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.436" offset="11297102">We take all the prices, we add them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.309" offset="11304626">Now, I think that it's the Commission brief that says that the in-line price is the highest price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.235" offset="11336286">I would certainly like to challenge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.614" offset="11349870">In CATCO on remand, the Commission went to considerable length to point out that the in-line price is not the highest price or not the highest group of prices but something -- a price that which substantial quantities of moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.062" offset="11415594">I can't believe that that was what this Court meant when it was talking about in CATCO, a price 25% higher than Tennessee Gas had ever paid for any gas anywhere, 4.4 cents more than Tennessee had paid for the West Delta Gas, I believe it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.942" offset="11495111">A price that was 70% higher than Tennessee Gas then weighted average cost of purchased gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.666" offset="11530010">And they've said this is out of line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.421" offset="11537011">Well, I think I would be the first to concede it was out of line and yet it had been certificated without condition by the Commission on a record which in the words of this Court showed little more than the printed contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.037" offset="11599496">Now under those circumstances, of course the Court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify this rate, 25% higher than anybody else ever paid as being required by the public interest and therefore, you remanded the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.272" offset="11676505">Now, I would like to get over the fact that at least in my view and I think it was out of the court below, the entirety of the in-line approach violates the general purpose of the Natural Gas Act as this Court has declared that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.295" offset="11784547">That is to provide natural gas at the lowest, possible, reasonable rate consistent with the maintenance of adequate service in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.365" offset="11836792">Now, why did I say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.080" offset="11843688">First, because as I've mentioned before, when you look at the price line, you don't look at how those prices got there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.545" offset="11869602">You don't look at how they got certificated if you're going to take the certification as a qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.292" offset="11904502">You just say they are there so now look at the prices and then the Commission says, “But we're not going to look at any prices higher than the CATCO 18.5 cent price because anything else has been affected, tainted, infected or in some manner influenced and of course, the Commission said, we have no doubt of that and yet the record in this case I submit, shows just exactly to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.913" offset="12010977">Dr. Foster said, “That wasn't the situation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.367" offset="12024874">He said that price has hadn't even gone from plateau to plateau.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.697" offset="12038144">He pointed out that from 1940 -- I think he used 1947 and 1949 as an average, that using that average enough to 1960, the price of gas, the highest price had gone up 22% during which period of time, the cost of drilling for new gas supply had gone up 52% in the same area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.793" offset="12154546">That is why when you get to price line and you realize that those prices were not based upon cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.125" offset="12195924">They don't represent just and reasonable prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.615" offset="12205850">They are prices which happen to have been certificated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.207" offset="12220165">And getting back for a moment to this matter of infirmity, if the infirmity there has to do with the Commission's approach in certificating these prices, I respectfully submit every certificated price in the United States is subject to infirmity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.880" offset="12302921">Not one has been based upon anything other than this is the price the parties agreed upon and it looks to us like it must be alright and it's in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.439" offset="12349106">Now, what did they do as my colleague pointed out?</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.094" offset="12359764">In the CATCO situation they said, “If this price is like any price that's previously been paid then it's alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.660" offset="12398007">And this Court reversed them, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.750" offset="12406366">They say, “You can't just ignore the issue of price in the public convenience.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.391" offset="12432906">You came -- just look at the maintenance of adequate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.393" offset="12452968">Now, what are they doing now?</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.550" offset="12457566">They have turned the situation exactly backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.495" offset="12469373">Now, they disregard the maintenance of adequate service and looked only to price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.077" offset="12511692">I think my colleague said that he believes that they should have taken a middle ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.869" offset="12538859">I think, maybe in the same principle but a little different expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.024" offset="12567489">They should have followed what this Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.571" offset="12573654">They should have evaluated all of the factors of public convenience and those are the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.946" offset="12603120">In other words, what is the price proposed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.233" offset="12620257">Is this required?</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.010" offset="12627362">Now in that light, I would like to call to the Court's mind its own Hunt conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.171" offset="12660067">That case involved temporary certification and we don't here have that same problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.066" offset="12691623">But significantly, in considering the certificating power and conditioning power of the Commission under Section 7, the Court referred to the 1942 amendment of Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.541" offset="12761527">The Court there pointed out that the very purpose of this 1942 Amendment was to permit the Commission to -- shall I use the words of the Court in CATCO, carefully scrutinize and evaluate the financial set up, the adequacy of gas reserves, the feasibility and adequacy of the proposed service, and the characteristic -- the financial characteristic -- no, the characteristic of the rate structure of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.995" offset="12899349">They said and I think also they took these words from the -- from Congress that these were vital matters to certification, vital matters that ought to be considered by the Commission at the time of certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.337" offset="12984717">I respectfully submit that looking only to pass certificated prices, not a single one of those vital matters is even touched upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="3574.573" offset="14401703">We had a totally unconditioned except the way they accept it or reject it (Inaudible) -- the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.405" offset="14437021">We had to accept or reject and under the contract, we couldn't very well reject because it was satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.356" offset="14476831">And under the order, we had to do something before the time for judicial review; petition for judicial review would even expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.869" offset="14510895">Now over and above these contract situations, I think the Court is well aware that in the oil and gas industry you cannot for too long fail to sell gas if you've got -- if you have gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.320" offset="14584665">In other words, as in oil and gas, let's say you have an obligation to market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.649" offset="14605981">That obligation has to be carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.483" offset="14617266">Now you in many cases have some relief on you at least where there is no available market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.766" offset="14646418">But I've never seen the issue tried where I've been very hesitant of the outcome from the oil company's point of view, if you have the market and say, “No, I just want to take it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.390" offset="14692916">Now, it's been argued by counsel on the other side that by commencing this service, we took the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.823" offset="14734712">I don't think we took any risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.780" offset="14742444">We took action we were legally entitled to take as the Commission's general counsel recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.324" offset="14768671">We took actions which the respondents -- I mean, excuse me, the petitioners could have stopped and they so stays and they didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.958" offset="14811199">But over it, over and above that, if you assume that we have some risk, we surely didn't take the risk of confiscation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.370" offset="14856861">And confiscation is exactly what we've been vested with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.375" offset="14876923">Now, the evidence here was all rejected I concede but not the same token by that very rejection that evidence must be taken as proof what it purports to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.650" offset="14937945">It has not been cross-examined, I concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.480" offset="14953305">But nevertheless, if the evidence I tend now is to be rejected, then it must be because the parties concede that it doesn't make any difference how good it is, how weighed it is, how well prepared it is, it's still irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.057" offset="15031568">And that is a matter of fact is exactly what the Commission held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.588" offset="15049749">Now, I believe counsel for UGI in his “narrow ground” for reversing the court below said that this evidence weren't prepared exactly in the Commission format.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.536" offset="15121533">I respectfully call the Court's attention to the decision on the court below saying that it was in fact and that evidence showed that the unit cost of these respondents exceeded their contract prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.812" offset="15186631">And yet, the Commission is reducing those contract prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.726" offset="15206275">Now, mind you, I'm well aware of the fact that if I contract for less of my cost and I might assure you that all of these contracts were made, negotiated and bargained for without any knowledge of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.864" offset="15262804">We just didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.122" offset="15271894">As a matter of fact, we didn't care, and why, because we had to take what we could get at the market at the hands of the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.088" offset="15311705">We couldn't get any more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.230" offset="15324244">And we took these prices as we had taken much lower prices earlier because again, that's all we could get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.270" offset="15360502">It doesn't make any difference what the in-line price is, what the guideline price is, what any price is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.319" offset="15388609">The producer of gas will never in this world get more than the pipeline fields that the market requires and that's the reason going back to Hunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.018" offset="15439496">Your first item mentioned there was, adequacy of gas reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.299" offset="15468544">No pipeline is going to buy my gas at 25 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.160" offset="15484008">If they can buy my neighbor's gas at 23 cents, 22 cents, 21 cents or any lesser figure than I'm willing to sell it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.448" offset="15521207">Your Honors, I see I've had my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3867.703" offset="15574183">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.865" offset="15590797">I would like at this moment right at the outset to answer a question near and dear to my heart which I believe Mr. Justice Clark asked of Mr. Varner some time back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.224" offset="15636250">That was whether the producer or any of these producers here had filed for their 23.55 or for some higher price following certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.284" offset="15692466">And wouldn't we be able to protect ourselves on that basis in the unique circumstance of this case Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.449" offset="15721200">We could not protect ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.302" offset="15728619">Let us assume that the Commission had done the right thing to begin with and we have been certificated we'll say at 20 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.072" offset="15755682">We could then have filed up to 23.55 cents and have been collecting that for the past, however, many years it's been subject to refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.529" offset="15793507">Now, petitioners take the position that because we did not have a permanent certificate, we are entitled only to an in-line price and we're not entitled to a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.203" offset="15832168">And certainly, most of all, we're not entitled to any determination of the justness and reasonableness of the price we've been collecting for the last eight or nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.861" offset="15866859">Now, the practical effect of requiring refunds as the Commission would where the measure is the in-line price rather than the just and reasonable rate would be almost absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.646" offset="15909909">It would be almost too horrible to think about from some of these producers point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.830" offset="15930702">We would have to refund immediately, moneys collected back to January 1, 1962 in the case of my client Callery of 1959 I'm sorry, refunded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.106" offset="15983783">And then we're told to file for 23.55 and began to collect all over again subject to refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.176" offset="16012100">Suppose Your Honors that down the line at the conclusion of the Southern Louisiana area rate proceeding, it is determined that the price is a penny or a half cent higher than 18.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.859" offset="16074794">How is the Commission at that point ever or going to make Callery whole or how can Callery be ever made whole?</text>

            <text syncTime="4066.275" offset="16368515">Now I've -- by attempting to answer your question which was put to Mr. Varner, I've gotten completely off the track of my argument and I would like if I might to return because I'm going to get back to this, I assure you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.048" offset="16407594">This is the near and dear things to the heart of my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.450" offset="16421177">But I would like to address myself very briefly to the moratorium issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.277" offset="16440508">In Hunt last term, in your opinion Justice Clark, you held that it was at the point, a permanent certification or unconditional temporary certification that Section 4 came into play on the scheme of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.331" offset="16500694">It was at that point that the producer might go forward and avail himself of the rights reserved to natural gas companies under the Act to seek contractually authorized increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.310" offset="16544580">Now to be sure, the question of the Commission's authority to condition a grant of permanent certification upon such a condition to impose such a moratorium was not touched, was not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.072" offset="16607692">We believe the court below was perfectly correct in holding that the moratorium imposed in this case as a condition of permanent authorization aggravated perhaps by the facts that we've given our right to reject it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.881" offset="16658892">We never have that on this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.578" offset="16665684">But if that exceeded the Commission statutory authority, all we have is tantamount to write in Section 4 out of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.144" offset="16691911">Now, his reasoning and most persuasive to me and about the only thing that I can come up with is the rather extreme example I realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.814" offset="16734647">But if the Commission has the authority to impose a moratorium for whatever duration, as a condition of permanent certification, what are we doing here?</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.296" offset="16784593">The Commission might as well declare a permanent moratorium, the time of permanent certification on a finding made under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act that the present and future public convenience necessity requires that this particular gas reserve are all gas reserves to be sold at the same price and one price only for the 20-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.705" offset="16862229">And then to provide under Section 5 in an area rate proceeding we will give relief to the entire producing industry on a group basis rather than any individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.274" offset="16908518">I don't think that Congress ever intended that a -- an agency should have such unfettered power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.733" offset="16938297">They might as well write 19 out of the Act you know on the theory that their hard work, general counsel staff has got to have a little respite of a couple of years with no lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.777" offset="16978526">If they're going to write Section 4 out, why not 19, why not any other section?</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.958" offset="16991169">Now that may sound fictitious but a little absurd but as a practical matter at some point, you become a natural gas company and entitled to all the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.843" offset="17022725">You start with all the obligations and duties but at some point the right is attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.843" offset="17038712">Now, the extent of the Commission's power to condition permanent certification, in this case, we not only do we think it's another step for the scheme of the Act but there is no practical reason for it and as a matter of fact in my view and the view of my client, there's a very good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.659" offset="19790033">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.984" offset="19789928">We've got to preserve this right of the producer to at least seek, collect subject to refund his contractually authorized price until it is determined what the just and reasonable rate is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.938" offset="19789824">Now, the real problem is that I come right down to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.141" offset="19789720">The producer apparently, is never going to be able to justify his individual price because we're now going in the area of pricing and at the risk of giving a sneak preview of something that is not before the Court, I appreciate that but it's important to demonstrate why at least we must preserve some status quo here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.882" offset="19789615">In my view, there's a very serious question as to the validity of the area approach as it is now been applied in the Permian Basin decision, Opinion 468.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.968" offset="19789511">That will be the prototype for the Southern Louisiana proceeding certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.457" offset="19789406">They both use the same test here, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.044" offset="19789302">Now, in a nutshell, what the Commission has done is to start with an acceptance of the thesis of directionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.086" offset="19789197">This means in short that the producing industry today as a result of advancements in technology and experience gained over these many years can direct its search for -- you have oil or gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.236" offset="19789093">And bear in mind, this doesn't mean it's going to find it but if it find something, it's more likely to be oil and more likely to be gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.796" offset="19788988">People know where to look today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.840" offset="19788884">Now, this isn't restricted entirely to the majors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.894" offset="19788779">Some of us small producers can do it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.728" offset="19788675">The records are simply there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.696" offset="19788570">Alright now, in order to provide the incentive to the producer to go out and find gas, we have a two-price system cost based, the base is being the cost of finding new non-associative so-called gas-well gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.345" offset="19788466">Now that should be a premium fuel, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.947" offset="19788361">The producing industry should be encouraged to go out and find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.132" offset="19788257">Therefore, we will cut your old price and raise this new price for which you find in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.834" offset="19788152">The only problem for the small producer is that what is he -- the where -- whether they find this new thing is dependent on his past revenues and income.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.071" offset="19788048">But beside that in terms of doubtful validity, in the Permian case, unfortunately, the Commission admittedly made no effort to determine whether the industry will recover, the industry determined cost at the price fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.214" offset="19787943">They don't know what the impact of this thing is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.879" offset="19787839">By their own admission at least half of the producers will not earn the rate of return which the Commission is determined to be just and reasonable for the industry as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.452" offset="19787734">This is a problem you run into in any -- anytime you go into averages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.145" offset="19787630">They fix the price of new gas-well gas based on the cost associated with 20% for the production in the whole Permian Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.270" offset="19787525">They ignore the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.412" offset="19787421">Its too fragmentary, can't get a hold of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.551" offset="19787316">Now, they have a savings clause, you will recall that in the second Philip's case, there was an argument -- in the course of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.266" offset="19787212">The Commission indicated, Mr. Solomon indicated that in all probability, the Commission would have to make some provision for the individual who just couldn't live under this savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.323" offset="19787107">The savings clause has emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.873" offset="19787003">It is at least from my standpoint and I know many others, bankruptcy standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.841" offset="19786898">The only way that you can get on variation apparently will be to show that you're not recovering out of pocket operating expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.208" offset="19786794">Forget any return, forget any profit in effect you're bankrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.063" offset="19786689">At which case, the Commission says, "I'll be -- maybe entitled some relief from refunds or permitted to abandon yourself because if you're not tough shape, you probably don't have much gas to sell anyhow".</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.395" offset="19786585">Well if the small producer who finds himself in that position is indeed socially or economically undesirable, so be it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.482" offset="19786480">However, the important thing for the Court I think to keep in mind is when we look at the question of the refund and the standard utilized by the court below, that is of the just and reasonable rate that even the Commission under an area approach where we fix it on averages and don't look at the individual does recognize it in the matter of refund, it runs perhaps smacked dead into the constitutional issue of confiscation unless it does look at the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.559" offset="19786376">So it has a savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.043" offset="19786271">I assure you gentlemen, the savings clause will be tested by somebody if he hasn't, he might pay his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.166" offset="19786167">But we do have several serious questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.820" offset="19786062">Now in the interim -- oh, I forgot to mention the most important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.542" offset="19785958">I'm talking about moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.603" offset="19785853">The Commission has now enclosed another moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.346" offset="19785749">Having now determined the just and reasonable area rate, it says, there shall be no rate increases above the ceiling prices fixed for a period of about two and a half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.928" offset="19785644">This sole statutory basis -- there's no statutory basis for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.308" offset="19785540">The sole basis is that otherwise we'd have to start another area case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.713" offset="19785435">Now bearing in mind that the whole determination in that case and in the Southern Louisiana case which is our case will be on the basis of 1960 data.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.104" offset="19785331">That opinion will not come to Your Honors for another two years probably and then we've got until 1968 before we can even begin to file for and collect subject to refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.114" offset="19785226">How in the world is the Commission ever going to come out with a decision that isn't so stale, and ancient and hoary by the time we get it but its not indicative of the current need of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.772" offset="19785122">Now our position on this in-line question is that the one place where the Commission does have an opportunity to respond and react is when the new proposal comes before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.113" offset="19785017">At that time, it can evaluate if the price appears to be out of line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.007" offset="19784913">It can give the producer an opportunity to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.233" offset="19784808">Perhaps if this line has moved and we don't have to wait for an area proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.917" offset="19784704">But as of today, there are some types of evidence the Commission could prescribe as being relevant to show them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.454" offset="19784600">We don't attack CATCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.140" offset="19784495">We don't attack in-line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.672" offset="19784391">We simply say that we -- in this case, without knowing what to show, try to show too much perhaps but if it's more relevant to a rate case, and Mr. Varner is correct, we can't put in a rate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.896" offset="19784286">They won't look at this individually just in groups and numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.200" offset="19784182">Where are we going to put them?</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.284" offset="19784077">Where are we going to have our day?</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.953" offset="19783973">Is it when we get to the savings clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.230" offset="19783868">Or just two points, if one of them is in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.509" offset="19783764">Within the last ten days, the staff in the Southern Louisiana proceeding which supposedly will be determined of a large just and reasonable rate for the future as applying the Permian Basin costing principles come up with the finding that Callery's cost, production cost, exploration and development cost with the 12% rate of return, no taxes or anything in 1960 was 21.96 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.586" offset="19783659">The in-line price they've prescribed is 18.5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.767" offset="19783555">We're collecting 23.55.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.010" offset="19783450">They would have as immediately refund the difference between 23.55 and 18.5 and let's assume that price turns out to be 21 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.611" offset="19783346">How can they ever get the difference between 18.5 and the 21?</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.113" offset="19783241">We can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.612" offset="19783137">The Commission is the first to tell you and they're quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.385" offset="19783032">They have no reparations power, no power to go back and to hope unless we are permitted to retain this subject to refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.092" offset="19782928">As a matter of fact, more refund than the producer of a consumer we'd get otherwise, because of the -- he's going to get five or six months more refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.364" offset="19782823">The suspension period they speak of, unless we do where -- we're in an impossible situation out of -- to relate this refund problem and the moratorium problem to Callery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.338" offset="19782719">My client, Callery is a small independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.989" offset="19782614">Not too small.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.360" offset="19782510">In 1963, in the Commission's published statistics of sales by independent producers, there were shown 260 producers selling over two billion cubic feet of gas a year in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.139" offset="19782405">Callery's at number 140 out of 260.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.355" offset="19782301">That was in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.320" offset="19782196">Callery is dependent for all of its income which goes into exploring or in finding gas on the investment from individuals, more than 300 of them who come in and put their money and they're carefully screened because they can lose it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.490" offset="19782092">They can afford to lose it perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.667" offset="19781987">They come in, they participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.194" offset="19781883">Callery has to provide the expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.341" offset="19781778">The well production is found, they all own a percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.616" offset="19781674">Now these investors partly because of the depressing state of the domestic oil at the present time and also because of the very existence of Federal Power Commission regulation and the difficulties we have with it, such things as a refund without warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.710" offset="19781569">These investors have become less and less enchanted with the prospect of putting their money into this and they want to go elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.282" offset="19781465">As a result, Callery in the last two years, their E&amp;D, exploration and development, their looking program has gone way down and will continue to go down probably until some stability comes here or until at least there's a recognition that as a public utility if you will or a natural gas company under the Act much as a pipeline, we are entitled to a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.658" offset="19781360">That doesn't have to be determined at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.066" offset="19781256">We go in to business, we realize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.004" offset="19781151">But at some point, they've got to look at us individually, otherwise like Justice Clark predicted, maybe the consumer will be the biggest use of this wild goose chase but a small producer is going to be the dead duck.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.834" offset="19781047">Just two other matters Your Honors, if I may, first, Callery also raised the question of justness and reasonableness and the failure to make such a determination before ordering refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.303" offset="19780942">It raised that before the Commission and its application for rehearing and it was argued in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.962" offset="19780838">On the question of refunds and the Court's legitimate concern and that of the Commission that you can't deter these things rather, that is at best a poor remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.822" offset="19780733">Certainly, just and reasonable rates are a better remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.468" offset="19780629">I would point out Your Honor that there was evidence in the record in this case, indicating and which should have indicated that there was serious question as to just what the amount of any increase that has occurred over these years was and whether it has in fact been passed on to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.331" offset="19780524">Now, just as past week, well, not quite, October 4th, the Commission has suddenly waken up to the fact that it was -- should've been aware of some time that Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation is asserting the right to retain $8 million of refund from producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.947" offset="19795153">Texas Eastern says, “We never passed on the increase from the producers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.996" offset="19815320">Now, some of these distributing companies for instance the United Gas Improvement Company didn't increase its rates in the period of 1950 to 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.286" offset="19856488">During this period of jumping, leaping, bolting prices, it increased its rates once.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.447" offset="19881148">1.4 - 2% to recover an increase on the gross receipts tax in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.038" offset="19903509">It has since filed an increase based on the fact that they set up a depreciation accounting situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.314" offset="19924616">Now, they undoubtedly will refund through anything that they pass -- passed on or that they have collected from the consumer when it comes back if there is anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.416" offset="19965053">They will do it and the Commission seeking to -- see that they do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.767" offset="19974457">I only mention this to establish the fact that there is some question as to what the impact on the consumer has been and before the producer -- after all, the Natural Gas Act was for the consumer is not to protect or for the benefit of distributing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.240" offset="20044361">Before we are made to refund, should we not have to determine whether our price is just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.853" offset="20066826">We are Natural Gas Company just as applied by Mr. Justice Brennan stated in summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.294" offset="20088560">I don't believe I have anything else Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="5159.987" offset="20743293">Alright, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.259" offset="20760430">The proper measure of refunds is a very important question in this case although petitioners did not really meet this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.818" offset="20810689">The Commission merely points out that the producers assume the risk by commencing deliveries of gas before the certificates became final that is before while they were still subject to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.906" offset="20870980">The New York Commission contends that restitution must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.015" offset="20887385">Now assuming this, it still doesn't offer any aid as to the proper measure of making refunds and regardless of how the Court disposes of the other issues in this case, the questions with respect to the refunds that the Commission has ordered us to make covering the past seven years now should be determined on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.021" offset="21007444">The question is can the Commission require producers to refund a portion of a rate that is below a just and reasonable level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.394" offset="21056972">We think not as this Court said in United Gas Pipeline Company versus Memphis Light Gas and Water Division, 358 U.S. 103 at page 113.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.191" offset="21108172">Business reality demands that natural gas companies should not be precluded by law from increasing the price of their product whenever -- that is the economically necessary means of keeping the intake and outgo of their revenues and proper balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.307" offset="21192600">Now, we submit at this same principle applies after the money has been collected and that none of it need be refunded if it is necessary to balance the outgo and we're not here questioning the authority of the Commission to order refunds but rather the measure by which the re -- the refunds are to be determined and if so -- to be determined and whether they are -- whether any refunds are due and if so, the proper amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.599" offset="21341811">It must be remembered that at the time the Commission issued its order requiring refunds that the producers had been delivering gas for five years since January 1959 and since that time, two additional years have passed so we are talking about the refund over a seven year period between the contract wise of 23.55 cents and the 20 cents which includes tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.966" offset="21471274">It is true that the producers commence deliveries before the certificates became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.547" offset="21505546">But it's also true that no producer and I think, I'd be safe saying no other party thought that, anyone would ever be required to refund prices or money collected below a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.774" offset="21586422">We just felt that we can rely upon the statute and the Constitution to retain a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.054" offset="21627591">The certificates were overturned as has been said and on remand, the Commission determined the rate including tax to be 20 cents per Mcf. that's the in-line rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.884" offset="21678895">And as a condition to the reissuance of these certificates, they required the producers to refund all of the money collected above the 20 cent level since first deliveries, January 1959 to date even though that 20 cent in-line price had not been shown to be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.439" offset="21793102">Now in doing this, the Commission excluded evidence that was offered to demonstrate that the contract rates were just and reasonable and that the in-line rate was confiscatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.845" offset="21858722">The lower court ruled that refunds could only be made to the extent that they exceeded a just and reasonable level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.726" offset="21906265">The full import of this lower court's ruling is simply to require that the rates for the period prior to the in-line determination be just and reasonable and the rates for the period after the in-line determination be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.555" offset="21973556">And after all, that is the ultimate goal of the Act is to have just and reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.819" offset="22002604">We support the lower court's ruling and urge Your Honor to affirm it for four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.410" offset="22033011">First and perhaps the most important one, it's fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.330" offset="22048684">It's fair to the consumer, it's fair to the producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.290" offset="22064567">Commissioner O'Connor dissented from the Commission decision on this refund question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.636" offset="22089958">He said that equitable considerations compel the Commission to allow the producers to file increases retroactively if the rate was going to be reduced retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.030" offset="22167489">He also pointed out that the Commission staff as well as the United Gas Improvement Company seemed to sense that if turning the clock back, it saw us where the consumer (Inaudible), it is equally good gravy for the producer (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.048" offset="22239587">Now, the lower court found that the only way of balancing the consumer and the producer needs was by requiring a just and reasonable determination before requiring refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.047" offset="22295594">Now it's stated that could be in a proper proceeding not necessarily Section 7 but some proceeding before requiring refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.077" offset="22331643">Now each of the petitioners in arguing in support of the evidentiary issue yesterday, stress the fact that the producers have the right upon -- putting into an effect the in-line price, the 20 cent price including tax to immediately file an increase in rate back up to the initial contract rate level, 23.55 and to collect that rate subject to refund pending a just and reasonable determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.674" offset="22478033">Now, had the Commission fix this in-line rate of 20 cents in the original certificates in 1958 and 1959 and allowed the producers to at that time increase the rate from the 20 cents up to the 23.55 and collect it subject to refund, the result would be no different than what the lower court ruling requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.546" offset="22605511">The second reason for affirming the lower court on this issue is that by using the just and reasonable standard to determine refunds, the purpose of the Act will be fulfilled which as this Court stated in CATCO is to afford consumers a complete, permanent and effective bond of protection from excessive rates and charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5660.848" offset="22746781">Now, the in-line price will not afford the consumer this same protection because as Mr. Solomon stated yesterday, sometimes the in-line price will be higher than the just and reasonable price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.349" offset="22804773">Where that's the case, the consumer will be paying the higher price until a just and reasonable determination and at that time, you'll have no means of recouping the overcharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.343" offset="22868720">Now petitioners talk about overcharges, excessive rates and windfall and runaway prices but they don't explain how a just and reasonable rate can be excessive nor can they because Congress declared that any rate that is not just and reasonable is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.080" offset="22963702">Now clearly, Congress didn't intend for the Commission to force the producers to sell gas at prices below just and reasonable levels for a seven or eight-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5727.617" offset="23013857">The third reason for affirming the lower court is that it provides for the only reasonable measure of refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.819" offset="23058683">Section 7 (e) only gives the Commission authority to attach such reasonable conditions as the public interest and necessity may require and certainly, a condition calling for refunds below a just and reasonable level could not be termed reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="7326.963" offset="29411244">There were some questions earlier in the argument about the evidentiary basis, to the extent to which the triggering moratorium got into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7338.220" offset="29456280">And I think I can make that fairly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="7342.672" offset="29474043">During the course of the hearings in this proceeding, the staff of the Commission and I think one of the intervenors as well, argued that a special separate triggering condition should be included with respect to certain sales that are being made to Transco.</text>
            <text syncTime="7359.120" offset="29539871">I don't even remember who they're being made by.</text>
            <text syncTime="7361.900" offset="29550947">But this argument that a special triggering condition could be made on some of these sales but not others was rejected by the examiner and subsequently by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7373.530" offset="29597445">It found as a matter of fact that although this triggering might have occurred at an earlier stage, this was unfortunately water over the dam that you couldn't undo it with the condition and they refused this special condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7387.248" offset="29652407">But they did go ahead in their decision and this is at page 578 of the record to explain why they were putting in the general limited moratorium that I've mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7403.152" offset="29715937">Now the evidence, the basis for the 23.55 cents was not something that had been litigated at an earlier stage in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="7418.083" offset="29775705">The 23.5 moratorium price level as the Commission makes clear on page 578 was based upon official notice of the Commission at that time took of the various rate schedules involving the pipelines whose sales were involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7440.584" offset="29865671">This is something pursuant to both Act, an obvious equity which could have been challenged as a factual matter by any of these parties on rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7452.020" offset="29911437">And as we point out in our brief, in a subsequent case, not this one, one of these parties or one of their affiliates did challenge this very same 23.55 level when it was applied in the subsequent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7467.385" offset="29972877">And in that case, the Commission went on and explained as a matter of fact why he'd adopted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7473.045" offset="29995551">But in this particular case, nobody challenged the 23.55 cent level as a triggering level.</text>
            <text syncTime="7480.963" offset="30027212">They all challenged our legal right under the Hunt case and under the legal doctrines to insert any moratorium and ODECO did say that there was no evidence in the record supporting this thing but nobody challenged the basis, the official notice basis of the Commission that 23.55 cents was in fact a level which was likely to cause triggering and that's why we say that the question of this level is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7518.710" offset="30178200">Now, as to the refund matter, I think it was Justice Brennan or Justice Clark that was raising the question of whether this wasn't at least divisible as of the time of the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7530.974" offset="30227310">And as to that matter, I think Mr. Hicks inadvertently misstated what happened because he suggested that this matter was not divisible that they either have to accept everything or nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7546.938" offset="30291153">This isn't quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="7548.615" offset="30297840">When the Commission issued its initial decision there are requests made for stay of everything by these various parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7557.724" offset="30334307">But the Commission emulating my illustrious predecessor did split may be here and if you'll look at page 615 and 616 of the record, you'll see that the Commission at that time granted a stay itself as to past refunds which obviously couldn't be affected by what happened in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="7580.770" offset="30426467">But rejected a stay for the future and the problems if there are any that have been caused since this Commission decision with respect to refunds are entirely because these people then went ahead and persuaded the Fifth Circuit to grant them a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="7599.173" offset="30500028">So at least to that extent, Mr. Justice Brennan was quite right in saying that this matter was divisible.</text>
            <text syncTime="7606.149" offset="30527927">Actually, with respect to this refund matter, at least since 1960 and 61 when these cases were remanded by the various Courts of Appeals and in one case by this Court, all of these parties were well aware of the jeopardy they were in.</text>
            <text syncTime="7626.544" offset="30609533">And in January 1962, the Commission expressed order, said that they were going to be liable to refunds and express the standards that they're going to be liable to.</text>
            <text syncTime="7639.711" offset="30662196">So to the extent that there are equitable problems of the measure of refunds, what they should or should not be, I would think that if anything that exist only for this very early period while the case is on appeal to the court and as I've indicated in my brief --</text>

            <text syncTime="7755.171" offset="31124041">No, they only knew that the price they had was out of line and not going to be growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7761.774" offset="31150477">Finally, let me say a word about the in-line price itself and the evidence thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="7768.729" offset="31178271">There were some suggestion here that are dismissal of the rates of more than 18.5 cents as suspect in fact affected by CATCO was something we just did without any basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7789.161" offset="31259982">This isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="7792.974" offset="31275238">The examiner went into this matter at some length and he pointed out that there was testimony in the original dockets when they were getting these very high prices, in these very cases in which the main buyer of gas were Transco and made clear that the only reason he paid these prices which were way out of line which Transco had ever paid before was because of the effect of the CATCO decision which had been issued by the Commission briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="7821.842" offset="31390699">And it was on the basis of this type of evidence that both the examiner and the Commission itself found as a matter of fact that the higher prices here were not merely suspect but were in fact corrupted by the earlier CATCO prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="7843.515" offset="31477426">I don't think there's anything more I really have to say except if I may move from the epithet that Justice Clark used a little earlier when he said that our in-line price is a stop gap price.</text>
            <text syncTime="7859.792" offset="31542523">This is true but with one amendment which I think Justice Harlan referred to and that is, it's a stop gap price only in the sense that it's a -- the starting price and within triggering limitations, it is a price which people could escalate up to from.</text>
            <text syncTime="7876.971" offset="31611277">It is in other words we say the in-line price which we are setting, is the price which these people can charge without future refund obligations and anything they want to charge which they can charge under their contracts above that, they have to take the risk of further refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="7896.814" offset="31690585">Thank you.</text>
