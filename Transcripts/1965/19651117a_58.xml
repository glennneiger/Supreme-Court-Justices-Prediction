            <text syncTime="61.526" offset="349497">This case raises two important questions in the administration of the patent system, one substantive and one procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.741" offset="382307">The question on the merits is whether a patent may be obtained on a process whose only function is to produce a useless product.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.339" offset="428701">The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has held that such a process is patentable regardless of the total lack of utility of the sole product of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.413" offset="481050">That is the court has held that a process to produce, for example, garbage or sewage, which has no utility whatsoever, would be a valid patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.643" offset="537893">It's also held that a process could produce some material which just is an in dirt lump of material, you can't do anything, you don't know what to do with it would be a patentable process because produces a product.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.534" offset="649488">I was using garbage as a -- a generic term to things that have no use.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.185" offset="684074">To the extent, Mr. Justice Douglas, that you assume that everything is useful, then the issue in this case doesn't arise, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals assumed that the product of the this process was in fact useless and held that nevertheless the process to produce the product was a patentable useful process.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.987" offset="771323">Now, this apparently is true in, for example, the industry in which this case arises, the drug industry and chemical industry, compounds that produce constantly, which have no known utility and lots of them never have any utility.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.390" offset="980929">Therefore, you might say that any product for example ought to be patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.159" offset="1004022">That is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.504" offset="1009351">It is conceded in this case by the court below, conceded by the respondents that used things which are presently useless are not patentable regardless of the speculative fact that someday they may be useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.294" offset="1064521">That's clearly true as the products -- it's clearly true as to machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.763" offset="1070373">We see no reason to have a different view as to processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.146" offset="1083956">And Mr. Justice Stewart, the reason for that I think is that there's a lot of harm in giving patents on presently useless things because patents have a preclusive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.971" offset="1127215">You can use a patent if you get it to stop other people from finding the use.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.190" offset="1144142">Now, if you balance those things together, it seems as you clearly come out with the judgment that it ought to be not patentable, even though of course there's a possibility that it may be useful but you've got to balance that against the harm.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="273.441" offset="1197119">Your thought is that -- that in order to find out or to have any hope of someday ascertaining whether Product A is useful, you should not have a patent on them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="284.008" offset="1239437">Right, just on the hope that it may be useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.401" offset="1248946">You've got to show more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.528" offset="1253439">And that's been the clear -- that's been the clear course of decision in the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.929" offset="1271097">That's what the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals held in 1950 in words which couldn't be any more explicit, and it's only recently that they have -- that they have retreated from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.365" offset="1308818">Before reaching the merits, however, if I may, there is a jurisdictional question in this case, namely whether the court has jurisdiction on writ of certiorari to review decisions such as this one of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in patent and also in trademark cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.089" offset="1383737">This question was touched upon in this Court's decision three years ago in Glidden against Zdanok where the Court held that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is an Article III court exercising the judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.772" offset="1434415">In that case, however, the Court explicitly left open the precise question involved here that is whether 28 U.S.C. 1256, which is the relevant jurisdictional statute, does indeed confer jurisdiction on this Court to review patent or trademark cases in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="354.897" offset="1522918">Yes, Glidden disposed of the constitutional question, held the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to be an Article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.044" offset="1547577">The statute is unqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.578" offset="1553638">It's says all cases in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.290" offset="1564505">We believe that the statute 1256 does confer jurisdiction and that the Court, in fact, therefore, can resolve the issue on the merits in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.502" offset="1601390">I would like now, as I've said, to address myself to the jurisdictional question before coming to the -- to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.126" offset="1627826">So the purpose of doing this, I'd like to give some background in the way Patent Office decisions are reviewable because I think that's necessary to see the importance of the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.669" offset="1678085">When a patent is denied by the Patent Office, there are two methods of judicial review of that Patent Office denial, which are provided by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.297" offset="1720508">In the first place, there's what's a called a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.185" offset="1732106">It used to be called an action in equity against the Commission of Patents in the District Court for the District of Columbia, that's provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 145 in the Patent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.607" offset="1785814">The District Court's decision is of course reviewable by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.961" offset="1807235">The District Court's decision as I say called a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.578" offset="1817684">No one's ever had any doubt that that civil action is within the judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.620" offset="1833880">It is therefore reviewable by the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals' decision is in turn clearly reviewable and was always been recognized to be reviewable by this Court on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.601" offset="1873795">And as our brief points out, several of such decisions have been reviewed here without noticing any difficulty, and I think there's no question that that route of review, District Court civil action, Court of Appeals review of the District Court is reviewable here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.931" offset="1935130">The other mode of review is the one that's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.187" offset="1948087">If the patent's denied, instead of going to the District Court, you can take what's called an appeal to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.465" offset="1977240">That's provided by Sections 141 to 144 of the Patent Act and also 28 U.S.C. Section 1542.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.711" offset="2018200">These two routes are alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.622" offset="2029902">That is, each statute provides that if you take the other one, you can't use the one involved in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.734" offset="2054353">You can't go to the District Court if you've appealed to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and an appeal to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is clearly provided to constitute a waiver of the right to go to the District Court, that's in Section 141 of the Patent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.197" offset="2108165">Now, as I stated before, if you go to the District Court, there's no question that certiorari jurisdiction is in this Court to review the decision of the Court of Appeals' reviewing decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.433" offset="2165112">We urge that the same result should apply if the route you take is through the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.692" offset="2194160">Now, that that court has been clearly recognized to be a court exercising the judicial power just like the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.727" offset="2234284">As I say, the statute, if that's all one looked to, is clear that that would lead you clearly to that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.927" offset="2263124">It provides that cases in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.559" offset="2293635">In addition, any policy reason you can think of regarding the issue of jurisdiction here, it seem to us to favor review of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals on the same terms as review of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.720" offset="2354239">The two courts occupies, I think I've shown, very similar positions in the scheme of review of the Patent Office, and, as in fact happened in this case, conflicts of principle may arise between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.369" offset="2408887">You may have the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia adopting one rule as to patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.301" offset="2432606">For example, they have clearly accepted our position on the merits of this case and you may have the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals taking the opposite position.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.626" offset="2469909">In that circumstance, it seems to us, that all the policies of the judicial code in the certiorari jurisdiction clearly favor giving this Court the ability to resolve that conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.351" offset="2508779">Without it, you put the Patent Office in the terrible dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.296" offset="2520586">They've got one of the courts to which their decisions can be taken holding one thing, another court holding another.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.460" offset="2545246">The choice as to which route of review to take is in the patent applicant is unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.737" offset="2574294">I take it that would coerce the Patent Office to accept the rule, which is most favorable to the patent applicant because if they reject that rule, and accept the least favored one, they'll always be reviewed in the court that accepts the other rule, the more favorable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.587" offset="2637720">And if that court is the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals as it is in this case, there's no review here unless there is certiorari jurisdiction and the Patent Office, as I say, has put in clearly on untenable position.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.748" offset="2686412">Also, I think you can look to the term of the Patent Act here.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.232" offset="2704280">There is a great public interest in eliminating patents which are in fact invalid even before an infringement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.248" offset="2740328">It can always be even if the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals erroneously grants the patent, that issue can later be tested in an infringement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.895" offset="2774915">But what you have meanwhile is this patent which is in fact invalid in existence and it will obviously act to some discouragement to other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.911" offset="2806993">They may never want to raise the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.895" offset="2814934">So again, it seems to us that that policy, the policy of the Patent Act clearly militates in favor of giving this Court the power to review an erroneous decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.657" offset="2866030">One would expect that not too many occasions would arise when a decision of Court of Customs and Patent Appeals will properly invoke the certiorari jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.345" offset="2900720">It doesn't happen very often.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.800" offset="2906572">This case is quite rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.426" offset="2913050">But when -- with the consistency of the system, I should think would call for that jurisdiction's existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.661" offset="2938023">Now, as Mr. Justice Harlan's plurality opinion in the Glidden case points out however, despite the unqualified language of the section and despite what I think I've shown to be the clear policies of the judicial code favoring certiorari jurisdiction, the doubts do exist regarding where the Section 1256 should be read as written to confer jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.091" offset="3027780">And I take it that is what led the Court to put in the expressed disclaimer in Glidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.626" offset="3045857">But we have reexamined these doubts and we think that they don't stand in the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.995" offset="3063306">The doubts are entirely historical and they flow entirely from this Court's decision in the Postum Cereal Company case against the California Fig Nut Company in 272 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.121" offset="3111894">The case was decided in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.892" offset="3122970">At that time, this appeal jurisdiction, which is now on the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, was in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.703" offset="3162154">That is, if that time you could either go to the District Court for the civil action or you could go directly to the Court of Appeals on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.192" offset="3188172">The difference is you have a right to make something of a new record in the District Court, whereas in the Court of Appeals on the appeal, as now in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, you've got to use the record made before the Patent Office.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.857" offset="3282840">This -- the jurisdiction of the circuit court was transferred to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in 1929, two years after the Postum decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.408" offset="3317008">Now, in Postum, this Court held that it had, this Court, had no jurisdiction over the appeal's jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, because it deemed such decisions that is reviewing the Patent Office, in its words, not a judicial judgment but a mere administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.844" offset="3414706">It viewed them and these are again its words, as merely an instruction to the Commissioner of patent by a court which is made part of the machinery of the Patent Office for administrative purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.512" offset="3457442">Now, as I've said, in 1929, that jurisdiction, the appeal jurisdiction, was transferred to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.967" offset="3495267">And at that time, in transferring the jurisdiction, Congress made no affirmative provision in the statutes for review of Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, patent decisions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.724" offset="3542288">There was a provision for review of the custom's decisions but not the patent decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.186" offset="3556080">Subsequently, and this is I think what really gives rise to the doubts which now as I say subsequently, in 1931 and 1940, in two cases in denying certiorari which was attempted to be taken here from the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.304" offset="3616580">The Court denied certiorari and noted expressly its reliance on Postum and on the absence of any affirmative provision for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.758" offset="3662451">Now it was in -- against this background that the 1948 Judicial Code literally in terms confers jurisdiction over cases, all cases in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.847" offset="3710725">Now, it seems to us that insofar as the decisions after the transfer to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the decision's holding that this Court has no jurisdiction over the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, insofar as they rely as the first one of them expressly relied in part on the lack of any affirmative statutory provision for review, because none did exist at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.718" offset="3818245">The 1948 addition to the statute providing for review in terms would seem to fill a void and confer review here of its own force of decisions of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.934" offset="3875088">In Glidden in fact, Mr. Justice Harlan's plurality opinion, does seem to indicate that it was indeed the lack of affirmative provision at that time which must have been responsible for the Court's decisions after the transfer jurisdiction of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.756" offset="3938408">Glidden held that the Postum decision must be taken to be limited to the statutory scheme in existence before the transfer of patent and trademark litigation to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.751" offset="3986369">What Glidden had in mind was that before the transfer, in fact just at the time of the Postum case, this appeal to jurisdiction was not an alternative as I described it before as being now.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.400" offset="4036942">That is, you didn't have to choose between the appeal jurisdiction and the civil action jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.327" offset="4060662">You could take -- you could do both.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.013" offset="4067453">You could try the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.420" offset="4073096">If you lost then you could come in as civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.071" offset="4083649">And as Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in Glidden pointed out that it must have been quite likely that feature of the review at that time which led the Court in Postum to hold that it was merely advisory, part of the administrative process not a judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.451" offset="4141223">That was eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.242" offset="4152299">The cumulative effect was eliminated in 1927 shortly before the jurisdiction was transferred to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.017" offset="4183437">So that when the jurisdiction was transferred there, it was an alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.733" offset="4202350">It wasn't cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.757" offset="4206425">It didn't have that administrative effect as Glidden pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.294" offset="4224502">And it seems to us that therefore, it may very well be that the decisions after that time, as I say in 1931 and 1940, denying certiorari for lack of jurisdiction citing Postum probably were based upon at that time the lack of any affirmative provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.549" offset="4281553">If there had been one, they would've come out the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.794" offset="4290539">One was supplied in 1948 and there's no reason if that's what the historical analysis is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.870" offset="4318856">There's no reason now not to hear these cases, the statute in ‘48 in fact conferred to jurisdiction, but even if you assumed that, the reasons in 1930 and 1941 after the transfer of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals were constitutional reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.730" offset="4386252">That the Court at that time thought as the court in Postum thought despite the changes in statutory scheme that it was not a judicial thing that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was doing and it was not judicial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.985" offset="4443303">That is no longer true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.249" offset="4452394">Glidden clearly held, no question about it that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals thus exercise Article III business and that everything it does is Article III business and that includes this appeal review of decisions of the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.489" offset="4513311">Now, as Justice Harlan's opinion stated all the business of the court is fully within the category of cases of controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.842" offset="4542777">Now, with that constitutional bar removed, even if it did exist after the transfer to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, I say with the constitutional bar removed, we see no reason not to read Section 1256 to mean what it says, that is that all court cases in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals they're reviewable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.675" offset="4614040">This is, as I say, consistent with the general jurisdiction of this Court with a general purpose to resolve conflicts, with a full conferring of jurisdiction over the Courts of Appeals, for example, the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.771" offset="4670464">To maintain the restriction that would be wholly anomalous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.163" offset="4684048">There's nothing Congress could say now which would be any broader than what it has already said in the 1948 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.468" offset="4713200">Even if there was a constitutional obstacle in '48, we think it's the sound of you to attribute to Congress at that time the purpose to confer on this Court, all the constitutional jurisdiction which this Court can exercise, that's what its language said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.638" offset="4773909">So even if there was a constitutional bar to the exercise of the jurisdiction then when the bar was removed, we see no reason now not to say that the jurisdiction goes up to the constitutional limit which would clearly permit review in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.879" offset="4830856">Now, we recognize that in the past, United States has in briefs in opposition in petitions attempted that we filed from the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, submitted to the court that no jurisdiction did exist in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.160" offset="4888012">Now, that view originated before Glidden and Zdanok had made it clear either that Postum was very narrowly based so that there weren't any constitutional doubts, no constitutional bar in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.117" offset="4927822">Contemporaneously with Glidden, we said to the court that we thought the issue now had become quite doubtful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.985" offset="4951333">And since Glidden in briefs in opposition, we have submitted to the Court that the question should be reexamined in light of the doubts raised by Glidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.755" offset="4986441">We, as I say, reexamined it and I think that I've shown that reexamination in light of Glidden leads you with some confidence to conclude that Section 1256 does indeed confer jurisdiction here now in accordance with its plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.273" offset="5044433">It's our understanding that respondents here agree generally with our conclusion that jurisdiction exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.047" offset="5075571">They seem to argue, however, that the jurisdiction which exists may only be invoked by one party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.765" offset="5102425">That is the patent applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.491" offset="5109321">If he happens to be unsuccessful in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals as he was unsuccessful before the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.551" offset="5141608">But they argue that the jurisdiction may not be invoked by the Commissioner if his refusal to grant a patent is overruled by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.932" offset="5179120">We see little sense in this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.331" offset="5188733">No sense at all, as a matter of fact, and it is also totally unjustified by the statute which just these cases shall be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.650" offset="5225932">All of the reasons for resolving conflicts, all of the reasons for giving the Patent Office a clear guide as to what to do would be frustrated if you say that when the Commissioner lost in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, he couldn't go to the Supreme Court even though the patent applicant could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.253" offset="5284342">Again, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals could, as it did in this case, adopt a more liberal view against the Commissioner and there'd be no way he could resolve this dispute, even though he may very well be right and even though the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was on his side.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.099" offset="6719718">Now, as I say that reason was removed, that reason was compelled by the Postum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.660" offset="6738004">That reason was removed in Glidden and Zdanok just three years ago when the Court held that there was no constitutional bar and in fact it was a judicial jurisdiction of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is exercising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.617" offset="6789831">Since that time, we have not said to the court flatly, do not take this issue, except we have said to the court that the issue is a doubtful one and should be resolved in an appropriate case where it seems that there's also an issue on the merits appropriate for resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.640" offset="6845942">This case is the first one since that time where we believe that there is a substantial issue on the merits coming from the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and therefore we ask the Court to resolve it in this case, since there are too many cases in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals which raise broad issues of law which this Court ought to resolve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.114" offset="7031829">The case involved an application for patent on a chemical process to produce a class of organic compounds with what I find to be an unpronounceable name.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.118" offset="7099852">As I understand it the class, the broad class of compounds known as dihydrotestosterones, they're an organic compound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.897" offset="7134960">I'll call them “the compound”, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.459" offset="7145200">Respondent Manson is the patent applicant for the process to produce this class of compounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.757" offset="7174353">His affidavit on page 33 of the record shows that he's employed by the Sterling-Winthrop Research Institute, which I assume is adjunct of the Sterling Drug Company, and that he's occupied in doing this very thing, producing new organic compounds and processes to produce new organic compounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.210" offset="7248227">And in fact he says that he's produced about 80 of them in the last five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.624" offset="7265886">These things are turned out with great abundance by chemical research companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.415" offset="7289083">Now, Manson applied for patent on his process, in January 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.114" offset="7311862">Manson, however, was not the first person to apply for a patent on the process to produce on this particular process, the one involved in this case, to produce this compound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.969" offset="7363271">In fact, in 1956, two other inventors whose names are Ringold and Rosenkranz, applied for patent on the same process and that patent was issued to them in 1959 even before Manson's application was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.218" offset="7428263">They got a patent on the very same process to produce the very same compounds which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.705" offset="7462222">In doing so, they did allege some utility at that time for their process which is the same process and that can be found on page 57 of the record where their patent is set out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.184" offset="7716133">They might both be pending in the Patent Office at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.048" offset="7727522">In either case, the Act has a provision what's called an interference proceeding and that's what's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.013" offset="7751450">Manson by applying for a patent after Ringold had gotten it was really invoking an interference proceeding and which he wanted it determined who invented the process first, and that's never been determined yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.813" offset="7802650">This case has really decided on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.643" offset="7813935">The reason it's never been determined yet is that the Patent Office said that Manson has not made sufficient allegations in his application and the affidavits accompanying it, the affidavits being filed according to the Patent Office procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.076" offset="7879659">He hadn't made sufficient allegations to entitle him to the patent over Ringold even if everything in his allegations were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.383" offset="7916857">And the reason they said that is that they said that Manson has not alleged in the affidavit he filed that the product of the process was useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.859" offset="7962833">Nor had he alleged that he knew it was useful or that it was useful before Ringold got -- filed his application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.580" offset="8001703">Now, it's common ground that you don't get a patentable invention unless it's a useful invention, although there's a serious dispute of what useful means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.426" offset="8041096">They said, the Patent Office said to Manson, “You have not sufficiently alleged that your invention was useful before Ringold's invention was useful, or at the time that you invented it, it was useful that you knew the use.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.527" offset="8097520">Now, therefore they said, you have -- you can't show, since you haven't alleged that you can't show that you were the prior inventor of this invention accomplishes utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.780" offset="8130539">And therefore, they denied the application and the Board of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.653" offset="8146004">Now, Manson had argued to them two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.663" offset="8154049">One, he said “Oh, I have alleged that the compound -- the product is useful.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.984" offset="8171290">They said, “That's not true.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.287" offset="8176515">They didn't deem his affidavit as sufficient allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.013" offset="8187382">Second, he said, “Even if my affidavit doesn't sufficiently allege that the compound is useful, that's not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.102" offset="8215803">All I have to allege is that the process produces a compound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.930" offset="8231058">You don't have to worry about what the compound is for or what it's not for, so long as it's not harmful, positively evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.926" offset="8259062">But you can assume that the compound just sits there and does nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.967" offset="8275257">It's just a substance which clutters up the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.582" offset="8285706">That doesn't matter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.999" offset="8291349">He said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.346" offset="8296782">The process to produce it is useful because processes are something special.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.561" offset="8313605">The process is so useful if they work, even though they work to produced something that isn't useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.841" offset="8334712">Those were his twin arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.987" offset="8339310">As I say, the Patent Office denied them.On appeal to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, they just addressed themselves to the second argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.951" offset="8367208">They didn't go into to the question of whether he had a sufficiently alleged the use for the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.382" offset="8384867">They said, “You don't have to.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.877" offset="8390928">All you have to allege is what he undeniably did allege and that is that the process works to produce the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.687" offset="8422170">And they said, “If you do that, if you allege the process works to produce a product, then you've alleged enough to entitle you a patent if you can prove it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.784" offset="8454457">Now, this decision applies not only to interference cases, it applies to all patent applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.831" offset="8482670">And although that Manson came in forgetting about Ringold with exactly the same patent application just alleging that the process worked to produce Product X, but saying nothing about what Product X could be used for and not used for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.895" offset="8534915">The Patent Office said, “Well you got to say what the use of the product is.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.107" offset="8551842">This decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals would hold that he didn't have to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.274" offset="8572426">That that's enough that he could get a patent on any of these processes which he invents.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.215" offset="8640240">And in fact Mr. Justice Harlan, it was the -- it was the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals position in 1950 in the case called In re Bremner where the court said it was never intended that a patent be granted upon a product or a process producing a product unless such product be useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.947" offset="8727176">This was the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in 1950, and as I understand that that reflect what the Commissioner then did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.211" offset="8756224">I'm not absolutely sure of that, but that's my understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.462" offset="8769181">Since then, the Commissioner has adhered to that and if the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals which is slowly retreated from in it in a series of decisions which we set out in a long footnote in the brief until they finally reached the position they taken this case, and that is a process is something different from a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.184" offset="8844100">They say the Bremner case is right as to products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.395" offset="8856952">A product, you can't get a patent on a product unless the product was useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.662" offset="8873984">Well, they say that's not true as to processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.107" offset="8883806">With processes, it's enough to show that the process produces a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.804" offset="8902614">You don't have to show that the product was useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.975" offset="8915257">Now, we -- it's clear that no one contested the fact that the Constitution requires in so many words, and the Patent Act has always required in the same route that a patentable invention be useful and we simply don't believe that you can say with any reason or logic that a process is useful even though its sole use is to produce a product which is entirely useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.125" offset="9035839">That just doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.488" offset="9045347">And as I say, that was the view of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, clear in 1950 and until this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.717" offset="11902203">Now, I agree there are arguments on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.061" offset="11911607">It seems to me that putting that light, the arguments clearly don't favor giving a patent because there are all these arguments and all these reasons why the patent might act as a depressant upon scientific research.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.401" offset="11956955">The fact is, however, that you just shouldn't make the distinction between process patents in this regards and product patents in this regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.428" offset="12097076">Now there, it seems to me, you've got an encouragement which will substantially help society by asking them to look for the use and by not giving them the patent and the monopoly until they do get the use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.438" offset="12137096">In some, the patent system is designed to give society things that are useful to society and you don't give patents unless you have some assurance at the time you give some reason to believe at the time you're given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.611" offset="12209821">That's the thing you're giving a patent on that will be useful to society, otherwise, you're just floating a negative monopoly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.833" offset="13710712">After having described, the very compound produced by the process here in issue, but by a different process, the article says, “While anti-tumor screening of the above described 2-methyl hormones is still in progress, 1A and 2A which are other members of this class of hormones to which the 2-methyl hormones belong have already been shown to be very effective tumor inhibitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.453" offset="13817187">Now, that is the starting point, the takeoff in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.797" offset="13834533">There was a journal article, and in that journal article, it told us a way of making the compound which the process here in issue makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.166" offset="13879986">So we have an alternative and second way of making the compounds described in that journal article.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.329" offset="13916662">Now, after the journal article was published, Ringold filed a patent application and got a patent, and they claimed a different process from that of the journal article involving only one-step method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.559" offset="13977579">The first, the journal article shows about I think a three or four-step method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.884" offset="13998895">After Ringold got his patent, Manson filed an application, timely, there's been no argument about that and in full compliance with all of the rules of practice and the statutes relating to the proper filing of an application, copied a claim, two claims out of the Ringold patent, the process claims which are here in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.520" offset="14105475">And said, “I think I invented that process, that single step process not the process of the article but the single step process before Ringold, the patentee, invented it and I want a chance to contest priority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.576" offset="14177677">And when that occurs, the Patent Office rules provide Rule 204 (b) as it then stood provided that one must file an affidavit which makes a prima facie case of having invented the subject matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="6064.142" offset="24359894">We say -- we do agree with the petitioner that this Court now has clearly the jurisdiction to review cases coming on from the lower court where they originated in the Patent Office Board of Appeals, but we say that that is true only when the appellant losses below and not when the Commissioner is reversed below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.259" offset="24492387">And I will try to boil this down into five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.990" offset="24515375">We have to go back to 1839 and remember that from that time on, there have been alternative routes provided for review of an adverse decision by the Commissioner of Patents on a patent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.803" offset="24578591">The alternative routes have taken various forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.306" offset="24592593">They've gone through Chief Justice of the old District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia from 1839 to 1852.</text>
            <text syncTime="6130.084" offset="24623731">They went through the old Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and there was a court called the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.515" offset="24657481">And all of this time, there was the one alternative route which went up and was cumulative between 1839 and 1927 in this respect, and a defeated applicant could elect to go one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.894" offset="24730937">And when he got beaten up there, he could come back and have his bill in equity remedy all the way through and take the normal course of a bill in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6168.011" offset="24775450">However, between those years of 1836 to 1948, the Commissioner never had any right by statute to go any further if the applicant/appellant, was successful in his alternative route.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.411" offset="24868968">Now, when it comes down to a matter of statutory construction and when Congress puts in a statute saying that there shall be, as it did in 1948, a petition for certiorari, then we have to look.</text>
            <text syncTime="6210.533" offset="24945455">I should've added something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6212.865" offset="24954859">In 1927, the routes were no longer alternative and cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6218.455" offset="24977220">They were split.</text>
            <text syncTime="6220.819" offset="24986624">And the applicant had to elect which way he'd go, and if he elected the so-called alternative route as opposed to bill in equity route that was the end of the road for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6231.330" offset="25028733">If he got locked there, he couldn't come back and have his bill in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.027" offset="25043466">Now, when we look at a statute to determine the purpose of 1256 which is the certiorari statute here, what was Congress trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.622" offset="25085889">Were they trying to effect a change in policy or to formulate a new plan of judicial review?</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.697" offset="25114206">We submit that what occurred here is simply that Congress realized all at once or there used to be, and there was for 112 years, an alternative and cumulative route.</text>
            <text syncTime="6266.595" offset="25169795">Go one way you get a week, come back, go by bill in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.207" offset="25188185">And we took that away in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.977" offset="25203231">Now, when we put in this Section 1256 we restore, there's no change in policy, we restore the historic right of an applicant/appellant who was defeated in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to have a try for petition to this Court, and that it was not the intention of the court to change the situation as to the Commissioner of Patents who had never had any right for 112 years to go beyond the decision of the alternative court if he got leaked there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.719" offset="25358294">And the reason we say that is specifically is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6316.513" offset="25369475">The legislative history of the first four drafts of Section 1256 contained the words, cases in the CCPA may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by certiorari granted on petition of any party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.373" offset="25436871">Those words ‘of any party' were taken out before the bill was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6338.618" offset="25457873">Now, if you will look at Section 1244, you will observe -- 1254, that's the statute coming up by the bill in equity, you'll observe the words that of any party are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.524" offset="25505520">And 1255 which deals with a review of cases in the Court of Claims have the word petition of the United States or the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6360.325" offset="25544704">We submit the omission of that language of any party was deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6364.738" offset="25562363">The significance of the omission of the ‘any party' language is further brought out by looking at the legislative history and the parallel as here of Section 1255 which started with the words ‘of any party' and those words were changed to read of the United States or the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6381.832" offset="25630699">Now, we think when they took the words out of any party, the reason for it was this that it was deliberate and the reason was this.Looking at Section 1244 -- I'm sorry 244, I'll get it straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="6396.977" offset="25691303">Section 144 of 35 U.S.C, if you go back in the history of that action, here's what that provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.225" offset="25724322">It provides that upon the determination of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, they shall return to the Commissioner a certificate of its proceedings and decision which shall be entered the record of the patent laws and govern the further proceedings in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6419.162" offset="25780015">We think it governs the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6420.605" offset="25785762">And I'll go all the way back to the Patent Act of 1836 where the statute was a little more specific at that time and said that there shall be a decision by the appellant or in a route tribunal and their opinion being certified to the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6439.367" offset="25860890">He shall be governed thereby in the further proceedings that we have any application.</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.231" offset="25876250">And that language is persisted right down to the present time that the Patent Office gets -- the Commissioner gets back a certificate and the Patent Office shall be governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6454.028" offset="25919509">And therefore, if it's governed, it doesn't have any right to appeal and it never had a right of appeal historically for a 100 -- appeal or petition to go beyond if the appellant elected the alternative route, the Commissioner never having a right to go any farther if he got leaked.</text>
            <text syncTime="6474.969" offset="26003205">And we submit therefore that historically, he should not have that right now and it was not the intent or purpose of Congress to restore that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.951" offset="26047195">And they so indicated when they took out those words of any party from the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="6539.922" offset="26263071">We say there is a preliminary question here which must be decided before the Court gets even to the merits question at all, and that was that the primary examiner who decided the affidavits could not comply had no authority to make that decision because under Section 135 of Title 35, only the Board of Patent and Interferences can make any determination of priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6565.289" offset="26364531">And what the examiner was doing was making a determination of priority here in this case when he said, “Your affidavits are not sufficient to entitle you to get into the interference.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.868" offset="26406849">He effectively made that determination of priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.305" offset="26416567">He thereby usurped the function of the board of patent interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6581.289" offset="26428479">And I mentioned this earlier that Rule 204 (b) has been amended so that the primary examiner no longer makes the kind of determinations which he made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6591.542" offset="26469543">This case is moot as far as Rule 204 (b) is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6594.672" offset="26482082">That rule has been amended so that now all the primary examiner does is look at the affidavit to see that there's a date in there before filing date of the patentee, then he declares the interference and fires it over to the Board of Patent and Interferences where it belongs to be determined.</text>
