            <text syncTime="291.737" offset="1271390">He doesn't merely get up there and say, "This book has value" and leave the Court, and there can be testimony on the other side as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.793" offset="1307544">It is for this Court to read the record, to appraise the testimony, and to decide whether really a case has been made out for social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.739" offset="1359370">The witnesses in this case didn't make conclusory statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.679" offset="1375148">They analyzed the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.178" offset="1385075">They spoke of the various canons of literary criticism that are to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.416" offset="1410048">They found the book good under those canons.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.784" offset="1427498">Now, in opposition there was one witness, and we would leave to the Court the appraisal of his testimony as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.372" offset="1477862">He was a witness who spoke in conclusory terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.165" offset="1501059">He called the book obscene and prurient.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.036" offset="1512552">He said that prurient meant esoteric.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.321" offset="1529689">When asked if that was really the word he meant, he said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.981" offset="1544317">When he was asked who it was that the heroine had married at the end of the book, he couldn't remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.240" offset="1569395">He referred to Jane Austen as an 18th Century novelist.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.564" offset="1586636">While all of these things can be considered, at the same time the Court can consider the qualifications and the statements of Professor Fred Stocking, Chairman of the Department of Literature of Williams College, Professor John Bullitt Professor of English and Master of Quincy House at Harvard, Professor Holland of MIT, Professor Sproat of Boston University and the rest of the witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.159" offset="4109019">-- the two states in which the cases reached the highest court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.898" offset="4128037">There was a trial in New Jersey which held against the book and the appeal there has been held in advance pending the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.357" offset="4169832">I would like, if I may, to mention the brief amicus that was filed without consent of the parties but with the permission of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.410" offset="4230019">That brief deserves special mention because I think it represents more truly than the brief of the Attorney General, the nature of the opposition to this book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.156" offset="4289055">The brief proceeds from Curll's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.957" offset="4300236">It cites that case eight times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.424" offset="4314133">Curll's case was decided in the first year of the reign of George II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.884" offset="4331896">Curll was a rather rambunctious publisher who was held into court for two things he published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.236" offset="4357392">One was a book that the government felt -- brought the government into disrepute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.478" offset="4382260">The other was a book that the government felt was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.509" offset="4398456">The court in the obscenity case decided that obscenity was a common law crime and they decided it on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.183" offset="4441088">They accepted the argument of the Attorney General there that a breach of the king's peace is a common law of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.441" offset="4482152">That a breach of the king's peace can come from writing and he said it comes from three kinds of writing -- writing that tends to bring the government into disrepute, writing that tends to go against religion, and writing that tends to go against morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.228" offset="4565326">The Court agreed with him on all three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.676" offset="4579119">Now, I think this is extremely important because it shows exactly what the kind of opposition to publication is that is found in the anti-obscenity laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.954" offset="4780262">The bookseller later was prosecuted but it appears that the book was not an authentic copy of the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.409" offset="4806071">This book throughout its history has had sort of a reverse bowdlerizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.877" offset="4823939">People have added things rather than taking them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.384" offset="4837940">They've added illustrations for example and an illustration formed the basis of a case in 1821 in Massachusetts in which a defendant named Holmes was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.665" offset="4903037">I want to say one more thing on a question that was asked previously and that has to do with the state and federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.485" offset="4946296">I want to call to the Court's attention, certain practical considerations that should affect the legal conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.740" offset="4987361">An author lives in one state, a publisher publishes in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.591" offset="5006796">The book is printed and bound in a third and it's distributed by wholesalers everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.383" offset="5029888">None of these people observe state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.653" offset="5043054">In New Jersey, there was a stipulation that the book was would not be distributed during the pendency of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.673" offset="5071057">Some books got into Campton because the Philadelphia wholesaler covers South Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.062" offset="5100628">It is just not consonant with the realities of modern publishing to attempt a state-by-state censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.202" offset="5145245">It -- we cannot have some states in which a book is published and others in which it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.249" offset="5169382">A publisher cannot gauge his ability to publish which comes down to a matter of money in that way.</text>
