            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Sylvester Johnson and Stanley Cassidy, Petitioner, versus New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.376" offset="128920">Mr. Heine, you may continue with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman Heine</label>
            <text syncTime="10.074" offset="143653">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.956" offset="159222">Before yesterday's recess, I believe I reached the point in my statement of the facts which indicated that the petitioner's confessions were admittedly voluntary and admittedly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.070" offset="211675">At the trial, the petitioner's guilt was freely conceded and admitted beyond any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.283" offset="240515">The sole thrust of the defense of the trial was a plea by their attorneys for mercy or leniency on behalf of their clients, merely for the purpose of refreshing the Court's recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.199" offset="296208">I refer the Court to page 270 of the record were Cassidy's attorney told the jury and I quote, “That the defendants did not take the stand because he could not honestly deny that which is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.507" offset="357439">He did not take the stand”, he continued to say, “to conjure of stories or lies, the facts or as they -- as they were presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.131" offset="399862">That which he said has been introduced as testimony in this case and that which he said is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.483" offset="425253">There is nothing more you can say”, that was the end of his quote.</text>

            <text syncTime="96.805" offset="490559">No, I don't think it has any relevance because the denial that it was true at the trial came a year after the trial for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.001" offset="527339">That was the first inkling that anyone had any different concept of the voluntariness or the truthfulness of it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman Heine</label>
            <text syncTime="121.243" offset="588361">And the other defense counsel summation, Johnson's attorney, in the summation said, “The statement of Johnson was truthful and honest.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.225" offset="624306">They have no testimony whatsoever to change it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.260" offset="648443">I also pointed out yesterday that the psychiatric and psychological reports that were referred to by the petitioners are not part of this record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.068" offset="695672">They were actually not part of any record so far as being proven or admitted into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.590" offset="721690">They were merely attached to the petition for habeas in the Federal District Court and came up to the Circuit Court of Appeals by way of printing the petition for habeas that was filed below.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.799" offset="770591">Objection to their use and reference was made by the state in the District Court and again in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.680" offset="806118">Significantly, these reports were never offered or even more or even made available to our state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.673" offset="838092">They never had them.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.331" offset="844675">Since this matter is a review of our state court opinion, I fail to see how they can be used or referred to in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.882" offset="882918">I objected to the inclusion of these reports in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.941" offset="899114">I was advised to note my objection in our brief which we did on page 10 because the doctors or the authors of these reports were never examined or cross examined to explain their reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.186" offset="956165">At the same time, I again refer to the fact that the affidavits that were referred to and relied upon by these defendants in order to make up and assert a factual situation pertaining to this petition, pertaining to their claims, as not being advised of their rights to remain silent that they were held incommunicado from their families, that they were denied, their request of counsel and were denied the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.034" offset="1067551">All of which facts they now assert were not denied or contradicted by the State and now assert them as being uncontroverted facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.909" offset="1102973">Common to this case by the way of filing of these affidavits in our Supreme Court, the New Jersey, when the post conviction appeal was being considered, this is contrary to our local practice and the State had no way of knowing that these affidavits would be received or even considered by our Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.952" offset="1199208">The -- our Supreme Court, that's the State Supreme Court in its opinion filed in this record and I refer the Court to page 346 said this in their opinion, “On their appeal to this Court, the defendant submitted affidavits in support of their grounds for relief”.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.514" offset="1273396">The Court's opinion further points out that these allegations, that is of the affidavits, were not made in any of the prior proceedings nor in their present petitions to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.852" offset="1326791">The defendants made these allegations for the first time in their affidavits submitted to this Court, denial of an opportunity to counsel, to consult with an attorney and failure to be advised of the right to remain silent or factors relevant to the issue of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.640" offset="1393977">The Court then went on to say, “If these allegations are made on that issue, our consideration is precluded by our prior judgment”.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.133" offset="1443924">The State Supreme Court had moved on the question of voluntariness once before certiorari was denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.622" offset="1485824">The Federal District Court had ruled on the question of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.692" offset="1502124">And on appeal, the Court of Appeals reviewed the question of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.748" offset="1518320">On the merits, certiorari from the Court of Appeals was again denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.621" offset="1549876">Our State Supreme Court then considered the proposition that assuming the affidavits bring the case into Escobedo and assuming further that Escobedo introduces a new constitutional concept separate and apart from the issue of voluntariness should this concept be applied retrospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.550" offset="1645589">This brings us face to face with the main subject matter as I conceive of this review that we're arguing today.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.151" offset="1679966">The State holds that Escobedo should not be applied retrospectively and these are my reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.678" offset="1722075">From 1951 down to -- down to and including Escobedo, all held that incriminating statements obtained in the absence of counsel even after the defendants had clearly become the focus of police investigation and had request the counsel was no constitutional bar to a valid conviction where the statements were not otherwise involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.787" offset="1842552">In Haynes, this Court said and they reiterated that the admissibility of a pretrial statement depended on its voluntariness although absence of warning of a right to remain silent, delay in arraignment, and lack of opportunity to consult with the family and counsel were factors to be assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.689" offset="1922173">Therefore we say, we're still dealing with the question of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.219" offset="1944221">We think that Escobedo is more akin to Mapp than it is to Gideon.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.870" offset="1974836">The reason I say that is because Gideon was applied retroactively, Mapp was not and either was Griffin of course versus California by way of the Tehan opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.666" offset="2017991">These are the factors that I think ought to be considered by this Court in deciding the question of whether or not to apply this decision retrospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.929" offset="2063130">One, the reliability of the guilt determining process was seriously impugned in Gideon and not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.952" offset="2115166">It offends our sense of justice to continue to incarcerate a convicted man where subsequent considerations cast grave doubts upon the reliability of the determination of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.424" offset="2165112">So where a man is tried without a lawyer, we don't really know whether he was guilty or whether the acts that he committed constitute a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.621" offset="2197817">However here, the case in our case, the confessions were admittedly voluntarily, and admittedly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.788" offset="2238568">So we don't have any question to concern ourselves on the reliability of the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.632" offset="2261870">Again, I would point out that when Gideon overruled Betts v. Brady case, only a few states still denied counsel to the accused in the trial in a none capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.941" offset="2311084">However, when Escobedo was decided, almost all of the states including our own state permitted the introduction of voluntary confessions given even in the absence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.116" offset="2375868">I will also suggest to this Court that society reasonably expects that when a man is convicted of a crime by a method not considered unfair according to the rules of law, then in effect and approved by this Honorable Court, that that conviction will stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.779" offset="2470536">And finally, I would say and point out to this Court that the retroactive application of Escobedo would invalidate far more convictions throughout the country than even Gideon did because one, we would invalidate convictions that were based on confessions, and as a part of that same kind, we would also open the gates to those who pleaded guilty based on the fact that the State had a confession in their files and a trial would be futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.955" offset="2611179">So therefore, we wouldn't have no way of knowing really what was the basis of what -- who -- what and who would be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.397" offset="2640959">For these reasons, I would submit to this respectful Court that the conviction should be affirmed and the opinion of the Supreme Court of New Jersey be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.387" offset="2744926">And I'd say at the outset that we wished to agree with the position of the Solicitor General as to his frame of reference for Escobedo in self-incriminating statements and particularly as to the necessity for an adequate warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.861" offset="2806784">Of course in our case, the warning which is pointed out in page 12 of the brief which was given repeatedly was no warning by any stretch of the imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.762" offset="2842415">It was simply that first, the chief of police said, “I'm going to ask you some questions about a holdup and it's my duty to warn you everything you tell me must be of your own freewill, must be the truth, without any promise or threats being made to you, and knowing anything you can tell me, we maybe use it against you or any other person”.</text>
