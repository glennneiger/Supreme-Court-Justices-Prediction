            <text syncTime="27.823" offset="214706">We are here today on a very narrow question.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.375" offset="244903">It is a question having to do with the summary jurisdiction of the referee in bankruptcy and involved in the question is the problem of whether the Seventh Amendment prevents the exercise of summary jurisdiction by a referee in bankruptcy where if a plenary action were filed a jury trial would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.804" offset="386591">We are before the Court on a question as to which there is difference of opinion among the circuits as to the extent of the summary jurisdiction which a referee in bankruptcy has or attempts to exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.708" offset="478229">The Tenth Circuit probably goes farther than any other circuit in its recognition of summary jurisdiction and it holds if I correctly understand the most recent decision of the Tenth Circuit that summary -- that in an instance where a creditor files a claim in a bankruptcy estate and where the trustee seeks to assert a preference by way of counterclaim back against that creditor, the Tenth Circuit apparently go host that the summary jurisdiction does exist if the counterclaim is either compulsory or permissive or would be under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if a preference or one or two other things are involved and if the matter is not wholly unrelated to the claim initially filed by the creditor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred M. Winner</label>
            <text syncTime="184.762" offset="842376">Yes sir in the Katchen case, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.410" offset="853034">I read the Katchen case to modify an earlier decision of the Tenth Circuit in Interstate, but I believe or I hope I have correctly summarized Katchen as decided by the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.952" offset="903189">I think that perhaps the problem can be best illustrated by a very brief recitation of the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.535" offset="949478">Here a corporation was formed in April 1960 which had the name of Katchen's Bonus Corner Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.938" offset="987094">Contemporaneously with the formation of the corporation, Louis Katchen, the principle stockholder borrowed $40,000.00 from the American National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.975" offset="1039235">Now in fact, the note was signed by Katchen's Bonus Corner Incorporated and Louis Katchen was the accommodation maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.227" offset="1088240">A few months later, $10,000.00 was borrowed from the North Denver Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.898" offset="1114990">Not very long thereafter, they had a disastrous fire which was uninsured.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.814" offset="1146650">Within four months of the date of bankruptcy, the corporation caused first $15,000.00 and later an additional of $10,000.00 to be paid on the American National Bank loan on which Louis Katchen was an accommodation maker and did also cause to be paid in full the note to the North Denver Bank on which Katchen was an accommodation maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.936" offset="1263156">Subsequent to that and prior to bankruptcy, but all within the four months, Katchen paid personally an additional $5,000.00 on the American National Bank note.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.275" offset="1324492">Following bankruptcy, Katchen filed a claim as a creditor of the bankrupt corporation for the last $5,000.00 I have mentioned, that is the $5,000.00 which he paid personally on the note and he filed a claim for approximately $4,500.00 worth of rent said to be due him by the corporation on real property he personally owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.348" offset="1444760">The trustee then asserted four counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.758" offset="1474435">The four counterclaims were these; the first two involved the payments, the payments which had been made by the corporation on the American National Bank note.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.890" offset="1526888">The third one involved the payment made by the corporation on the North Denver Bank note and the fourth one involved a claim which -- in which the trustee said that Louis Katchen had failed to subscribe for his initial capital stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.222" offset="1604211">The Tenth Circuit held that the claim on the failure to subscribe for the capital stock was wholly unrelated to Katchen's claims and therefore, the trustee could not exercise summary jurisdiction over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.704" offset="1686235">But the Tenth Circuit held that the referee could exercise summary jurisdiction as to the three payments made by corporate funds on the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.341" offset="1736704">It is undisputed that Katchen objected to the summary jurisdiction at the first available opportunity and as I have said the question we have here today is, can a referee in bankruptcy exercise that summary jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="425.801" offset="1806608">Now as we view it, the various circuits which have passed on the question and some of them saying they can exercise of just compulsory counterclaims some on permissive and some on -- or some on both permissive and counterclaim, an attempt seems to go all from a slightly different tension --</text>

            <text syncTime="475.341" offset="2004720">The Interstate case out of the Tenth Circuit specifically made reference to Rules 13 (a) and (b) the permissive and the compulsory counterclaim rules under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the seem to key it into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.902" offset="2058951">But I don't understand exactly how it keys in other than its -- the circuit did do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.711" offset="2098239">Which maybe perfectly proper not by analogy but by definition the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not in full force and in -- apply the action before the referee in bankruptcy?</text>

          <turn speaker="fred_m_winner" startTime="511.621" stopTime="956.030">
            <label>Mr. Fred M. Winner</label>
            <text syncTime="511.621" offset="2149857">I believe that is correct, Your Honor, I think clearly it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.777" offset="2166471">I think that all of the circuits in arriving at their -- in arriving at their results have fundamentally relied upon the decision of this Court in Alexander against Hillman and they read Alexander against Hillman in the way that I just simply cannot read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.924" offset="2267094">Alexander against Hillman was not a bankruptcy matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.340" offset="2292694">Alexander against Hillman was an equity receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.928" offset="2319130">In Alexander against Hillman after the receivership was started to wind up the affairs of the corporation, some of the corporate officers filed a claim in the receivership.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.898" offset="2394990">The receiver filed equitable counterclaims against the corporate officer and this Court held that equity having assumed jurisdiction it would certainly exercise jurisdiction as to all equitable matters and the matter came up primarily as a question of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.900" offset="2482970">It said that venue had been consented to and it held that in an equity receivership as to equitable counterclaims, the Court did have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.656" offset="2545977">But there are these distinctions between Alexander against Hillman and the summary jurisdiction which is attempted to be exercised by a bankruptcy referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.801" offset="2598536">First is the most obvious distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.007" offset="2611388">An equitable receivership is not bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.087" offset="2627688">Second is the second most obvious distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.489" offset="2645347">In Alexander against Hillman, the jurisdiction was exercised as to equitable counterclaims, but in the case today before the Court, the counterclaims are not equitable, they are legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.989" offset="2707310">They are counterclaims for money had and received.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.024" offset="2731447">And if the plenary action had been filed and clearly it could have been, a jury could have been demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.539" offset="2769481">The next distinction as I mentioned is that Alexander against Hillman, as we understand the case, involved only and completely the equitable issues coupled with the venue problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.213" offset="2856208">That I think is a distinction which cannot be said to exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.269" offset="2896436">Here we have, as I have said, then counterclaims involving legal issues as to which a jury trial could be demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.746" offset="2950353">And we think that has been settled and settled by this Court and I make mention of Schoenthal versus Irving Trust, this in an opinion written by Mr. Justice Butler in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.458" offset="3021197">There, there was a plenary action filed to recover a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.409" offset="3045021">Here clearly, a plenary action could have been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.035" offset="3063515">There the case was assigned in the District Court to the equity side of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.287" offset="3104475">A demand was made for a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.757" offset="3118373">This Court held as to an identical type of preference that the preference claim was an action for money had and received that it was error to hear the case on the equity side of the Court and that the defendant was entitled to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.529" offset="3229445">We cannot distinguish that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.931" offset="3247104">The only thing that can be done as we see it to get around that case is to say that Alexander against Hillman overruled it, but Alexander against Hillman was written only three years after the Schoenthal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.999" offset="3331323">It was again written by Mr. Justice Butler and makes no mention of the Schoenthal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.399" offset="3368939">We submit that Alexander against Hillman does not stand in anyway for the propositions for which it has been cited by the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.771" offset="3430484">As is pointed out in Daniel against Guaranty Trust once more written in 1932, this time by Mr. Justice McReynolds.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.407" offset="3469040">There the strict question of preference was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.003" offset="3495372">Guaranty Trust within the bankruptcy proceeding had filed a reclamation of certain bonds and the trustee filed a counterclaim against Guaranty Trust and in that counterclaim asked to recover money which the trustee said Guaranty Trust had received after the bankruptcy adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.546" offset="3597563">This Court there pointed out that to put upon a creditor almost, well, this isn't the Court's language of course, but to put on upon a creditor almost the problem of Russian roulette, when you file a claim in a bankruptcy, the Court would be completely unfair that the argument which is made in some of the circuit court opinions that anybody who files a lawsuit is subjected to the hazard of a counterclaim that that argument does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.598" offset="3733713">Sure, you're always subjected to the hazards of a counterclaim, but you're subjected to the hazards of a counterclaim in a court where all of the orderly processes of the court should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.354" offset="3788779">And to say that a creditor who by exercising is very, very lawful right of seeking to recover his portion of a debt out of a bankruptcy estate must then subject himself to the risk of a counterclaim based upon a preference without the protections of a full trial in a plenary action is to make the filing of a claim in a bankruptcy estate a matter of serious risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.086" offset="5387682">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.005" offset="5407431">Counsel has mentioned that the issues in this case are narrow and they are in the sense that factually it is uncomplicated narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.898" offset="5466990">They are broad in a legal sense in that fundamentally, what is involved in the case seems to be the very foundation and fundamental of bankruptcy law and bankruptcy administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.561" offset="5541595">Mr. Winner has summarized it quite accurately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.760" offset="5554448">I think the facts about which there is no dispute and thus the Court has doubtless noticed from a record that there is almost no factual problem presented by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.360" offset="5604812">Three claims, two of them effectively the same were allowed two different payments to one bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.021" offset="5631457">And a third claim which was a similar payment to another bank were allowed as preferences; fourth, which was a stock matter was not permitted by the circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.510" offset="5681403">Now, we certainly do have very clearly involved here of the problem of Alexander versus Hillman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.952" offset="5723199">It is categorical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.308" offset="5732603">Alexander versus Hillman came out from the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.837" offset="5750680">It is a receivership case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.415" offset="5761024">It is a receivership case which has this great cogency to bankruptcy we believe as a receivership case well might have or as any case might have of what the Court said which is cogent in Hillman applies to bankruptcy quite as much as it applies to the receivership situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.081" offset="5867708">All that had occurred was that there – was a receiver having the assets of an insolvent person in hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.826" offset="5898637">Other persons, who were debtors or might have been, made the application to share in the receivership assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.382" offset="5928939">It was held that having made application to the receiver to share in those assets claims with the receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.018" offset="5959450">The receiver had a right to offset or to counterclaim on other claims that might be held against the particular persons making the claim and the Court simply said and I think we quote Hillman at 11 of the brief, of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.341" offset="6040743">Respondent's contention means that while they invoke in the Court's jurisdiction to establish their right to participate in distribution, they may deny its power to require them to account for what they misappropriated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.997" offset="6091316">In behalf of creditors and stockholders, the receivers reasonably may insist that before taking out respondents made by the receivership of the Court be required to make restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.013" offset="6139382">The requirement is in harmony with the rule generally followed by the courts of equity that having jurisdiction of the parties to controversies brought before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.541" offset="6173550">They will decide all matters in dispute and to create a complete relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.821" offset="6190686">Distribution may not be made without decisions of the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.955" offset="6207195">Nothing is marked there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.005" offset="6211375">They are part of the subject matter of the main suit than recovery that all through there is belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.233" offset="6236348">I think that is probably the essence of Hillman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.554" offset="6249618">Now, the problem is, does that apply in bankruptcy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.461" offset="6269262">Counsel says, that it is alleged and stated by the Court in other cases that there is a jury right with reference to the recovery of a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.944" offset="6327150">What counsel that does not do is to draw the distinction of that such a case is a case in which there has not been a claim made in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.174" offset="6380022">The case is not pending in bankruptcy upon a claim of the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.237" offset="6404368">It is one of those situations in which the trustee having such assets as would be assets of the bankrupt state may go out as a party into other parts and bring an ordinary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.254" offset="6460374">He might bring an action I presume in tort and might frequently do and such a tort action would not be an action in bankruptcy but a declaration that it was not, would not have anything to do with a claim made in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.407" offset="6524949">There perhaps also is an off discussion of the issue by a reference to the summary jurisdiction in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.386" offset="6568939">Bankruptcy is a kind of thing that is sui generis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.411" offset="6589001">It is not legal jurisdiction, while legal jurisdiction it is an equitable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.002" offset="6615333">Now the Court has said it applies basically equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.920" offset="6631006">It is an extremely broad jurisdiction to meet a specific type of the recurrent and critical economic problem which obviously has its origins in constitutional power in exactly the same fashion the Seventh Amendment guarantee has and the power this Court has said is a --- rather plenary power vested in the Congress over the whole subject of bankruptcies and then the Court has defined subject to bankruptcies extremely broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.335" offset="6764753">Now, the statute says specifically Section 2a-7 of the Act through 11a-7 U.S.C that the courts of the United States are hereby invested with such jurisdiction to pause the stage of the bankrupt to be collected, reduce the money distributed and determine controversies in relation thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.811" offset="6862660">Now, what are the basic types of controversies?</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.330" offset="6876662">Well, the essential controversy in bankruptcy is who gets the money that usually it's what occurs and the way you determine it is that the claimants file their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.783" offset="6930474">Each claim filed in bankruptcy for every practical purpose is simply a lawsuit instituted against the trustee by the claimant asserting that he has the right to part of whatever is in the hands of or maybe garnered by of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.141" offset="6995884">If this is a lawsuit and it is a controversy then we would submit that might other lawsuits it has a reverse and then adverse, and the Court trying to completely adjudicate it, must look at its reverse and must look at its odd versus wealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.657" offset="7069968">Now, if it is such a claim then certainly counterclaims or set-offs must be ascertained to determine if there is a right fundamentally to receive anything out of the pool of the assets and if this is a type of matter applying rules of equitable cognizance as we suppose that it is and as the Court has stated repeatedly that it is, then necessarily, there must be an avoidance of circulative litigation in the matter and there must be avoidance or a determination of whatever is implicit in determining the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.194" offset="7244152">But how do you determine if somebody has a right to draw money out of the pool without determining whether that person is of necessity required to contribute into the pool out of which money maybe drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.290" offset="7304547">In the first instance, the statute says first; that the courts of the United States have the right to settle the estate of the bankrupt to collect, reduce the money distributed, and determine controversies in the relation thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.185" offset="7364106">And the third Section 1668 I believe say that it is incumbent upon the Court also to make determinations of preferences, set-offs and all of the rest of the equitable claims that may derive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.669" offset="8502000">But this, of course, hits at the very heart of what the problem is because it means that in every single case of bankruptcy and in a major bankruptcy, there maybe several hundred claims sometimes many thousands but several hundred is not unusual then you must go into a -- an investigation in plenary suit of all these matters in each claim holding the entire administration of bankruptcy in suspense until such time as you contemplate the entire plenary operation which effectively means that the entire bankrupt of the state must be dissipated and will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.931" offset="8667094">And that the fundamental function restorative and distributive of bankruptcy has to be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.665" offset="8698023">There – there is underlying all of this a notion that the summary jurisdiction is something sinister.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.282" offset="8784541">But this Court has pointed out frequently that it is merely because the United States judge is a judge in bankruptcy having the right to refer matters to referees and also having the right I presume to people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.211" offset="8840234">Now the matter in bankruptcy for summary jurisdiction then is the basic jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to administer a system of law which is sui generis highly emulative and palliative in its nature and intended primarily in the states as distinguished from England to be restorative in its effect and certainly having a tremendously significant basic economic function and modality of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.277" offset="8980459">If it is necessary to say that every action where there maybe thought to be involved a claim for a preference must involve a plenary action in a -- another court then bankruptcy of itself must grind to a rather dreadful halt and that what is it is what I would submit is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.700" offset="9098219">It is really what most of the writers have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.907" offset="9110967">Now the conclusions as to the Hillman application to the bankruptcy situation were drawn first in Florance against Kresge which was asserted which was reversed in Hillman.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.035" offset="9711470">But it certainly would seem to clear that once the party who is a claimant makes an election to come into a bankruptcy court and start a suit effectively against the trustee, then he must be prepared to defend against the trustee and that this is certainly a different situation from one in which he does not come into bankruptcy but the trustee as a suitor goes into a federal court or a state court to get an asset in the same manner which somebody else might have gotten one had the bankruptcy not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.714" offset="9874265">In this regard, we -- we get into the problem of a jury question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2464.213" offset="9960260">And again right I guess is in the ethical, philosophical sense rather than a legal sense because it is in assertion of what – what the person asserting at things ought to be the case which is always one must predicate of a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.121" offset="10035806">But what the Constitution says relative to the matter is simply that the right to jury trial in actions at common law shall be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.747" offset="10090350">Now it doesn't go out guarded for a battle to create such a right where there isn't one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.417" offset="10129011">And in the situation of accounting marshaling of assets and complex economic cost data of this type, the jury has not been thought to be in many cases indispensable and in others has been thought to be downright futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.391" offset="10224933">In any case Colorado under the authority a counsel cites has long recognized that there is no summary right to jury trial and that in a matter of accounting actions and the like probably there isn't any at all even when it is demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.406" offset="10304972">Now if the plenary action which is said to be the remedy were brought, the trustee would have a right to pursue it either in the federal courts or in the state court; it would then be asserted, I take it, that there is some kind of a state court right under the Seventh Amendment which would be very oblique to a jury trial in which the state court has stated the there isn't one even not derivative from bankruptcy and in an ordinary state matter or it would have to be asserted that if the referee had made this choice, something pejorative in here did in choosing to use the state court has the jurisdictional for him where – where he has an absolute right under the federal statute so to do and where the Congress had the right under the constitutional provision to allow him so to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.255" offset="10544358">And if that is the argument that would be made then you get that – that to be exact that there is a kind to be logic implicit in arguing that allowing the – the trustee to assert a counterclaim when he as himself sued, which counterclaim is merely the basis on which he might have started a suit is a detriment to the person who made an election to go in and sue the referee by filing -- I mean sue the trustee by filing a claim.</text>
