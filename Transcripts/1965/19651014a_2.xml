            <text syncTime="69.919" offset="383039">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.678" offset="398085">This is a moonshine case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.427" offset="409057">It's the second installment, really a sort of stepchild of the Gainey case decided last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.173" offset="444061">Here as in that case, the issue is whether certain so called statutory presumptions, which were added to the Alcohol Tax Chapter of the Internal Revenue Code in 1958, are sufficiently rational to satisfy the test of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.925" offset="523055">The statutes involved here are printed at the front of our brief and of course, I will come to them later.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.574" offset="553671">I should like first to say something briefly about the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.424" offset="573106">The moonshine operation here, unlike Gainey, was in an otherwise vacant dilapidated warehouse building, part of a large industrial complex, on the edge of Jewett City, Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.824" offset="642696">The complex itself comprising some 42 acres was surrounded on three sides by a fence, on the other side by a river.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.371" offset="680835">At the time of the raid, which led to this case, the building was locked, most of the windows were obscured.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.890" offset="710928">The agents who had obtained a warrant had to force their way in breaking the lock.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.754" offset="738408">The agents found inside, what I'm told is a large illicit still operation, one that could produce almost 400 gallons of whiskey a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.652" offset="797968">There were also other evidence of the operation, including quantities of the distilled spirits and bags of sugar on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.571" offset="845615">The two petitioners before the Court now were found a few feet from the still.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.592" offset="873723">One of them said he had been three for three days that the still had been going all that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.444" offset="897128">The still was in full operation at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.141" offset="911966">On the person of the other petitioner were found keys to the building and to the gate and the fence, which surrounded the complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.321" offset="948642">Together with two others, the petitioners were brought to trial before a jury, and all those whose cases went to the jury were convicted on all charges against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.366" offset="1000887">All four, the two petitioners and two others, were convicted for conspiring to illegally produce distilled spirits and also for the substantive offense of producing spirits without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.676" offset="1062118">The petitioners and the petitioners alone were additionally charged and convicted with illegally possessing a unregistered still.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.528" offset="1101511">The petitioners were sentenced to concurrent jail sentences on all three counts, conspiracy to produce, production and possession, but in addition a fine was imposed as to each of the petitioners on the possession count.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.408" offset="1304952">Now as I will explain, the conspiracy convictions were affirmed by the Second Circuit, a petition from those affirmances was taken here and denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.125" offset="1359914">Therefore, those convictions are final, the three-year and two-year sentences imposed, one as to Ramona the other as to Ottiano on that count, the conspiracy count fully supports the sentence, identical concurrent sentence on the second count, which is produced.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.049" offset="1443610">Yes, on the other the Court of Appeals, perhaps unnecessarily, did reach the conviction on the second count and did hold unconstitutional the presumption involved in the second count applicable to the crime of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.509" offset="1521455">For that reason, we argue it, though we recognize that is not necessarily before this Court, that the Court is free to do as it did in Gainey and simply to reverse on the ground that the court below need not have reached the question and without this Court itself reaching the question, that is what the Court did in Gainey with respect to the possession count.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="397.591" offset="1693759">Now I may say even as to that, that the court below it had no occasion to reach it under its holding, might have avoided even a decision there had it thought the cumulative sentences were improper in the circumstances, thus eliminating the fine of the third count and leaving only sentences concurrent with the one count, which is finally affirmed and not open here.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.443" offset="1833148">In our view, very large in the background of this case, in controlling it in many respects, perhaps in most respects, is this Court's decision last term in Gainey.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.661" offset="1882049">As the Court would remember, in Gainey, you sustained the rationality and therefore the constitutionality of a statutory provision, a so called statutory presumption that authorized the jury to convict the person found at the site of a still whose presence was not satisfactorily explained by the evidence of illegally carrying on the business of a distiller.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.057" offset="1991555">The Court so concluded in light of two considerations, first the breadth of that substantive offense carrying on the business of a distiller, which the Court concluded included as principles that are under the aider and abettor statute, all persons connected in a business way with the illegal operation, that is the owner, the operator, his helpers, his suppliers, his distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.065" offset="2107643">The second consideration was the unlikelihood that anyone other than those mentioned would be found at the still in light of the isolated location of such stills, the traditional secrecy of moonshine operation and the policy of deterring a way of discouraging any stray person who might wander on to the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.058" offset="2223626">It may be important to note preliminarily, a possible distinction between Gainey and this case in that here, we have a city still whereas in Gainey we had a country still.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.204" offset="2284231">We think the distinction is unimportant and I must say that counsel for respondents does not make anything of it, but on its face one might suppose that here there was no isolation in the same sense as in Gainey and that ingredient of the Court's decision was lacking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.167" offset="2387989">However, in a different sense, there is equal inaccessibility to the still site here in the city as there in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.781" offset="2430516">It's not attributable to same factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.939" offset="2443160">We couldn't describe the premises here as an arcane spot, but on the other hand, the chances that an outsider would accidentally penetrate the compound is perhaps even less than in Gainey.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.975" offset="2495300">I need only to remind to the court that the building housing the still was firmly locked, but to approach it a curiosity seeker would have to penetrate a normally locked fence surrounding the entire complex, guarded by a watchman and it's certainly no one was likely to stumble on to this building most uninviting and dilapidated as it was by accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.639" offset="2617971">Now my opponent seems to suggest a reconsideration of Gainey recognizing its force in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.378" offset="2656841">I assume that, that decision rendered only last term is too recent to warrant by supposing that the Court would want to hear a re-argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.424" offset="2701040">Accordingly, I confine myself to building on Gainey without repeating the arguments made at that time to sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.992" offset="2743359">The issue here as I said is the constitutionality of two statutory presumptions quite comparable to that sustained in Gainey.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.538" offset="2781497">Here, they involve presumptions applicable to the Crime of Possessing a still and to the crime of producing distilled spirits without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.757" offset="2826428">Whereas in Gainey, the offense and the presumption applicable to it was carrying on the business of the distiller without a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.842" offset="2866761">In light of the Gainey ruling, the only real question here is whether these offenses, like the offense of carrying on the business involved in Gainey is also all comprehensive, so as to include everyone likely to be found at the site of the still.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.147" offset="2951920">If so, then the inference which the statute permits from presence at the site is rational and constitutional as it was in Gainey.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.438" offset="2993089">If the substantive offenses here on the contrary are much narrower, then we cannot sustain the rationality of the statutory presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.148" offset="3051917">Before discussing each of the substantive offenses here and their relative broadness, it may be important to say and to emphasize that the three crimes involved, the two here and the one in Gainey are not wholly overlapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.299" offset="3148570">If they were, that would tend to make nonsense out of the congressional scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.876" offset="3170826">It would be difficult to understand why Congress had written three provisions which in all circumstances covered the identical conduct by the same people.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.594" offset="3217742">Moreover if that was the fact, we would confront problems of election and accumulation of sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.601" offset="3249821">They are important differences between the three crimes, albeit we say they are all three broad crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.000" offset="3283362">The offense of possession of an unregistered still unlike the other two production and carrying on the business even expanded as we said was in 1958, probably encompasses only persons physically connected with the skill -- with the distill, whose proximity to the still is immediate.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.370" offset="3384822">That is clearly not true of the offense of carrying on the business nor is it true of the crime production.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.886" offset="3410944">Here the two the co-defendants who were not found at the still were convicted of producing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2459.956" offset="9943228">Doesn't he have to find that each of these accused were present in order to make the charge, because in the language of Gainey, he is not required to make the charge, I assume, if he doesn't make that finding of fact, but if he makes a finding of fact, what do we have the 12 people in the box for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.771" offset="10030477">The jury served no useful purpose or they were led to a conclusion by what I contend to be an erroneous charge, that violates the constitutional protections of each of these accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.252" offset="10088364">And in the language of the granting a certiorari in this case, I think the infection reached every defendant in the courtroom, that went to the jury, but that wasn't every defendant in this case, one of them was discharged at the end of the prosecutions case and one of them withdrew his plea of not guilty in the -- after about two or three days of trial and changed this plea to a lesser offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.605" offset="11109752">Well Your Honor, if there is going to be a determination that a criminal defendant in the Courts of the United States has a burden of ever going forward if he wishes to exercise his prerogative of silence that's a new position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.105" offset="11163773">I have never heard this Court reach that conclusion before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.289" offset="11176521">A man does exercise a risk if you find him with a smoking gun, somebody breaks into the room right after a loud rapport and there is a dead body on the ground and he is yelling “I killed him, I killed him” that is a pretty good inference that he killed him, but not, I contend, not sufficient inference so that you can compel him to take the witness stand and if doesn't do so, he does it at his peril, that's what these statutes do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.470" offset="11277249">They compel a man to take the witness stand regardless of what ancillary peril he maybe faced with and in the process he may very well prove “I wasn't in possession of this place, but I was at a place and at a time when they were selling some of the entrepreneur's product and that probably convicts him of some other subsection of 5601(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.605" offset="11373798">So when in exculpating himself from 5601(a)(8) which is the production statute, he probably convicts himself of some other subsection of 5601.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.876" offset="11418833">I contend gentlemen that the force of the Gainey decision if applied and I am frank to admit that I don't understand that the Gainey decision tells the trial judge that he doesn't have to charge under this statute, I think every prosecutor in this country is going to be in with a request a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.162" offset="11496051">It is going to quote the language of the statute and is going to say that statute has been sustained by United States and Gainey and the judge is going to charge on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.042" offset="11531577">He is going to read and if he doesn't, the prosecutor is going to say well, the United States and Gainey for example has been sustained, if United States and Romano were sustained, they are going to have two more that they can use and the prosecutor is going to stand up and say that Congress of the United States in its legislative wisdom has determined that you may find this defendant guilty if you find him on the premises, if you find as a fact that he was on the premises at a time when and at a place where distilled spirits were then and there being produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.241" offset="11652368">And if I understand the Wilson case from 1892, such a comment in any other criminal prosecution would be error, manifest error, but apparently for moonshiners that's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.554" offset="11717569">I respectfully submit to this Court that no matter how the Gainey decision is read, when it is applied to the facts in the Romano case, its major premise fails in that Romano case did not involve a still out in the country side surrounded by trees and foliage, it wasn't the biggest plant in town with three other companies at least doing business on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.560" offset="11833657">And insofar as keeping the public away, I can respectfully suggest that the public was never kept away from the premises, because one afternoon I drove out and took a look at the place and I -- the place was wide open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.612" offset="11877857">It apparently is wide open six days a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.014" offset="11887470">From the testimony in this case, I respectfully submit that there is error, that this Court ought to reverse the findings.</text>
