            <text syncTime="15.444" offset="166201">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.695" offset="183129">This case is a case which arose in the San Fernando Valley, County of Los Angeles wherein the defendant was driving an automobile somewhere in the neighborhood of midnight and struck a tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.235" offset="257317">The defendant actually -- or the petitioner denied the fact that he was driving a car, but it was held that he had in fact then driving the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.976" offset="284275">Sometimes subsequent to the petitioner exiting from the car, two police officers arrived at the scene -- one of them observed the petitioner standing by an ambulance and then the petitioner was placed in the ambulance and transported to a hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.835" offset="355746">At the hospital, the officer who had observed the petitioner at the scene, inquired of the passenger of the car and talked with the petitioner and asked the petitioner whether or not he would be willing to take a breathalyzer test to which the petitioner said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.682" offset="463161">The officer asked him whether or no he would be willing to take a blood test, according to the officer, the petitioner said yes and the officer went out to obtain a doctor and a nurse.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.669" offset="519064">But when the doctor and the nurse returned, the petitioner then stated no, he would not take a blood test because his attorney had told him not to submit to such a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.107" offset="572876">The petitioner in his testimony or in his affidavit indicated that he always refused to take the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.295" offset="601610">But, be that as it may, the officer then went out, spoke to his superior officer who apparently directed him to proceed with the test anyway, and the officer advised the doctor to proceed and to extract blood from the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.706" offset="679246">The blood was taken and the Los Angeles police officer chemist ran an analysis on the blood test or blood, and arrived at a reading of 0.18 which the chemist testified to would indicate that a person was at the alcohol reading -- at the time, he would be under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.344" offset="813725">And also though in the affidavit of the defendant, if this may become an issue as far as Your Honor is concerned, the fact is that the defendant had a broken leg or ankle and one fractured rib and was -- and have various lacerations on his body and he told the police, “I won't fight with you but I don't want you to take test in essence.”</text>

            <text syncTime="956.724" offset="3931282">I think that in reading Frankfurter's decision in Rochin, we can observe that he discussed interpreting constitutional phrases and he said that some of the phrases have been fixed by a gloss, which is a phrase I think he used, and that we are in effect held to this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.586" offset="4046744">But that in cases where the constitutional provision, and I think such as due process and fixed with a permanent gloss, that we must look at and he said, “When the gloss has thus not been fixed but is a function of the process of judgment, the judgment is bound to fall differently at different times and differently at the same time through different judges.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.880" offset="4131903">And this to me is more of a proper and correct analysis of the Rochin case, and to say that -- to violate due process as far as the state is concerned, one must physically and brutally take the evidence from the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.089" offset="4204732">As I indicated I think in my brief, if this individual, Schmerber, had fought with the officer with his broken leg and his fractured rib and his sutured mouth, number one, I would say it would have been painful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.249" offset="4381424">Then logically, wouldn't I have to return to California or to any state in effect and say to a client that, that you're not entitled to due process under our constitution unless you fight for your rights and possibly shed blood one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.986" offset="4472330">It -- to me, it doesn't seem logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.522" offset="4486437">And where is the point of no return on the insertion of the needle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.398" offset="4517992">For example, is the mere insertion of the needle into the arm, we say, “That's all right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.793" offset="4543592">What if the individual withdraws the arm as we've done in Duroncelay, People versus Duroncelay where the Court said that was a reasonable search in California and that that was okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.195" offset="4589150">But what if he withdrew it three times?</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.430" offset="4598136">Would it take three times for the withdrawal and the insertion of the needle before this Court would then say, “Well now this -- this is a violation of due process because it's not fair to have been stuck three times.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.136" offset="4644948">I don't think that distinction is a logical distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.627" offset="4658949">I think it must -- will fall more definitely and basically that the insertion of a needle into the body, the performance of the surgery on an individual constitutes the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.677" offset="4703148">Or otherwise, I think we'll then have to resort to the premise that he's taken -- withdraw blood from the body which the blood is in contraband, it belongs to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.475" offset="4746303">It's not like a narcotic -- it's his own blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.133" offset="4764902">It's not a gun that was used in a burglary or a robbery which is out in the exterior of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.040" offset="4788517">It's something which is his.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.851" offset="4799801">Then why can't the state, if we conclude that due process doesn't prohibit this, why can't a state then insert a needle and inject Nalline into any individual who was arrested and who appears to be either one under the influence of intoxicating beverages or a narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.114" offset="4884856">They'll take out so many cc's of blood and stick in so many cc's of Nalline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.201" offset="4909202">I think it follows if this Court holds that it's proper to withdraw the blood that is certainly just as proper to inject the Nalline if we're looking at the welfare of society and how we want to keep narcotic users off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.222" offset="4981300">So, I feel that this Court in determining the issue really should conclude that the Due Process Clause does prohibit the invasion of the body in this manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1656.787" offset="6731504">And the other point of course is the fact that a search and seizure made after a lawful arrest, and I'm not arguing the lawfulness of the arrest, search and seizure must be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.338" offset="6781764">Again, I say that I don't see how a puncturing of the skin or an entry into the body can be deemed reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.294" offset="6841532">But the entry into his body, I submit, is not reasonable and I think that both the Fifth and Fourth really run together here when we talk about search and seizure and about self-incrimination, that they run together here, and result in a conclusion that it's improper to make this type of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.295" offset="6929617">And additionally, whether or not the Court really feels this point as important that -- it's a point that's raised so frequently in California, giving the instruction to the jury that they can consider the fact that the defendant refused to give breath test or a blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.695" offset="6999207">I think, if the Court decides that the individual has the constitutional right to refuse, for example the blood test, that then it is improper and a violation of Griffin versus California to enable the Court to comment to the jury on it and enable the jury to draw a conclusion from that fact.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward L. Davenport</label>
            <text syncTime="1756.187" offset="7129192">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.900" offset="7144030">The counsel's argument says he does not contest the reasonable -- the fact that the grounds for a search was a reasonable probable cause for the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.763" offset="7175481">It's our contention that the incident to a lawful arrest to police officers may make a reasonable search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.940" offset="7200141">The Court in this case ruled that the taking of blood was such a reasonable search incident to a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.891" offset="7227935">Now, a little bit more on the facts, the facts of this particular case were that this man had involved in extremely serious accident, had driven across the wrong side of the road gone -- probably had to go with the double line to get that wrong side of the road because the double line continues down through the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.718" offset="7299302">He went up over the curve across a parkway, severed a 12-inch tree trunk, 12 inches in diameter -- excuse me Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.816" offset="7335664">And that he then continued on through a chain-link fence and ended up parked on the front of someone's lawn facing the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.851" offset="7367847">From these facts, the officer could tell that the man had been going north bound and had driven across the wrong side of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.392" offset="7393970">With such force, according to the evidence and according to the photos submitted by the defense, the car was completely destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.699" offset="7419152">The time the officers arrived, the other passenger was injured and the defendant indicated that he was at the scene and had some injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.539" offset="7446528">The officer at that time smelled alcohol in this person, saw his eyes were glassy, watery, bloodshot, he was staggering around the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.865" offset="7479860">The officer had a conversation at the scene indicating that this defendant was driving the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.273" offset="7497519">He continued onto the receiving hospital at which time he had a conversation with the passenger, which indicated that the defendant was driving the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.872" offset="7527926">From his observations at the receiving hospital, he determined that the man, in his opinion, was under the influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.180" offset="7557078">From those facts, there was a conversation and he asked the man to take the breathalyzer test, he refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.393" offset="7585917">He then asked him to submit to a blood test which the officer said he agreed to take at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.677" offset="7611099">Now, the counsel refers to an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.115" offset="7620817">Now the people did not -- prior to the submission of the affidavit, prior to the starting of the trial, we did not refute the affidavit for purposes argument on that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.885" offset="7663971">The Court continued its ruling into the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.772" offset="7671495">At the time of trial of course, we prove that that was in fact not the case, the defendant, in no time, in his testimony, ever mentioned anything about the blood test other than to say he didn't take it and he had no other conversations to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.196" offset="7725202">Counsel also refers to a broken ankle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.710" offset="7739204">The P -- or Defense G, the hospital record indicates the man did not have a broken ankle but a sprained ankle with a contusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.485" offset="7774312">At least, at the time at the hospital, the officer asked him and he said he agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.024" offset="7792494">The officer then obtained a doctor, an M.D. licensed in the State of California practice who prepared to take the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.580" offset="7818721">At that time, he withdrew his arm and said that my attorney has told me not to take these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.448" offset="7838156">The officer explained to him, we will note for the record that you have objected and therefore, we'll use -- and that point, the defendants -- under those circumstances, I will submit, no one held the arm when the arm test was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.629" offset="7890923">Now we submit that taking of blood sample on a medically approved manner does not offend the such “sense of justice” as referred to in the Brown versus Mississippi or does constitute brutal or “shock the conscience,” deprived the person -- the petitioner of due process under the Rochin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.908" offset="7956020">Now, in this case, as distinguished from Rochin there was no force at all used on the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.679" offset="7979112">There's no question he objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.392" offset="7989979">The -- our contention --</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward L. Davenport</label>
            <text syncTime="1988.088" offset="8056748">There is a quote to that effect in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.833" offset="8063749">But I think that that's just goes back to the fact that we derived our system of justice from England rather than the -- I don't think that fact is material to the determination of the case, one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.359" offset="8117875">The point and I think that our -- as we see the case, we submit that Breithaupt versus Abram should still be the law of this Court in view of the later decision of Mapp versus Ohio, Malloy versus Hogan, and Escobedo versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.494" offset="8174404">We feel that the importance -- the question to be determined, we have the officers have a right to make a reasonable search of the person at the time of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.495" offset="8214424">We feel that the questions is -- one of the reasons of this search and we submit that the taking of blood test is not, in the least, unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.243" offset="8249323">At the time -- shortly after Breithaupt, California came down with the case of People versus Duroncelay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.109" offset="8272833">At that time, California had already accepted the exclusionary rule prior to Mapp and the People versus Cahan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.549" offset="8302613">And the Court at that time considered whether or not this was a reasonable search incident to a lawful arrest, and they determined it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.755" offset="8331452">And they went back and said, in one of these circumstances, it should be considered as to reasonableness, is of course the great incident of death or injury on our highways that they consider it caused by the use of alcohol and driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.295" offset="8389548">But it should be considered too that this test was -- extracting of blood was so common with no resulting injury to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.248" offset="8425388">There was so reliable to this effect, both to convict them and to exonerate, to show the true state of the individual at the time, which was in question, that this was in fact a reasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.038" offset="8468543">And I submit the blood test is a very minor deal with my own three-year-old daughter who submitted too last week without a whimper, so I see no shocking or the community standards about that sort of thing attest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.302" offset="8517653">That the importance of the blood test, its probity value has to be taken as soon as possible after the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.095" offset="8540745">But therefore, that any time, it has allowed it to diminish, the person, as you know sobers up against the burn of the alcohol, it does not have the probity value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.411" offset="8574077">But it is a reliable method, the testing, and the blood analysis, and chemical analysis -- it has been upheld by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.798" offset="8603544">But I would say in California under -- in a case law, to deny an individual arrested for a charge involving intoxication, to make a phone call for his own doctor to take a test, is a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.623" offset="8654848">For the police at any time to interfere with the man after he's released is denial of due process and no government agency can do anything to interfere with this taking of blood test even though he may be inquiring at a city-owned hospital, they have a duty to give him that blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.385" offset="8713885">So I therefore say that this is merely the taking of real evidence which will prove the issue of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.595" offset="8734783">The question of reasonableness warrants for each case, we cannot take and conjure up hypotheticals, which a situation be unreasonable, we are limited to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.463" offset="8786296">Under the facts of this case, the search incident to a lawful arrest, the taking of blood was in all certainly reasonable, it had no brutal force, it didn't upset the community standards, this is something that is readily accepted by them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.283" offset="8997575">In the Duroncelay case, the man resisted to some extent of trying to move his arm away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.835" offset="9019726">They held his arm and the blood was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.771" offset="9027459">The Court said that that was not a violation of the Rochin rule, the brutal force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.079" offset="9052745">The question becomes one of -- when you use excessive force and that point re-arises, then that is no longer reasonable search and no longer a reasonable seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.724" offset="9087331">I submit, as counsel said, that we are not about to take a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.305" offset="9101646">In fact in our policy in Los Angeles, we do not take blood test under any -- if there was any resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.754" offset="9123380">We are not going to approach the Rochin rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.163" offset="9133098">But as a matter of law, I think that is -- the question determined in each case is whether or not the taking was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.402" offset="9153996">The man as I say in Duroncelay merely tries to pull his arm away.</text>
