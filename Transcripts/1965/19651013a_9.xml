            <label>Mr. William J. Condon</label>
            <text syncTime="35.245" offset="244381">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.472" offset="261308">This action comes here from the dismissal by a three-judge statutory court in the the Second Circuit, Common District of New York of a challenge by appellants to the constitutionality of a statue of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.689" offset="334137">The appellants Swift and Armour packed frozen stuffed turkeys in their plants in Wisconsin and Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.929" offset="367052">These are packed under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture, under the Poultry Products Inspection Act and they're shipped in interstate commerce from those plants to the various states of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.122" offset="423894">State of New York has a statute as part of the Agriculture Markets Law regulating net weights and the labeling thereof, which provides as applied and agreed in the Court below as proper, requires that a product such as stuffed turkey be labeled to show the net weight of the turkey and the net weight of the total product.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.297" offset="532564">Appellants labeled their turkeys with just the net weight of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.717" offset="554193">These labels are subject to the prior approval of the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States under the Poultry Products Inspection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.602" offset="593795">Each has an approved label showing just a single weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.419" offset="617096">In the early part of 1963, each appellant separately filed an application with the Department of Agriculture, requesting approval for a label, which would show separately the weight of the turkey, the weight of the stuffing and the total weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.895" offset="706957">These labels were rejected by the poultry division, I say rejected, actually the application came back commented on only, there is testimony of the trial indicate that this is the form in which a rejection takes at the Department of Agriculture level.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.410" offset="785011">And following the rejection of those labels, this lawsuit was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.123" offset="811865">Appellants challenged the constitutionality of the New York Statute on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.704" offset="846137">The first ground is that of violation of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution alleging both preemption and conflict for the Federal Statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.907" offset="895039">A violation of the Commerce Clause and interferences with the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.480" offset="933282">Now three-judge court was convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.468" offset="949269">Testimony was heard and at the conclusion thereof an opinion was written dismissing the complaint, it was unanimous opinion by the three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.956" offset="999215">At the outset I think it's necessary to discuss the question here of jurisdiction of this Court, the District Court expressed the view in its opinion that it seriously questioned whether this was properly a matter for three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.662" offset="1074030">Of course it follows from that, but there would be some question whether it was properly a matter for direct appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.888" offset="1102973">The Court of the view that if the problem involved only that of supremacy, that prior to this Court's decision in Kesler in any event, the District Court would have held without any problem that it was not a three judge matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.550" offset="1189595">That Section 2281 of Title 28 of three-judge statute would not apply to those circumstances and of course the Court noted however that in the Kesler situation, Mr. Justice Frankfurter writing for the Court indicated that where the conflict between the state and federal statute is immediately apparent without any serious necessity for the Court to construe statutes in order to get to the constitutional problem, that in that circumstance, Section 2281 ought to apply, the Court -- Judge Friendly speaking for the Court below noted however that in the Kesler situation it was necessary for Mr. Justice Frankfurter after making this statement to do a considerable amount of statutory construction both of the Federal Act and the State Act involved and he therefore concluded that the question before him, that is the three-judge court was whether or not this Court had been required to do more statutory construction than had been required in Kesler and then the Court rather neatly side stepped the problem by reference to the lack of sensitivity of its witness paper in suggesting that we appeal to both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court in the event that his determination or suggestion might be wrong at least no serious damage would have been done for the litigates.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.478" offset="1581328">This we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.155" offset="1595956">Now looking first at Kesler, I believe that there isn't any more certainly and I believe less statutory construction necessary here than was necessary in Kesler.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.098" offset="1663770">In that case you may recall that it was necessary for the Court to determine not only the meaning and policy of the Utah Financial Responsibility Act, but also a considerable amount of effort and attention was paid to the policy of the Federal Bankruptcy Act and indeed as I recall it, the dissenting justices didn't agree on the construction of either one exactly with that of the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.997" offset="1763349">So that there were serious questions of construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.773" offset="1778500">Here there is no problem with respect to the construction of the New York Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.373" offset="1800861">There hasn't been any question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.102" offset="1811832">We didn't challenge the interpretation of the New York Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.165" offset="1828028">There hasn't been any indication in the case or in the Court's opinion that, that was problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.290" offset="1852583">The Court simply indicates that this is the way that Act is applied and it's a perfectly reasonable construction of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.194" offset="1880168">There wasn't any problem involved with respect to the Poultry Products Inspection Act to be sure it had to be looked at, it had to be studied, but no serious problems was presented by way of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.359" offset="1940773">There is some and I do disagree to a large extent with some of the things that the Court did, but overall in the opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter took some 20 pages to dispose of the problems of construing the two statues in Kesler, it seems to me that in this case we haven't got anything worse than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.563" offset="2021648">We don't have more.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.107" offset="2151842">That was Mr. Justice Whitaker's opinion, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.102" offset="2163754">In that case it came here on the pleadings and there was a division in the Court and this very problem of what's the effect of a challenge to the constitution on supremacy ground was before the Court, but both majority and dissenting justices approached the problem on the basis that the determination of this issue rests upon the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.960" offset="2267199">It rests on the issues that are raised in the pleadings, not on the determination of the three-judge court after it has heard the evidence and decided whether or not the issues raised were properly proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.310" offset="2324564">This is the problem here, from the standpoint of the determination originally made by the district judge to whom the motion was addressed, the three-judge court and Judge Friendly notes in his opinion that Judge Coket at that time couldn't know that the other constitutional issues after proof would prove to be insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.706" offset="2434173">But in the Jacobson case both Mr. Justice Whitaker and Mr. Justice Frankfurter realized that or at least seemed to recognize that the problem of jurisdiction is determined upon the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.145" offset="2479940">This is what is presented to the Court and if the district court may enjoin the conduct complained of or enjoin the statute or declare unconstitutional, then that three judge court is necessary and a proper court.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.302" offset="2572622">We do and that has been held in abeyance at the Court of Appeal pending the determination of the jurisdictional question in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.661" offset="2638033">If I may turn to the merits of the controversy, the appellants' claim here that with respect to the problem involved in this case, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, has preempted occupied the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.906" offset="2735000">Now, there have been of course a line of preemption problems and cases before this Court almost throughout its entire history.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.315" offset="2776586">We could quote the language of the various formulas that have been relied upon, but basically it seems that in every instance where the problem before the Court is one of Federal preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.292" offset="2844505">What the Court is concerned with is the determination basically of the Federal Policy and whether or not the coexistence of state action in the areas involved would frustrate that Federal Policy or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.249" offset="2924335">What's the Federal Policy we're dealing with here?</text>
            <text syncTime="707.074" offset="2931649">First of all I think we ought to point this out, that the problem involved in this case is one of labeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.029" offset="2967489">The only thing that's involved is what is to go on a label.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.742" offset="2986297">There has been consideration, there has been discussion at various levels and there were some in Judge Friendly's opinion that the issue is one of a definition of net weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.416" offset="3037080">The appellants disagree with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.782" offset="3042513">I don't think this is the issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.558" offset="3049618">There never was any problem about what net weight means.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.324" offset="3068635">Net weight isn't defined they say in the Poultry Products Inspection Act, oddly enough it's not defined in the Agriculture and Markets Law in the State of New York either, which whole purpose is net weight, that's what it's regulating, it doesn't define it either.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.499" offset="3129344">This is not by way of criticism; it's just the fact that net weight isn't a problem to anybody who is concerned with weights.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.605" offset="3161840">We have gross, tare and net, the people know what they mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.899" offset="3178977">What's involved here is what net weight is to appear on the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.894" offset="3198934">How are we going to label the product and what is involved simply from the standpoint of this Federal supremacy question is whether or not Congress in the Poultry Products Inspection Act has preempted the field of what is to appear on a label of a poultry product which is subject to this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.455" offset="3845204">The way I distinguish is this, that are cases, we know cases for example the Campbell against Hussey situation, the Tobacco Inspection cases, tobacco labeling, where they -- the holding is that when Congress has acted then there is no room for state action, you find this in the Interstate Commerce cases too.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.176" offset="3944051">The issue I think was argued here yesterday in connection with the National Labor Relations Act as well that can the two coexist even though they touch different things, even if they don't conflict with one another?</text>

            <text syncTime="976.507" offset="4009357">On the other hand, even though the two may coexist, take for example the Savage and Jones and McDermott and Wisconsin situation, where in Savage and Jones, the Court held that there maybe state regulation of labeling even though the Food and Drugs Act had something to do with labeling at that time, but then the McDermott situation came along and said yes there maybe state action, but not if it conflicts with the action of Congress with the federal action and this is where I am separating, this is how I developed the dichotomy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.295" offset="4544554">I think we have to define it from what Congress has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.808" offset="4562631">This is what -- this is the problem that comes to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.176" offset="4572035">In this kind of a situation you look at what Congress has done and you try to determine whether or not any other holding would be consistent with the Congressional policy, whether they can consistently do what they try to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.548" offset="4649566">In this statute, the policy of the Act, I think with respect to this aspect can be defined from a look at what the Congress has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.299" offset="4704528">The definition section, for example, where they define immediate containers and it's clear that this Act applies to immediate containers and an immediate container is defined to include a consumer package and that's what we're talking about in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.050" offset="4763564">We're talking about a turkey that's wrapped up in a package that's going to the consumer and Congress defines that in here, has some reason for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.823" offset="4806614">It provides for prior approval of labels by the Secretary of Agriculture and specifically for the prior approval of labels, which are going on consumer packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.376" offset="4856874">Now, Congress has said this, the regulations say this, they make it plain, that before we may use a label on any poultry product subject to this Act, we must first submit it and incidentally the regulations are very plain, we are not allowed to print it until after it's been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.015" offset="4947466">The Secretary of Agriculture must approve the label and this label must be on the product before we can ship it out of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.300" offset="5024580">As a matter of fact the Act, see what the Court and what Congress has done in the statute, that at the heart of it there are all kinds of regulatory provisions but the heart of the statute is contained in Section 6, 7, and 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.300" offset="5112560">Section 6 provides for the inspection of the product, Section 7 provides for the sanitary facilities and the practices, Section 8 for labeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.396" offset="5152998">Congress takes up the three of them with no differentiation, no distinction, there is no categorization or weight attached to one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.308" offset="5192600">Now the argument is made that it's clear from the declaration to policy on the legislative findings of Congress Sections 3 and 2 in the inverse order, so all Congress was concerned with was on unwholesome poultry and the desire not to have unwholesome poultry moving in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.908" offset="5282983">Well, this maybe so, this is what Congress has said, this is their policy, it's what they are trying to do, is control the interstate shipment of poultry, so that they won't have unwholesome poultry moving in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.764" offset="5342438">Now then, that's what they intend to by this statute and then they sat down and wrote the statute and they wrote in Section 6, in order to effectuate these policies we are going to have anti and postmortem inspection of the products of the plant, they wrote in Section 7 what they are going to do with respect to sanitary facilities and they wrote in Section 8 what they require with respect to labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.816" offset="5446614">Now it is a legislative certainly not a judicial determination whether or not the means which Congress has adopted in the statute are the best or the most appropriate means of effectuating the purposes announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.900" offset="5507009">But the fact is however that this is what Congress has done in order to effectuate the purposes described in the beginning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.202" offset="5548178">Now I know that the Solicitor General has filed a brief as amicus curiae and has taken the position that this statute does not preempt the field and in his brief the Solicitor General on the page 19, quotes with rather substantial ellipsis from the – one of the house reports, when he says that net weight labels was merely intended to “Ellipsis”, round out, the Acts' principle purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.715" offset="5738245">On the page 33 of the appellant's brief, the same quote appears only without quite so much of an ellipsis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.981" offset="5787251">At the very bottom of the page, moving over on to the second page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.121" offset="5807835">If the purpose is to establish a system of compulsory inspection poultry and poultry products in interstate commerce, moving down the last sentence, such inspection would be rounded out by requirements as to the maintains of sanitary facilities and the practices, and as to correct an informative labeling in products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.237" offset="5896338">Now I presume that the Solicitor General doesn't intend us to conclude from this that the maintenance of sanitary facilities and practices is as incidental to the wholesomeness and therefore the furtherance of the congressional polices as is that net weight labeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.045" offset="5983587">The fact of the matter is that Congress has chosen to regulate all three areas in order to establish -- develop its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.691" offset="6034160">It's not then for the Court to say whether this was appropriate or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.125" offset="6131858">Before I leave this question of preemption, I'd like to refer again to an argument raised by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.491" offset="6185357">Because Solicitor General in his brief makes reference to the exemption from the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which that Act contains for products subject to the Meat Inspection Act and the substantially identical language which appears in the Poultry Products Inspection Act in 19A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.877" offset="6286921">The argument runs that under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act this Court has always held that the state is free to regulate with respect to labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.573" offset="6349615">It follows and any such case under the Meat -- under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which involved federal inspected meat, the Cockman case and he moves from there to indicate that if the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies to poultry, since the exempt to meat, since the exemptions are same under the poultry, then likewise it would apply to poultry after the interstate shipment has concluded and that being so, then obviously the states may do what they want after the interstate shipment is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.898" offset="6482944">And I call the attention of Court the argument for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.339" offset="6504678">The first is that I think the statement originally that this Court has consistently held that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act did not prevent state action is a grutalative statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.665" offset="6558072">That the cases cited in support of that proposition are all cases involving the Food and Drugs Act of 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.029" offset="6587538">So far as I know this question hasn't been presented to this Court with respect to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.596" offset="6617736">Now this has not suggested necessarily the Court would reach a different result, but it is to suggest that it need not necessarily reach the same result because the labeling provisions and requirements under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 are substantially more detailed and more stringent and in many areas perhaps preemptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.823" offset="6706657">Certainly I think this must be true with respective prescription drugs and things of that sort, but in any event the cases don't support the principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.270" offset="6740407">This is the basis for this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.470" offset="6753259">The second leg of the argument I believe is the Cockman case and as I say that was a prosecution with criminal case, the prosecution for removing labels from federally inspected meat after the shipment in interstate commerce was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.570" offset="6817625">With respect to that case, I can only say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.920" offset="6831104">In the Court of Appeals opinion the question of the exemption from the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was never raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.351" offset="6860779">The Court of Appeals doesn't discuss it and in the petition for certiorari which was filed with this Court, the petitioner doesn't raise it either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.085" offset="6903724">Now the case certainly is something less than authority for the proposition that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act applies immediately to meat products when their interstate movement is through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.465" offset="6965269">And finally its the language of the exemption as written into the statute, Section 19(a) is that secretary's authority should be exclusive in poultry and poultry products should be exempt from the provisions of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended to the extent of the application or the extension thereto, of the provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.215" offset="7076237">Well then it begs the question, and question is how far does this Act extend and if this Act as I contend does extend in the case of consumer packages which are regulated in the statue, which are prescribed as to their labeling in the statute and the regulations and for which the labels must be approved by the sectary before they can be put on the product and if as I contend this Act carries to the consumer with respect to that label, then it begs the question to say that, this exemption is the same as for meat, because it is as far as the exemption is concerned, but certainly that doesn't define the extension of this Act, to determine where the exemption begins and ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.468" offset="7301204">The other half of the supremacy argument, the one which gave everybody so much trouble and certainly did the Court below and that's the question of the conflict with the Federal Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.682" offset="7350105">I don't think there is much very much doubt that factually we have a conflict as of the moment we have a product with a label which is approved by the Department of Agriculture, which we sell everywhere in the United States except the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.440" offset="7429099">That product cannot come into New York with that label on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.207" offset="7584162">So the question really comes what do we have to put on the product in Minnesota?</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.648" offset="7601925">Now New York says we have to put on that product in Minnesota two weights, weight of the turkey, the weight of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.543" offset="7629511">Department of Agriculture has turned down our application for a label, which would satisfy New York requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.148" offset="7667963">And this raises the question now of -- two questions really, the Court below indicated first of all that we could use a supplemental label.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.899" offset="7711013">And this way everybody would be happy, but there are one or two things wrong with that, first of all I think that the Court below unduly restricted the definition of label in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.756" offset="7762422">As the label as you know and this Poultry Products Inspection Act is defined to include both the definition of label and the definition of labeling from the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.942" offset="7803173">They were lifted banally and made into one definition and that's any written, printed or graphic material on the product, on the label or accompanying such product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.820" offset="7850611">Now this Court has already defined what accompanying such product means as those words were used in the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.237" offset="7884361">In the Cardell case, you may recall Cardell against the United States, a criminal prosecution for misbranding a product when introduced into interstate commerce, 301 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, and this Court held that, that product was misbranded when the misrepresentation, the false misleading material followed the product in interstate commerce by as much as 18 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.308" offset="7984567">So that there isn't any way really that we can have additional information to go with the turkey even if it were physically possible to do it and practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.615" offset="8037857">There isn't anyway we could do it without it being part of the label and therefore subject to the prior approval of the Secretary of Agriculture.</text>

            <text syncTime="4027.100" offset="16211780">We are interested in getting a decision on the merits by this Court, but nevertheless in view of the expression of opinion and the opinion of the District Court about the jurisdictional point, we thought it necessary to brief the point in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.151" offset="16308015">Under Section 1253 of the code, this case can be heard by -- on a direct appeal only when a three-judge court is required to hear the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.182" offset="16376142">Under the doctrine of preemption, this raises no direct constitutional question and there would be no requirement for a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.188" offset="16424103">On the question of conflict, in this case it becomes apparent, both statutes are identical in language, both say net weight and in an order to attack the application or the practices of New York State, it was necessary for the appellants to have the court construe the interpretation by the Commissioner of Agriculture of the State of New York under a regulation issued by him pursuant to that Section 193 of the Agriculture Markets Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.674" offset="16582092">So you have two ways being moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.264" offset="16588466">First you have the statute, which has the identical language that the federal statute has, net weight, then you have a regulation issued by the Commissioner of Agriculture of the State of New York, which defines the net weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.666" offset="16654085">Then you have an interpretation by the Commissioner of Agriculture following that regulation which actually is the point in controversy here that brings the case into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.738" offset="16702360">And as we read the Kesler case, this was not a case for a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.073" offset="16747708">The particular phraseology in the Kesler case was, if an immediate controversy is not the unconstitutionality of a states statute, but merely the construction of a state law or the federal law, the three-judge requirement does not become operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.761" offset="16826389">And here as I said the situation falls directly within the language which I have quoted from the Kesler case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.085" offset="16871737">Now in addition to the attack on the statute under the Supremacy Clause, there were claims raised in the complaint under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause, and we made a motion to dismiss on the ground those claims were insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.454" offset="16957210">The court as you see from the opinion held that the claims were unsubstantial and we say therefore that the fact that a three-judge court was actually convened and heard the case and ruled that the claims were unsubstantial, did not authorize the direct appeal to this Court because the cases have held that a single judge compares on the substantiality of the federal constitutional claims raised in the complaint, because otherwise any insubstantial claim could be made and entitle the pleader to a three judge court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4934.128" offset="19839875">There is no discussion at all in the committee reports about weight, except a single reference in the committee report in discussing Section 8 and merely making the statement that it contained a reference to quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.107" offset="19903822">It is claimed at the time net weight in Section 8 of the Act is indeed and beyond plausible dispute, a peripheral aspect of the Act, to which they dissenting opinion in the Florida Avocado case referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.494" offset="19985324">Appellants refer to Section 8(a) of the Act banning false or misleading matter on the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.280" offset="20016462">Nothing in that section of the Act excludes the state requirements of an additional truthful statement of the weight of the poultry as well as the total net weight required by the Federal Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.053" offset="20071633">On the contrary, the District Court found that the additional statement would make the impression conveyed by the total weight less misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.759" offset="20126386">Relevant also is language in Section 18(b) of the Act that in carrying out the provisions of this Act, the secretary may cooperate with state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.152" offset="20183960">In sum, it appears that there is absent here any intention to interfere with the particular state requirement, stemming from the state's regulation of weight measures, which as the opinion of the District court shows, goes back in New York to colonial times.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.009" offset="20267447">The official inspection mark on the poultry package required by Section 8 is simply inspected for wholesomeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.634" offset="20305899">I find no provision in the Act itself, requiring label approval by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.470" offset="20349262">The requirement for label approval is in the regulations and there is a section in the Act, which authorizes the Secretary to make regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.124" offset="20399835">Appellants, however, seek to buttress their claim by reference to these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.905" offset="20427003">The regulations don't change anything, the Act does not define net weight or other measure or its contents and neither does the regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5117.175" offset="20572035">The regulations do not strengthen any claim of preemption or furnish any support for any ruling that the statutory words in Section 8, "Net weight or other measure of its contents," exclude the furnishing of the additional information as to the weight of the poultry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.198" offset="20660120">The assertion by the appellants of long standing departmental interpretation of the Act's language as to net weight is not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.499" offset="20705364">It must be remembered that this Act was only enacted, the Federal Act was only enacted in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.199" offset="20736188">It appears in the record that quantity shipments of stuffed poultry by the appellants date from 1960.</text>

            <text syncTime="5312.155" offset="21351946">The poultry inspection division, this is the division which subsequently disapproved the label submitted by Armour and Swift, the poultry inspection division in the same period approved a label calling for the three weights, not two weights, three weights -- a statement of three weights submitted by the Connecticut fund for stuffed Cornish hens and the meat inspection unit of the Department of Agriculture at the same time, 1963, approved a label calling for Cornish hens which is also a combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.698" offset="21522160">And approving a label for Cornish hens, stuffed Cornish hens, the poultry unit said, “There would be no objection to showing the weights of the stuffing in the bird if they were shown separate from the net weight statement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.432" offset="21589138">So therefore, as I submit, the departmental history would appear to contradict the assertion in the brief of the appellants of a long standing policy of departmental interpretation of the term net weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.315" offset="21648593">Still more demonstrative of lack of any assistance in the regulations or in the departmental practice to the contention of preemption is the recognition by this very department, that additional state requirements are not displaced by the Federal Act and Regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5472.222" offset="21992260">The state requirement for additional information on a separate label as the appellant's have admitted, acting under the Food and Drug Act was upheld in Savage against Jones and the subsequent case, the Corn Products Refining case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.916" offset="22067075">In the Savage case, the opinion referred to the object of the Food and Drugs Act to prevent adulteration and misbranding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.110" offset="22107826">After discussing the Federal Acts language against false or misleading material the Court said it is one thing to make a false or misleading statement regarding the article or its ingredients and it maybe quite another to give no information as to what the ingredients are.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.915" offset="22187029">In the present case, the state as has been stated by the appellants would be satisfied as in the Savage case, by a supplementary label or even by a tag attached to the bird merely stating additionally the weight of the bird.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.300" offset="22288593">This would remove any possibility that this additional information was part of the Federal Inspection Mark or had secured federal approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.796" offset="22346585">Furthermore, this would not require tampering with or removing the federally approved label, which was the basis for decision in the McDermott case referred to by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.017" offset="22411473">After the McDermott case, this Court decided the Corn Products case to which I -- which I've just mentioned and the Court there specifically upheld the right to require additional information on a state label under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.792" offset="22482526">Incidentally the appellants in the Amicus Association questioned the validity of the commissioner's position that on authorizing this statement that a supplementary label or tag would comply with his interpretation of Section 193 of the New York State Agriculture Markets Law and they get into a discussion as to the validity of the interpretation under New York State Law, of the position of the Commissioner of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.437" offset="22601122">Judge Friendly in the three-judge opinion referred to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.645" offset="22617945">We originally in our answer invited him to seek a resolution to that question by going to the State Court first, but they declined the invitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.289" offset="22652531">At any rate, Judge Friendly held that the interpretation by the State Commissioner of Agriculture was a reasonable interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.639" offset="22697880">Appellants have referred during the course of this argument to the Cardell case, a case decided under the misbranding provisions of the Food and Drugs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5658.005" offset="22735391">Their statements and their brief that it's dispositive of the preemption point is in effect extravagant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.239" offset="22768306">Court -- the case simply held that the false statements in advertising accompanying the product was subject to prosecution under that section and the majority held that both were integral parts of the offering despite the time separation to which my friend referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.525" offset="22849494">Nothing in that case does anything to undercut the Savage and the Corn Products cases decided under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.686" offset="22906128">While it is not necessary for a decision here at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.284" offset="22924518">We should point out that there is no showing that the Appellants could not regulate their manufacturing process, so that the tag or label could in fact be added in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.189" offset="22964120">Several alternative suggestions present themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.943" offset="22979166">The weight of the poultry could be put on by an indelible stamp or the amount of stuffing regulated that was done by the shipper of stuffed Cornish hens who had an actual -- who monitored the amount of stuffing that went into the bird.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.814" offset="23058578">The principal reliance, in effect, by the appellants has been to this rejection of the label approval submitted first by Swift in the middle of 1963 and immediately disapproved by the department federal official and subsequently in the latter part of August as they were contemplating this lawsuit they had Armour &amp; Company also submit an application for label approval and cause it to be disapproved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.532" offset="23197550">And so let me make clear that the application submitted in each of these instances by Armour and by Swift were for approval of a label -- federal label containing the information requested by New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.893" offset="23278947">No application was ever submitted by the appellants to the Federal Department of Agriculture for approval of a supplementary label or a tag conforming with New York's requirements and there is no occasion to -- at this time to predict what the Department of Agriculture would do, formerly if such an application had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.791" offset="23378526">So that the argument that the disapproval by the lower echelon federal official establishes a conflict falls or fails because no application was actually ever submitted to the federal official complying with New York's requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.140" offset="23483956">Moreover, the application submitted by Swift &amp; Company had contained a provision calling for information as to three ways and New York has explained only requires one additional point of information, the weight of the poultry without the stuffing.</text>

            <text syncTime="6010.472" offset="24145272">But they did more than that and I think there was a lack of good faith, evident in these packers in not advising New York State and not advising officially the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Department of Agriculture of the interest of New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.721" offset="24206294">And their motive for it was they were just going through with the motions to prepare for this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.231" offset="24292289">And in the record appears admissions by the witnesses produced by these packers that they never made any tests in their packing plans to determine whether the additional information would present any manufacturing problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.776" offset="24374523">Nor did the department of agriculture direct any test to be made to see whether it was practicable to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6078.888" offset="24418931">When the application was denied the department, Federal Department of Agriculture, poultry inspection unit, used reasons which were established in the record in this Court by the testimony of the witnesses produced by the packers to be without any rational substance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6099.844" offset="24502732">One reason was it would lead to confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.826" offset="24518719">Second it said it might cause contamination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.937" offset="24535124">All these reasons were explained as having no substance because as I have already said, it appeared that it would take less than a half a minute to add this additional information and secure the net weight of the poultry and actually 30 or 40 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.554" offset="24621537">This turkey or poultry is in the manufacturing process at a room temperature about 40 degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.544" offset="24657586">So the fraction of a minute would have no deleterious affect at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.879" offset="24730937">The case here is somewhat unusual because of the fact that they were no adverse parties there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6162.355" offset="24752776">You had an administrator -- an application for approval to administrator by a person or a party who wanted the administrator to make the -- to disapprove the application and as counsel has said they were happy with the decision of the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="6186.192" offset="24848175">In such a situation, there is no true basis for a challenge to the constitutionality of the action of the state on the basis of this disapproval by the minor federal official.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.277" offset="24920482">As I've said, while this business was going on, at the very time this business was going on, the federal unit was in the impossible position of having to approve two weight statements for Cornish and stuffed poultry, where the experience was favorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.602" offset="24989759">The record shows the experience was favorable, that there had been no consumer complaints or confusion or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6229.071" offset="25019643">Nevertheless, when they were disapproving the application for label approval submitted by a Swift &amp; Company and not to be inconsistent, they abruptly withdrew the approval of the label of the Cornish hen, the stuffed Cornish hens.</text>
            <text syncTime="6251.306" offset="25108564">Furthermore the witness and the lower echelon official of the poultry inspection unit had conversations with the meat inspection unit, with the consequence, that in December 1963 at the commencement of this action that unit also caused the approval of the label for the Cornish hens to be withdrawn, indicating the special interest of this particular employee of the Department of Agriculture, which I said a little while ago should withstand scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="6294.011" offset="25279404">It is our argument that if the appellants desire to obtain a resolution of the assumed conflict, it was necessary for them to pursue the departmental review provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.493" offset="25329351">That the issue tended by them as to the alleged conflict was not right for judicial intervention and we have relied on our brief on the per curiam opinion, in Arkansas Power and Light Company and the opinion of this Court in Myers against Bethlehem, particularly the Arkansas case which we think is appropriate in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.407" offset="25420988">The District Court in its opinion phrased it this way: “When the inconsistency hinges on a factual determination, a citizen desiring freedom from state regulation does not discharge his burden by obtaining a letter from a subordinate federal official at least when Congress has laid out a fact finding procedure as to which the state could be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.928" offset="25543032">At such a hearing, it is quite unlikely, said Judge Friendly, "that anyone would reasonably find that a separate statement of the weight of the unstuffed bird would be false or misleading."</text>
            <text syncTime="6375.474" offset="25605308">We note that the Solicitor General not only agrees with our position as respects preemption and the other constitutional claims advanced by the appellants, but also agrees with the District Court's view just expressed and adds such additional arguments which are not contained in our brief as the public interest and a full development of the facts in which we fully join.</text>
            <text syncTime="6403.714" offset="25718262">The responsive appellants is indeed a confession and avoidance, a confession that they wanted and welcomed a disapproval by the subordinate federal official, and an attempt to show that New York was not entitled to notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6425.635" offset="25805928">When this law -- echelon official arbitrarily disposed of the matter and this is relied upon to ask for equitable relief against a state statute we submit the issue is in fact not ripe for such action until there is a complete factual record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.619" offset="25889834">Since appellants will not in fact advise parties to the disapproval, the factual record could not be made without New York and any other public interest properly given an opportunity to present such facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.125" offset="25975829">And as I said furthermore since as the District Court found that no application had been made for approval of the label material in accordance with New York requirements, the question of conflict does not really arise in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6484.225" offset="26040299">Appellants also relied upon the Commerce Clause and the District Court as I said held that the claim was insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6493.638" offset="26077915">Appellants concede the right of the states to protect its people from fraud and deception especially in the field of weights and measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6503.741" offset="26118353">The case of Savage against Jones to which I referred previously, the Plumley case, all of the cases cited by us in our brief reject the Commerce Clause argument advanced by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6517.910" offset="26174986">In the Euron case, this Court said that the Commerce Clause did not cut the states off from legislating under it's police power even though the legislation might indirectly affect commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.566" offset="26229635">The fact that out of state processes may be required to alter their processes in not unduly burdensome manner, as found by the District Court, there is no objection under the Commerce Clause to state regulation, especially as we have noted in the field of protection of the public in the area of weights and measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6558.000" offset="26335378">In the Florida Avocado case, this Court said that a state may impose upon imported food stuffs a higher standard demanded for its consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6570.138" offset="26383966">The contention by the appellants in the Amicus Association that other states may impose other requirements, supports no Commerce Clause argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6579.538" offset="26421478">The District Court found that there was nothing in the record to show that the appellants could not prepare for sale in New York, stuffed poultry in sufficient numbers to satisfy New York's requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6594.377" offset="26480828">As we have pointed out the Federal Act contains no mandate for uniformity in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6602.054" offset="26511548">Moreover, the possibility of contrary requirements banning the additional information in other states is as remote as laws banning compliance with requirements against discrimination referred to in the Colorado discrimination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.052" offset="26579571">We can't anticipate that any state would ban the particular information required by New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6630.016" offset="26623457">In any event, there is no proof of present conflict in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6635.052" offset="26643623">Finally in this connection, we have pointed out there is likewise no proof that New York's requirement could not be complied within New York itself at the point of sale by simply marking the poultry with an indelible mark, setting out the poultry's weight or by using the amount of stuffing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6656.713" offset="26730245">The Commerce Clause would not apply as held in the Armour against North Dakota case cited in our brief upon the principle that the Commerce Clause does not extend to interstate commerce after it comes to rest within the borders of New York state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6674.457" offset="26801194">Finally, the claims under the Fourteenth Amendment, the District Court said were baseless.</text>
            <text syncTime="6680.877" offset="26826898">Upon the record it was obvious that the state was legislating in a reasonable manner, in a traditional area involving the exercise of its police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6690.231" offset="26864306">The record showed that the proportions of stuffing in the bird could not be ascertained by the consumer in the absence of the information required by the New York interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6702.743" offset="26914356">The substantial variations of the stuffing in the stuffed turkey processed by the appellants and the consequent need for state action was fully established in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6717.396" offset="26972975">Furthermore there is no basis for any claim of discrimination, the requirement and the Commissioner's interpretation is binding upon both domestic and out of state processes of stuffed poultry equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="6733.818" offset="27038595">The failure to exclude TV dinners or a host of other ready-to-eat food products such as the pork and beans referred to by my adversary is on a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6748.989" offset="27099303">They are sold as units.</text>
            <text syncTime="6751.417" offset="27109021">Poultry, stuffed poultry and other poultry is sold by the pound, and of course the principle is, an accompanying principle that the state need not cover the whole area, they found the need for this particular type of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6769.784" offset="27182477">In the brief of the Amicus Association, they take a contrary position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6777.848" offset="27214764">They say that if the Court approves the interpretation of New York law by the Commissioner, a horrible result would attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="6789.864" offset="27262830">There would be chaos in the industry, because all these combination products would automatically become subject to the interpretation of the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6799.606" offset="27301804">Of course that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6801.536" offset="27309537">The regulation specifically excludes those types of combination products.</text>

            <text syncTime="6900.472" offset="27705240">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6901.249" offset="27708374">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6910.991" offset="27747349">There were one or two things that were opened by the Attorney General in his argument that may require at least mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6920.700" offset="27786219">One, the matter of the knowledge of the Department of Agriculture of the situation with respect to New York, as the Attorney General pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6931.297" offset="27828537">Mr. Howell who is Deputy Director of the poultry division testified on the subpoena by Swift &amp; Company in the criminal prosecution in New York City in November of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="6942.962" offset="27875244">He testified again at the trail of this action in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="6948.224" offset="27896247">Now I'm sure that we all know that no federal official in the department of this kind is going to come to New York in response to a subpoena without the knowledge, official knowledge of his department, that the subpoena isn't served and worked quite the same way on a federal official as it might someone else on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="6968.065" offset="27975659">The department did know and did know the problem and the approval was given to Mr. Howell to respond and testify on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="6979.035" offset="28019545">Somehow or other it appears that because the department didn't get in touch with New York, that the Department and particularly Mr. Howell was being partial, perhaps partial in the Swift &amp; Company or Armour and Company, I'm not sure which, but I think perhaps it ought to be mentioned that New York also was aware of the conflict and perhaps New York might have had some burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="7007.115" offset="28131871">There are after all 49 other states and perhaps New York might have had some question or some burden or responsibility of being in touch with the federal people.</text>
            <text syncTime="7017.348" offset="28172727">There is no indication that this was done either.</text>
            <text syncTime="7020.720" offset="28186206">Now, the point was made again finally that these other combination products to which the Poultry Institute brief refers are not covered by the New York law and this simply isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="7033.619" offset="28237824">As long as they are not ready to eat, and that means cooked, handed to you so that you can eat them now, if they are combinations of meat, poultry or sea food, they are covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7045.560" offset="28285576">This confusion existed on the record and it was clarified in the cross examination and again the redirect examination of Mr. Madden at his testimony in the trial he was the defendant's principal witness here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7064.298" offset="28360600">One other point: there was reference made to the material that appears on the bottom of the application form.</text>
            <text syncTime="7075.480" offset="28405321">This material was read and it says that this represents the attitude of this service only and does not excuse the compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7088.540" offset="28457566">Now the question is, I suppose what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="7092.428" offset="28473135">The only answer to that, I don't know what it means but in view of what's happened in this lawsuit, we have a pretty good idea of what it does not mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="7101.611" offset="28509811">It does not mean that the service having rejected your application is going to close its eyes if you try to put out a product with a label that doesn't comply with what they've done.</text>
            <text syncTime="7112.652" offset="28554010">Now, it might very well mean that the product can't be sold if it's adulterated and it might very well mean a number of other things, but it cannot mean that the service is turning its back on the mandate of Congress and not going to do what Congress has told them to do and that this doesn't mean what the congressional act obviously seems to say that it does.</text>

            <text syncTime="7134.882" offset="28642931">Mr. Condon, can I ask you this question?</text>
            <text syncTime="7138.818" offset="28658604">As I understand it the New York Statute and the Federal Statute are for present purposes about the same, that is to say the both require statement of net weight, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="7153.675" offset="28718059">Well, they both require a statement of net weight, I think the substantial difference is, the Federal Act calls for the net weight of the product, poultry product.</text>
            <text syncTime="7163.872" offset="28758810">It defines poultry product to be, poultry plus anything else is packed with it, food.</text>
            <text syncTime="7171.102" offset="28787754">The New York law requires net weight, but it defines net weight as being the net weight of the meat, poultry or sea food.</text>

            <text syncTime="7215.503" offset="28965386">Now suppose that the two statutes provided only generally, that there must be on the label a statement of net weight.</text>
