            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 940, Joseph A. Rinaldi, Appellant, versus Howard Yeager, Warden, et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.636" offset="145951">Mr. Lacey.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick B. Lacey</label>
            <text syncTime="14.434" offset="161102">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.589" offset="181687">Joseph Rinaldi, the appellant in this proceeding is presently confined in the New Jersey State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.772" offset="214497">He is there following conviction and following admittedly and frankly an exhaustion of not only the trial process but the appellate process afforded him by the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.862" offset="278862">To that extent, and I want to make this clear at the outset, we are not within the precise holding of Griffin and the cases which follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.116" offset="319822">In other words, we are not here contending that because of this financial obligation which I will point out later, he was asked to assume, he was impeded in having either due process with respect to his freedom at the trial level or due process with respect to his freedom at the appellate level.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.732" offset="418252">The position that I take here, however, is I believe a logical extension of what this Court has held in Griffin and the other cases which are cited in our brief such as Eskridge, Draper, Burns, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.374" offset="480841">Specifically, Rinaldi following conviction at trial applied under New Jersey procedures to be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis to appeal in the Appellate Division of the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.542" offset="541550">This procedure was pursued by him and he was permitted to so proceed in forma pauperis.2 (a) 152 Section 17 permitted this procedure and he availed himself of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.691" offset="606124">Our quarrel is not with 17 however but with the next section which is Section 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.722" offset="634232">18 we say, provided a means whereby New Jersey was permitted to utilize this carrot so to speak of appellate procedure to coerce Rinaldi into making an assignment of all of his institutional wages should he, following this gamble of whether to appeal or not, take the appeal and lose because Section 18 provides that if the applicant for proceeding in forma pauperis should have his conviction affirmed on appeal, then the cost of the trial transcript must be taken from all of his institutional wages until it is paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.767" offset="878425">We say that this constituted unlike Griffin which was of course a due process taking of liberty, but this constituted without due process, a taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.382" offset="952926">I think that in the overall in terms of the public interest and quite aside from a narrow question of Joseph Rinaldi, it flies in the face of what I believe was a clearly articulated philosophy of this Court that we don't want to do anything that will interfere with the thinking process as to whether or not an appeal should be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.590" offset="1049684">The history of the statute, that is the legislative history, is devoid of any assistance and there's nothing in the record to indicate what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.837" offset="1086673">However, the statute itself was a specific answer to this Court's holding in the Griffin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.525" offset="1121468">The Attorney General forthrightly concedes that one of the policy reasons behind the statute was to discourage frivolous appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.309" offset="1232645">And the Attorney General thus concede that one of the policy reasons for it Mr. Justice Brennan is to discourage non-meritorious appeals -- or frivolous appeals or non-meritorious appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.640" offset="1365974">Certainly sir, it could not be -- I'd hate to put my native state in the position of exacting a tribute of $20 -- 20 cents a day, a dollar a week to repay the cost of a $215 transcript on an economic basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.015" offset="1439431">And so I think that in the large public policy area in which this case falls, it clearly has the – an intended effect to discourage exercising the right to take an appeal granted by the New Jersey constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.273" offset="1672443">Now, public policy, I think pervades the entire issue because if penalogically, it makes good sense to pay whatever the minimum wage might be in New Jersey state prison at the moment and the stipulation of facts indicates that with respect to Rinaldi, its 20 cents a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.606" offset="1757811">If this is good penalogically speaking, why then should New Jersey turn around and permit the county which laid out $215 for the transcript to take back this 20 cents a day.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.565" offset="2465625">I think Mr. Justice Harlan that you could justify a statute that was in somewhat of this pattern if it conformed to a state policy of repayment of debts by garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.642" offset="2517974">For example in New Jersey, we have as I recall a garnishment statute, nothing up to $18 a week, may be garnished to repay a civil indebtedness and beyond that 10% of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.157" offset="2584012">If there were a reimbursement statute that was in that vein, in that setting, I would be prepared to say sir that this would probably be acceptable as far as I'm concerned but I come down here to the fact that we have the indigent situation and we have the great and sovereign State of New Jersey saying we are going to do something to restrain the multitude in these appeals that were -- we're being forced to accept because this can be the only intent of the statute and it is said to be one of intents by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.119" offset="2739806">I think this that if we were to have a general garnishment statute which provided that sometime within the next 20 years, the man had a job, the state would not be barred by any statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.661" offset="2813994">It could pursue the collection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.925" offset="4639117">I'm not certain in my own mind exactly what constitutional grounds appellant concentrates on in his attack upon the New Jersey statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.034" offset="4687496">There was some confusion in the proceedings below as to whether or not an Eighth Amendment and the Thirteenth Amendment ground were advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.792" offset="4734516">In the brief presented to this Court, it would appear that appellant has argued that the statute violates both due process and equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.481" offset="4781328">And then there was a separate argument with respect to discrimination in the application of the statute to this appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.926" offset="4815078">Whatever they purport of the constitutional attack is however, it is extremely important to understand and appreciate the New Jersey statute in its totality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.533" offset="4861471">We have suggested in our brief that this statute is designed to provide an indigent with an effective and prompt right of appeal and in some measure, to minimize the cost to the public and to discourage an abusive resort to the appellate judicial machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.605" offset="4949765">The legislative history as pointed out by counsel is barren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.526" offset="4973484">There is a statement next to the bill that was -- when it was introduced which indicates just simply that the statute was apparently in the past responsive to this Court's decision in Griffin versus Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="1273.647" offset="5197928">Well, let's -- left to infer however as to what else the New Jersey state legislature had in mind when it included in its statutory provision Section 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.566" offset="5253622">We have suggested, as I've just mentioned that reasoning from the obvious thrust of the statute, it must have been designed to discourage in some measure a promiscuous or wanton resort to the judicial machinery and although its impact is not great, it is designed in a minimal way to defray the clause that are otherwise visited on the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.811" offset="11406608">With respect to the argument of the appellant that there has been discrimination in connection with other types of criminal defendants, I would of course urge to the Court that there is a meaningful or invidious discrimination as far as prisoners convicted of capital offenses may be concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.811" offset="11510575">But with respect to successful indigents the non-assessment of costs I think is reflected of the general state policy that costs are normal incident to litigation with respect to a losing litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.580" offset="11577657">With respect to the unsuccessful, non-indigent, of course the simple answer to that is that he's paid his costs and not only his transcript costs but of course all of the costs of litigation which include his attorney's fees, printing costs, costs of investigation and any other fees that may be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.537" offset="11669504">With respect to the argument that there has been invidious discrimination in the application of the statute, I think that the Court must appreciate that the mechanics for the reimbursement of the statute arise upon a request by county officials that reimbursement be had against a particular inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.433" offset="11777128">Criminal prosecution of course is handled in the State of New Jersey by their respective counties and so there maybe some unevenness in terms of the overall application of the statute but certainly there is no basis in this record for the assertion that this is discrimination, is invidious or purposefully selected.</text>
