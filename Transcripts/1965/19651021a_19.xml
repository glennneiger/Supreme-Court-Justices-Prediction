            <text syncTime="21.225" offset="188270">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.226" offset="204257">This case which is here on writ of certiorari to the Fourth Circuit, raises an unsettled question of federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.844" offset="242709">How are the district courts to determine, whether diversity of citizenship exists, when one of the parties to the case is a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.743" offset="286386">Now this case was instituted in the State Courts of North Carolina, the County Court of Mecklenburg County.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.574" offset="317628">The respondent here, the company filed a complaint against the union, alleging that it had been libel by a pamphlet distributed by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.340" offset="364753">It sought as damages $100,000 actual damages and $100,000 punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.925" offset="407071">The only parties to the action were the company which was the plaintiff and the union which was the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.243" offset="436328">The union removed the case to the Federal District Court, alleging the diversity of citizenship existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.842" offset="466735">It asserted in its removal papers that the plaintiff company was a citizen of North Carolina, because incorporated there and having its principal place of business there, and that the defendant union was a citizen of Pennsylvania, because they were not incorporated that was the state of its principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.366" offset="548864">The company moved that the case be remanded to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.209" offset="568195">It acknowledged that it was a citizen of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.079" offset="583659">It did not dispute the union's contention that Pennsylvania was its principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.567" offset="609677">But it asserted that notwithstanding those facts diversity of citizenship did not exist because it said a union has no citizenship for diversity purposes, and that the courts must treat it when it's a party, as though it were a citizen of every state in which it has a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.421" offset="685014">Since this union, the United Steelworkers has a member in each of the 50 states, including of course North Carolina, this meant on the company's theory that no diversity of citizenship existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.467" offset="741230">The district judge refused to remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.825" offset="754709">He held as the union had urged that it was a citizen of its principal place of business, Pennsylvania and that this was therefore a suit between a North Carolina plaintiff and a Pennsylvania defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.261" offset="804446">The company sought and obtained interlocutory review and the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.355" offset="832763">It held as the company urged, that a union has no citizenship of its own and that the district court must look to the citizenship of each of its members and that therefore a union such as this one with members in each of the 50 states, is to be treated as though it were a citizen of each of the 50 states and therefore incapable of removing cases to the federal courts on the ground of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.552" offset="941537">The question before this Court therefore, is whether labor union shall be treated as corporations have since 1844, as having a citizenship distinct from that of their members or in the corporate case their shareholders, or whether they are to have as the Court below held no citizenship and therefore be deemed citizens of every state in which they have a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.598" offset="1053759">Now of course the governing standard is Article III, Section 2, of the Constitution which creates the diversity ground and 28 U.S.C., Section 1332 (a), which confers that grant upon the lower District Courts and both speak in identical words.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.009" offset="1127424">The Constitution provides that the judicial power, the federal judicial power, shall extend to controversies between citizens of different states and the statute provides that the District Courts shall have original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.049" offset="1187610">Of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum value of $10,000 as it does here, and is between, in the words of the Constitution, citizens of different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.550" offset="1241527">The question therefore is whether under these provisions the union like the corporation is a citizen, and in our view the beginning of that inquiry is to look to the purpose of the diversity jurisdiction, and to see whether it applies to unions as to corporations, so as to warrant their being treated as a single entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.442" offset="1325119">Now there have been historically great debates about what the purpose of the diversity jurisdiction is, and what it was when it was originally conferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.319" offset="1360645">But from the time of Alexander Hamilton's statements in Federalist Number 80, down through the legislative history of the Congressional amendments in 1958, one overriding purpose has been consistently expressed and we think must be accepted as the governing justification for the diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.501" offset="1445386">And that purpose is that a neutral forum, a federal forum be provided, when an outsider is forced to litigate in the courts of its adversary or in the geographic region of his adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.451" offset="1509125">The theory was as Alexander Hamilton put it in the Federalist, that in such cases the state tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.017" offset="1547473">And as concluded by the Judicial Conference in the 1950's and adopted in the Congressional reports in 1958, there is a great bulk of expert opinion from those who litigate in the courts, that local prejudice continues to exist and that the federal courts are in truth a strong protection against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.179" offset="1624064">Now, we submit that the labor union today going into those states where it is not principally found, is subjected to and receives as much local prejudice as does a corporation, which though present in that state is not principally found there.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.512" offset="1693445">And that the purpose of the diversity grant under the statutory conferral of that grant is equally applicable to the union, as to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.338" offset="1728763">To demonstrate that indeed we do encounter local prejudice we have appended to our brief just a few leaflets which were introduced at one Congressional hearing, to show the kinds of local appeals which are made to persuade people to reject unions, when they are running labor board elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.984" offset="1803264">Now, these were submitted by one union and they refer to one area of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.497" offset="1821341">That these leaflets are encountered by unions and these appeals to local prejudice are encountered by unions, all unions not just this one, in many sections of the country, indeed in all of those where they are not -- what might be described as the non-industrial states, those where the unions are not commonly found and principally found and very much at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.841" offset="1906709">And the common theme of all of these leaflets is that the union is the outsider, don't let this outsider into our community, let's not bring this outsider into our community and they reflect what really is today an economic conflict between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.532" offset="1973478">We have today a great battle to attract industry between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.945" offset="1995107">We have some states trying to keep it and others trying to attract it and all of them very busily engaged in what is this form of economic competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.073" offset="2027708">And some of those states have sought industry and advertised for it, on the ground that labor standards are a less expensive here and that this is an attraction, which you should look at when deciding to come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.763" offset="2082461">As a result of this conflict people in those states which are seeking business on this basis are constantly urged, as they are in some of these leaflets and editorial, constantly urged to reject the unions, let's not let them in here, because once they come in this great argument that we have to attract business to this region will disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.553" offset="2173576">So that when a union is sued in the State Courts of such a state, where such appeals have been made, and where such local prejudice against them does indeed exist, it faces a mighty burden and a mighty danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.441" offset="2225089">In this case for example, a prominent local corporation is seeking damages to the tune of $200,000 against a union which has come to that state and sought to organize its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.389" offset="2280887">Now, to be sure this union does have a few more members in that state, they constitute less, considerably less than one-tenth of 1% of its membership, but there --</text>

            <text syncTime="562.930" offset="2355075">It has, I understand a couple of plants in North Carolina and therefore couple of locals.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.657" offset="2373987">It had no local at the situs of this plant, because it doesn't create one until after it's organized the employees and they've elected it and of course in this case as it happened, the union was not elected, so no local was ever created.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.926" offset="2423097">But it does have a couple of locals in the state of North Carolina and it may be that even on their theory those locals which are independent entities, independent legal entities, might be citizens of North Carolina.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="637.427" offset="2653080">Well we think and I hope that will develop in my argument, that the standard which ought to be used in determining, whether an unincorporated association is a citizen, is not a broad one which says that every unincorporated association is a citizen, but one which looks to the legal characteristics of the association to determine whether in fact it is so viewed as an entity distinct from it's members, that it is likely to be subjected to the prejudice of an entity or whether in fact it is primarily a loose group of people associated together which perhaps has a few characteristics of a legal entity, but not very many.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.890" offset="2806888">We think indeed that this Court has already said that in Puerto Rico versus Russell which I'll come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.022" offset="2827473">Now it may well be that in the common partnership the two men who bound together, the characteristics of legal entity, which have been assigned to that partnership, are considerably less, indeed I am sure they are, then that which is assigned to the labor union today.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.558" offset="2889644">For many more purposes the partnership is not an entity but two men joined together, who are treated as two individuals for numerous purposes in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.378" offset="2932903">For many less purposes as I'll show is a labor union so treated as a group of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.960" offset="2955264">Indeed it is now I think safely to be said treated as much an entity as is a corporation and we will show this I hope in the course of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.682" offset="3006151">Now to be sure we have spelled out the prejudice which we, the labor union fear, the local prejudice which we fear in certain states, but this is not a one sided matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.032" offset="3047528">There are those who must sue the union where it can be found in its states, who feel that in such states they are the outsider and it's they who want the protection of the diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.963" offset="3095176">Indeed this is I think the first case ever to reach an appellate court in which it's been the labor union asserting that diversity exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.786" offset="3130493">There have been only a few cases in the appellate court that those that have gotten there with the exception of this one, have been cases when the labor union is adversary in the proceeding, usually an individuals, sometimes a corporation, is alleging and asserting that diversity exists and that therefore they are entitled to the protections of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.750" offset="3202382">This is very much as is I suppose every diversity consideration a two-way street.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.771" offset="3222444">You are an outsider somewhere and you are insider somewhere and whichever side you are on, someone would like to be in federal courts for its protections, where indeed you have citizens of different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.246" offset="3276361">Now the plaintiff, the person who wishes to sue the union has gotten rather sympathetic treatment from some of the Courts of Appeals including the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.116" offset="3319829">They recognize, indeed they say it would be a failure of justice if one could not bring the labor union into the federal courts on diversity grounds and they have therefore approved the procedure of suing union in a class action, not naming the union, but naming certain representatives of the union as the defendants, being careful to select only representatives who's citizenship is distinct from the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.410" offset="3413034">And then under the prevailing doctrines of this Court, since you look only to the representatives of the class to determine diversity, then finding that there is here diversity of jurisdiction because the plaintiff is a citizen of state A and the particular of representatives of the labor union named are not citizens of state A.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.444" offset="3481161">And they have said that this procedure allowing this class action was essential to bring the labor unions into the federal courts on diversity grounds and essential to prevent the failure of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.667" offset="3534033">We submit however that while that decision and the desire to bring the federal court -- the labor unions into the federal courts as defendants is entire sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.260" offset="3572381">That it's grossly unfair to say that the labor union likewise doesn't have the opportunity to remove it's case to the federal courts on diversity grounds, because the consequence is that the plaintiff is given the absolute option.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.909" offset="3618983">This North Carolina citizen who wants to sue what really is a Pennsylvania corporation can choose which court we will be in, if it wants to sue us in federal court it sue as a class and it will have diversity under the decisions of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.801" offset="3674572">But if it wants to prevent us access to the federal courts, it may only sue us in our common name as an entity and under the decision of the court below we are forbidden to remove this case to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.950" offset="3727130">This we think a far greater of failure of justice than one which would keep both parties out of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.781" offset="3758477">And so we submit that if this question were one of first impression and for reasons which I'll get into, we don't think it is, that looking to the purpose of the diversity jurisdiction, looking to the fact that this Court has since 1844 concluded that, that purpose warrants treating a corporation as a citizen, that likewise a labor union should be treated as a citizen for diversity purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.953" offset="3851160">But we think it's not a case of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.329" offset="3860668">Indeed, we think this case is governed by this Court's decision in 1933, in Puerto Rico versus Russell.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.278" offset="4052511">And the Supreme Court first took a broad look at its decisions dealing with corporations and it said, we have said that a corporation is a citizen or treated as a citizen, not because of any magic surrounding the act of incorporation, but because the corporation is a complete legal personality, is endowed with a complete legal personality and therefore it is convenient to treat it so as a legal personality for purposes of diversity jurisdiction as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.841" offset="4170689">And it said the question we must decide with respect to this unincorporated association is whether it too has been endowed with a complete legal personality for other purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1491.258" offset="6068433">You cannot read it I think and come to another conclusion, that if an unincorporated association has the same legal characteristics as a corporation, it should be treated the same for the purpose of diversity jurisdiction, of all kinds of Federal Jurisdiction, including diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.455" offset="6133217">Now one more thing I'd like to point to, corporation is not a citizen for all purposes under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.422" offset="6157040">That word appears in a number of places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.983" offset="6167280">Corporation is not a citizen for the purpose of privileges and immunities, it has been held such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.341" offset="6184730">It is a citizen for the purposes of diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.503" offset="6201344">Likewise it is not a person for some purposes, but it is for others and the case we would like to call to Your Honor's attention which appears at pages 34 and 35 of our brief, is United States versus White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.061" offset="6247633">That involved the question is a Labor Union entitled to treatment as a person with the privilege against self incrimination and the Court had already found that a corporation is not and the question was is the decision with respect to corporations equally applicable to Labor Unions and what the Supreme Court said was we've looked to the purpose of this Constitutional Clause, we've already said that it is not applicable to corporations and we find that Labor Unions are so much like corporations today that the same purpose and the same justifications require that they be treated the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.121" offset="6387858">Since a corporation does not have the privilege neither does a Labor Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.037" offset="6403532">We submit that here in Russell the reverse is true, since the Court -- Russell in this case, since the corporation is a citizen for a diversity purposes, so should be the Labor Union, which is precisely like it in all legal respects and I should like to reserve the remainder of my time if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.769" offset="6490467">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.134" offset="6507917">On this appeal the union is faced is with an adverse opinion on the law, an experienced Circuit Court composed of Chief Justice Sobeloff and Circuit Judges Bowman and Bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.497" offset="6573328">A record which does not contain the proof that would be required for the union's standard and by actual facts which would show that the union has a greater political strength in the area, does then does -- then does respondent Bouligny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.866" offset="6646888">In the oral argument if I may, I would like to try to make these five points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.049" offset="6679594">One, the record does not establish the facts required for diversity jurisdiction, applying the test suggested by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.945" offset="6719195">Second when the action was filed, the law was clear that the union had no right to remove from the state to the Federal Court on the grounds of diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.982" offset="6767261">Third the existing law as established by this Court, has the advantages of simplicity and of certainty, important on jurisdictional questions and the rule suggested by the union is difficult to apply and uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.822" offset="6846673">Four the classic reasons for diversity that is prejudice against litigants from outside the state is unlikely as against a union with a local establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.689" offset="6898082">We finally fear if the long settled law is to be changed, the change should be accomplished by legislation after completion of a careful study now being made by the American Law Institute at the request of the Chief Justice of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.077" offset="6987630">Now on the first point the record consists only of the complaint, the summons, the notice, the motion to remove, the fallable bond, the motion to remand, an affidavit which we filed by a plaintiff in a companion suit Mr. N.F. White as the union's local membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.707" offset="7086164">The District Court's memorandum opinion was rendered after an informal hearing in chambers at which no evidence was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.220" offset="7128273">There are no findings of fact apart from the memorandum opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.330" offset="7148648">The record as such contains no evidence as to how the union in fact is organized, how the union in fact operates, that in fact its principal place of businesses is in Pennsylvania or is the union as thrown in its brief that Bouligny is a prominent local corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.016" offset="7239450">Now the point is that when the jurisdiction on diversity grounds is put in issue, the burden of supporting its jurisdiction allegations falls to the union by competent proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.500" offset="7305383">There is a case which we cite of Thompson against Gaskill decided by this Court in 1942 in which Mr. Justice Frankfurter for the Court said the policy of the statute conferring jurisdiction upon the district courts calls for strict construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.577" offset="7377690">Accordingly if a plaintiff's allegation of jurisdictional facts are challenged by the defendant, the plaintiff bears the burden of supporting the allegations of complaint by -- allegations by competent proof, the bill must be dismissed, if the evidence in the record does not support the allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.867" offset="7462849">Now broadly the union contends in this case that you should adopt the rule that because they say and because the district judge said and because certain court actually assumed that a modern labor union has these corporate characteristics, that the same rule should be applied to it as has been applied first by the Court and now by Congressional legislation in 1958 to corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.776" offset="7578520">And we suggest to you that there is nothing in the record about this particular corporation, about this particular defendant that would enable a court to find any facts and that under the law, it was up to the union to put into the record those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.006" offset="7655424">Second point, when the action was filed in May of 1963, the law was perfectly clear that the union had no right to remove from the state to federal court on grounds of diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.621" offset="7713834">This Court had so held in Chapman against Barney, cited in our brief, in Great Southern Hotel Corporation against Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.991" offset="7747375">Seven of the ten circuit Courts of Appeals had so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.463" offset="7769213">In three of those cases this Court had denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.561" offset="7785618">Those cases are cited on page 19 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.609" offset="7805785">The study being made currently by the American Law Institute states under existing law the actual citizenship of each member apparently has to be taken into account in determining whether diversity exists, I'm quoting the American Law Institute study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.810" offset="7886660">About five years ago, Chief Justice of this Court requested the American Law Institute to make the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.417" offset="7917066">I'm quoting from the 1965 proposed final draft on page 61.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.108" offset="7947786">I will read the language again. “Under existing law the actual citizenship of each member apparently has to be taken into account in determining whether diversity exists.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.743" offset="9578350">He would be in the situation of applying the law of North Carolina where there would not be a direct appeal to the highest court of the state of North Carolina, which is I understand it is not thought by authorities to be a desirable situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.420" offset="9709066">I might suggest to you that, that is not prejudiced in North Carolina as I suppose elsewhere, that the country clubs against labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.855" offset="9754833">As I think it would be recognized, that they are many social and economic groups in which corporations and corporate officers are not particularly popular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.968" offset="9803212">But the point is that the Federal Courts in diversity matters do not sit for the purpose of affording jurisdiction in every matter of prejudice, but sit only for the purpose of protecting litigants against prejudice which arises against them because they happen to reside outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.419" offset="9873011">I suggest to the Court that if any prejudice would exist against the union in this case it would not be helped by the suggestion that this union happen to have its headquarters in Greensboro, North Carolina or some other place in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.421" offset="9933093">In other words, if there is any prejudice that would apply against this union it does not arise because it is not a North Carolina union, it arises out of economic reasons that have nothing to do with briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.140" offset="9991920">Now finally, the last point that I wish to make, If the long settled law is to be changed, the change should be accomplished by a legislation, after completion of the careful study that's now being made by the American Law Institute at the request of Chief Justice of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.647" offset="10097977">About five years ago Chief Justice made that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.623" offset="10117831">Mr. Richard Field of the Harvard Law School was named as the reporter of that study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.232" offset="10152312">Beginning at least in 1962, perhaps in 1961, but I believe I'm certain as to 1962 and each year since then at the annual meeting of the association, Mr. Field and the distinguished group of scholars that he has associated with him, have submitted to the annual meeting of the American Law Institute proposed recommendations in regard to the division of jurisdiction between the state and the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.310" offset="10276655">At the meeting in 1965 there was submitted a proposed final draft number one, which completed the study on the general head of diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.930" offset="10327124">Now the reports that have been submitted contains some recommendations in regard to the matter that's at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.698" offset="10370173">The reporters recommend some changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.662" offset="10381981">They do not recommend the changes that have been suggested by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.475" offset="10409253">What does now 1332 having to do with diversity jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.241" offset="10424299">Well under the numbering section of proposed legislation be numbered as Section 133.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.851" offset="10462751">That would provide that except as provided in this section and Section 1302 of this title, that district courts shall have jurisdiction originally or on removal of any civil action between citizens of different states, citizens of a state or foreign states or citizens of the subject thereof, citizens of different states in which foreign states or citizens are subject thereof additional bodies, wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000 exclusive of interest or cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.937" offset="10591169">In Section (b) for the purposes of this section and Section 1302 of this title, one a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of every state or foreign state by which it has been incorporated and of the state or foreign state where it has its principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.216" offset="10680195">That follows Section (c) of the passed law except that it adds the language a foreign state which is thought to be in doubt under the present law but which is not material here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.448" offset="10725125">It then adds another section that's directly in point as to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.732" offset="10746337">A partnership or other unincorporated association capable of suing or being sued as an entity in the state in which an action is brought shall be deemed a citizen of the state or foreign state where it has its principal place of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.485" offset="12665292">I would think that if any group could acquire a local personality it would be a local church for instance or some other eleemosynary institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.633" offset="12741883">We think if the law is to be changed it ought not be changed along the lines of Russell, which would be complex, but that it would be better as a matter of working all of these things out if the report of the American Law Institute could be completed and if the Congress could then have appropriate hearings about it and if these things that affect venue, affects labor relations and a great many other things could all be considered at one time and the thing brought about in an orderly fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.020" offset="12879496">I should like to devote the reminder of my time to two points raised by counsel for respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.085" offset="12899662">The first is as to the entity status of a union vis-a-via a corporation and specifically in response to Mr. Justice Brennan's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.113" offset="12927875">A labor union now to our knowledge is suiable as an entity virtually in every state of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.469" offset="12949295">In the last ten years the state courts by statute and by modification of their common law have made a union an entity not only in that respect, but they have made a union such an entity that it may sue for libel of the entity as such, something which was not --</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="3226.740" offset="13010317">And it marches on because the union has become an entity and recognized as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.591" offset="13029752">And the clearest indication of this is the Landrum-Griffin Act in 1959, which really is a corporate charter for labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.660" offset="13062040">You've got to have a Constitution and bylaws, you must file in as public records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.773" offset="13078444">You must have elections at periodic times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.485" offset="13089311">You must not have certain kinds of trusteeship and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.562" offset="13101641">The entire structure of a union is regulated precisely as is a corporation and Congress said that the reason for that was, it said in the legislative report, that unions have now become like corporations to be entities distinct from their members and must be regulated as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.953" offset="13159215">So we think insofar as the entity question is concerned, the union is like the corporation an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.738" offset="13182307">More on that Mr. Grier said that the problem will be in every case you'll have to try the facts of the labor union's entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.478" offset="13209266">But these are not questions of fact, but of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.372" offset="13220864">The law makes the labor union an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.638" offset="13229955">Federal law primarily Landrum- Griffin and so on and virtually unanimous state law as a result to these amendments over the last ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.236" offset="13260361">The second point I'd like to reach is the suggestion let's leave it to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.499" offset="13277393">A very appealing suggestion I suppose, although the Court has to decide the case one way or another, in whichever way it decides it of course it will ultimately do what the Congress which has the right to amend this Court's decisions on the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.760" offset="13326399">But we suggest that Congress has already exercised the full scope of it's constitutional jurisdiction, for it has written a diversity section of the statute in precisely the words of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.681" offset="13374046">If, and this has been true in 1875 Congress almost wrote the Constitution into the statute, not only for diversity grounds, but for all jurisdictional ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.758" offset="13406438">It has then over the years written exceptions in to be sure there is a $10,000 jurisdictional amount, there are a number of exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.976" offset="13431306">There is non saying labor unions are not to be treated as citizens, and so we have a statute in the words of the Constitution saying there is jurisdiction between citizens of different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.070" offset="13467669">If Congress has the constitutional power to allow a labor union to remove the case on diversity grounds, then presumably it has done so by writing the statute in the words of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.145" offset="13563904">Well, that's right it may not be constitutional to make a labor union a citizen, but if it is constitutional we say Congress has already done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.071" offset="13595669">So it maybe unconstitutional, but if it's constitutional, it cannot be left to Congress because Congress has done it already, that is our point.</text>
