            <text syncTime="38.332" offset="256711">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.848" offset="278758">This case was brought by the government in 1960, under Section 7 of the Clayton Act and it involves a challenge to a merger that year of two major grocery chains in Los Angeles, Von's Grocery Company and Shopping Bag Food Stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.856" offset="358797">After a preliminary relief was denied and after extensive discovery proceedings were conducted, the matter came on for trial before Judge Carr in the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.322" offset="416684">The parties agree that the relevant product market in this case, the line of commerce, was the sale of groceries and related products by grocery stores and supermarkets and that the relevant geographical market, the section of the country, was the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, consisting of Los Angeles and Orange County's.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.950" offset="511143">So the sole contested issue was whether the effect of the merger maybe substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in the relevant market and on this the judge after the conclusion of the trial and having heard the evidence of both parties, held that the government had not proved that the merger might have this effect and he therefore ordered the complaint dismissed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Posner</label>
            <text syncTime="157.035" offset="731512">Oh, on supplier's product to grocery stores, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.046" offset="747604">None, just on the -- the only competitive effects have to do with competition in the retail sale of grocery products.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.381" offset="788877">This is an important case in the administration of the merger statute for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.914" offset="815000">First, this Court's decision will provide guidance to the enforcement of this law in the nation's largest industry and the industry which has the most direct and immediate concern to every American family.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.787" offset="878529">And second, that we think that this case perhaps more than any previous case before this Court, with possible exception of the Brown Shoe case, tests whether Section 7 is in fact, as its framers intended it to be an effective preventive remedy against anticompetitive practices and effects and before I begin my argument, let me offer a brief summary of the government's legal theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.979" offset="1011336">We rest our case on four propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.657" offset="1030040">First, that Section 7's basic concern is with preventing the emergence of highly concentrated or oligopolistic markets, the kind of markets which breed anticompetitive business behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.873" offset="1098898">Second, we think that in light of this prophylactic statutory purpose, a merger that occurs in a market which is still competitive in its behavior but which appears to be turning the corner into a situation of oligopoly it seems to be crystallizing as an oligopolistic market that deserves very close scrutiny under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.015" offset="1207463">And I'll explain that this was precisely the situation in Los Angeles on the eve of the merger where in this large market of 4000 competing concerns, eight had among them almost two-fifths of total sales and this is the level which students of industrial organization had deemed oligopolistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.064" offset="1311640">And furthermore, and very relevant here, this market share of the major firms had been increasing steadily for a substantial period of time before the merger and as we point out in our reply brief, this trend towards ever increasing concentration has continued steadily and uninterruptedly since the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.823" offset="1414666">Now third, where in such a -- such an industrial setting a merger unites two leading sellers in the market, two of the handful major firms which have emerged with significant market shares and in doing so, the merger has contributed substantially to the concentration movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.018" offset="1523440">We think the statute requires that it'd be forbidden in the absence of a clear contrary showing -- a clear rebuttal to the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.595" offset="1569729">And I'll explain when I get to that point, the kinds of evidence that we think is admissible and relevant in rebutting the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.826" offset="1622706">I'll explain that the merger of Von's and Shopping Bag which united the third and sixth largest firms in this major local market, was the kind of merger which eliminates a -- one of the few market leaders and thereby substantially increases its concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.711" offset="1710268">That's the kind of merger that should be forbidden unless the defendants can come back with some -- with a strong showing that the merger -- that the merger is in fact unlikely to have adverse effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.045" offset="1763558">And then finally, I'll try to show that appellees have not sustained their burden of rebuttal of the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.474" offset="1805249">Let me begin then by describing the relevant market, its history and structure and behavior on the eve of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.668" offset="1850075">Now, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Areas, Los Angeles and Orange County's, constitute a vast retail grocery market where the total sales of grocery stores and supermarkets run about two and a half billion dollars a year, which incidentally is as much as for example, the entire retail shoe industry in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.598" offset="1953729">This is just one local market, a local market which really dwarfs some whole industries that had been involved in previous Section 7 proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.989" offset="2011303">Now in a retail market of this size, one expects to and does find a large variety in number of competing grocery concerns and the District Court found that there were 4000 separate companies at the time of the merger and these are -- covered a considerable range in type of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.802" offset="2110568">At the top you had the large supermarkets, for example, Safeway -- large supermarket chains like Safeway which is a large national chain, which has in Los Angeles many supermarkets throughout the Area, each one of them might do a substantial buy-in like perhaps $5 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.760" offset="2202415">These chains had Dun and Bradstreet's top financial rating which enabled them to at least base in shopping centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.810" offset="2234598">They had their own warehousing and trucking facilities so they could buy direct without going through middleman and these large chains which as I'll explain, included Von's and Shopping Bag, were able to advertise in the Citywide Media, the newspapers, because they had enough stores scattered throughout the Area.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.648" offset="2329997">Now at the other end of the scale, one has hundreds and perhaps thousands of very small stores, delicatessens, the corner grocery which in Los Angels are called Mom and Pop Stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.790" offset="2386526">These are often very small and with antiquated facilities and appointments, and inadequate parking space, but between these extremes, there's very large and a very small firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.486" offset="2441279">The evidence shows that there are -- there is a range, small chains prosperous independent operators and the record also shows that there is a certain mobility, an upward and downward mobility in this market that small firms can wax large.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.310" offset="2516616">They can acquire stores and build themselves into chains and then very often or sometimes a chain may over-expand and get into trouble and go broke.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.192" offset="2568129">There is new entries in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.369" offset="2576802">There are new companies or enterprising businessmen who come in and then there are very many who leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.365" offset="2616822">The record clearly shows a long steady decline in the number of firms operating there.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.844" offset="2650781">Now, given this -- with this large variety and mobility of competitors in this market, there's unquestionably a certain competitive format.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.908" offset="2715042">Now, the District Court found that competition among the grocery stores and supermarkets, the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area is vigorous and we don't dispute that finding on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.595" offset="2773765">Now at -- that the appellees seem to think that once we make this concession, once we agree that there was competition in this market at the time of the merger and for the few years thereafter which are covered in this record, we're out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.456" offset="2849207">It seems to me that their brief is substantially devoted to the proposition that this was indeed a competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.521" offset="2901452">And we think this really is the beginning rather than the end of the Section 7 analysis because the Section 7 is really to be an effective preventive against the lessened competition which is associated with highly concentrated industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.762" offset="2974386">You can't force the government to wait in intervening in a merger movement until the market has ceased to be competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.035" offset="3019525">The point for intervention is that point where the market while still competitive is becoming concentrated where there are signs that -- it is beginning to crystallized in a wrong sort of way and while we don't dispute the proposition that it may be very difficult in many cases to know when a market is in danger where its competitive structure is in jeopardy, we think this is a very clear case for finding that the market was in this state at the time of the merger that it was in a dangerous transitional phase towards undue concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.929" offset="3215130">And hence it had reached a point in development where mergers have to be very carefully scrutinized to make sure that they are not moving the market towards this undesirable state.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.273" offset="3296423">Now the factors on which we rely for this initial proposition here that this market was in danger, if you will, on the eve of the merger is that the market share of a small group of large firms have been increasing steadily for the period of time covered in this record prior to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.454" offset="3401226">For example, in 1948, the eight largest firms had had 34% of total sales in development market and by 1958, that figure had reached 41%.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.930" offset="3463084">The share of the 16 largest firms had increased from 42 to 53%, the share of the 20 largest from 44 to 57%.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.382" offset="3512926">Now perhaps I should remark parenthetically at this point why throughout this proceeding, the government in presenting market share statistics has focused on particular years, 1948, 1954, 1958 and 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.084" offset="3599757">The reason is simply that these were years in which the Census Bureau conducted a business census.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.735" offset="3626297">Now, market share statistics obviously can't be derived and are not reliable unless you have a sum total against which you compare the shares of an individual firm or group of firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.610" offset="3685857">You have to have what statisticians call a universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.751" offset="3702366">And in this case of course, the appropriate universe for computing the percentage shares of these major firms are total sales of the grocery stores and supermarkets in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.543" offset="3761507">And since there are 4000 of them and many of them very small, and since the sum total is in the neighborhood of two billion or more, it's very difficult to gather these reliable universe figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.472" offset="3817305">Now, I don't think anyone disputes the fact that the Census Bureau is equipped to make these determinations, but once you leave census years for which you do have those determinations, you embark on a sea of uncertainties.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.793" offset="3886582">You are left with gross estimates and projections and guesses and samples of various sort and appellees have relied on some years, not census years, to show various market shares and we just want to remind the Court of the fundamental unreliability of market share statistics which don't have this census universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.490" offset="4009357">Now, having said that let me hasten to add that appellees own figures in general confirm the government's census data, showing this increase in concentration up to the time of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.701" offset="4074141">They have a table which is at page 2788 of the record which shows that between 1950, which was the first -- first year in that table and 1958, the share of the eight largest firms in this market increased from 33 to 39%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.687" offset="4150105">Now, their table shows a falling off of some extent in 1959, but that was a year in which a strike closed the major chains in Los Angels while leaving the smaller stores open for a month and this caused a large diversion of business to these smaller fellows and distort the year's statistics on market share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.035" offset="4275493">So however you look at it, the trend towards higher and higher levels of concentration is clear and as we point out in our relied -- in our reply brief, again using census figures, this trend continued after the merger until 1963, which is the last census year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.715" offset="4370265">Well, it's a little difficult to compute precisely because the Census Bureau had split the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area into Los Angeles County and Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.419" offset="4433063">But the figures show, for example in Los Angeles County, an increase from approximately 25 to -- give it to you precisely; Of the four largest firms between 58 and 63 in Los Angeles, their share arose from 24.6% to 30.3% and that would be the eight largest from 39 around it or from 40 to 43, and that of the 20 largest from 55 to 61.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.899" offset="4678928">Now, my second point in showing that this was a market which at the time of the merger was urging an oligopoly was becoming dangerously concentrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.321" offset="4732635">It has to do with the level of concentration that had been reached at this time, and which we think was a formidable level of concentration where the leading firms had large market shares, bearing in mind that we're talking about a market of some $2-2.5 billion dollars in sales where even a 1% share is $25 million dollars which is no mean total for a firm to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.598" offset="4849768">And furthermore, in appraising these market share figures, we ask you to bear in mind that the appellees have urged throughout this proceeding that the economies of scales, economists discussed them in the grocery industry, are not great.</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.598" offset="7849775">Now in reciting these market share figures that we have on the basis of 1958 sales, I don't mean to suggest that this market had reached the tightly oligopolistic, highly concentrated stage of -- say, the Philadelphia Bank case, where two firms had 44% of the market, but there was -- there were -- I might say the storm warnings of oligopoly clearly off in this industry because when you have a market in which eight firms have more than a third and almost two-fifths of the total sales, this is already a level which economists and students of industrial organization who classify, who study markets over long range, consider oligopolistic, consider at the threshold at least of oligopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.910" offset="8091042">So let me move from the background of the merger here to the merger itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.068" offset="8119672">The parties to the merger Von's and Shopping Bag were two of the leading firms, as I've already mentioned in this large market with 4.7 and 4.2% of total sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.314" offset="8172648">They had all the attributes of the major chains in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.685" offset="8198144">They had their own warehouse unit, distribution facilities, they at -- they were two of the handful of chains who advertised in the major media, the Citywide Newspapers, and they were two of only seven chains whose prices were carried in a book that was widely distributed in this area called the competitive survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.376" offset="8296887">And this was a list of some 3000 shelf items, and the prices charged for each of them by seven chains, the theory being that these were the major companies in the market and these were the people whose prices you ought to know before you set your own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.697" offset="8370134">Combined these merging firms had as I said, based on 1958 figures, almost 9% of total sales larger than any other firm and this was based on the total combined sales of a $185 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.141" offset="8455920">Now despite, if these figures, the -- or despite what I've said about these merging companies, there has been a suggestion in this case that this was really just a merger of small local firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.044" offset="8527600">Now Von's as a result of this acquisition, became a publicly held corporation whose shares are now traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.930" offset="8567097">It's not in indiciam of local ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.064" offset="8583607">It is moreover approximately the nation's 16th largest grocery chain now, and bearing in mind that this is a $50 billion industry and moreover and very significantly the parties have stipulated that Von's and Shopping Bag before the merger competed effectively with Safeway, a national chain with total sales are in the billions and which was the -- at the time of the merger, the largest firm in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.807" offset="8722578">Von's as a result of this acquisition was catapulted head focusing on this local market of the major national chains that operate there like A &amp; P, and Food Fair and Acme and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.748" offset="8782346">So, in this particular pond, this very large local market, Von's became a very large frog.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.560" offset="8817664">And we think that so far as the policies of Section 7 go, they are concern with preserving competition in submarkets, not just in considering the nation as a whole, the size of this firm definitely raises the gravest antitrust questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.893" offset="8894986">And I might also mention in discussing the circumstances of this merger, the suggestion that Shopping Bag was in some sense in trouble and that's why I've made the -- quite sold that to Von's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.577" offset="8949635">Now, there's no contention that this was a failing company or that it was anywhere near failure, it was making money, but nevertheless, its ownership felt that Shopping Bag's management was thin and that the company ought to be making more money and its ratio of profits to sales and profits to assets was lower than Von's for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.208" offset="9064155">Now it's clear certainly that one can't justify every merger merely on the ground that the acquired firm had some management difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.448" offset="9117132">Many of the largest corporations in this country certainly have had periods in which they were having some management difficulties and they weren't making quite as much money as they'd like to and perhaps even were sustaining loses, although that is not the situation here and there are many ways in which a company's management can be renovated and improved without being acquired by its major competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.611" offset="9221831">And there's absolutely nothing in this record to indicate that the only way out for Shopping Bag, the only avenue of relief from its management difficulties which had somewhat impaired its profitability, was to be acquired by Von's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.896" offset="9294973">Now finally to the impact of this merger; it eliminated a major competitive factor in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.486" offset="9337292">I've already mentioned the party stipulation that Shopping Bag competed effectively with Safeway, the largest chain and there's no doubt that Shopping Bag was one of the majors in this market, it was regarded as such by those who watch the market, by those who distributed these price surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.394" offset="9424959">So we are not concerned here with the merger, either between small firms or merger which takes out of the markets, nothing more than an insignificant run of the mine, marginal operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.973" offset="9479293">This merger removed as an independent competitor, one and perhaps half dozen or seven or eight firms which had emerged as the market's leaders and in doing so, the merger had a dramatic immediate effect on the structure of concentration in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.138" offset="9567901">The Von's share -- the two largest firms, based as throughout on the 1958 figures, rose from 14 to 17%, and that of the three largest from 19 to 23%, of the four largest from 24 to 28%, and of the eight largest from 39 to 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.512" offset="9657448">And if we go back to 1948 to trace the growth and concentration in this market over a long period of time, suggestion of Professor Box, preceded the share of the eight largest rose from 34% in 1948 to 42% after the merger on the basis of the 1958 figures, and this we think is a very substantial increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.897" offset="9782941">Now having reviewed the government's evidence here let me try to suggest why we think that this is enough proof that a merger may have the prescribed competitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.325" offset="9848665">And when -- and in discussing this critical issue, I'll try to -- at the same time, a deal with appellees suggestion that standards which the government is proposing here really constitute a rigid and sweeping per se rule which would stifle business growth by a wholly preventing mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.713" offset="9950229">I said earlier that I thought that appellees had based much of their argument and this is certainly a theme that pervades the District Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.778" offset="9998503">On the -- on a demonstration which was quite unnecessary, a view of our concession on this point, that this was indeed a vigorously competitive merger -- excuse me, vigorously competitive market both for the merger and after the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.823" offset="10078647">They apparently then and so reasoning confined Section 7 to either policing industries which have already would come oligopolistic or prevent perhaps with preventing mergers which -- in a competitive market stifle competition so that whereas the day before the merger, there was lots of vigorous competition -- a day or a year or two after the merger, that competition has been stifled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.186" offset="10204139">And they point as the proper applications of this Section 7, the previous cases in this Court which are by and large involved highly oligopolistic markets in Continental Can, in Rome Cable and in the bank cases, and even in Brown Shoe, the local shoe markets wherein a number of cases are rather concentrated to firms who might have 40% of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.712" offset="10322213">In these cases however, the most vigorous merger enforcement couldn't prevent, couldn't head off oligopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.223" offset="10356276">It's much too late for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.215" offset="10364217">The most you could do by vigorous enforcement of the Merger law was to keep open the possibility that if the merger rule was blocked for these large firms, natural economic forces might eventually push the market towards a less concentrated state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.596" offset="10457736">Now in this case, we're invoking a more truly perhaps preventive, and maybe even a more constructive application of Section 7 and it's the rule that we think Congress particularly had in mind because Congress realized this theme is clear in the legislative history that many markets and industries in this country had become highly concentrated, a fate which Congress attributed in large measure to the inadequacy of existing law to deal with mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.741" offset="10610291">And they plainly didn't want this kind of thing to be repeated in those markets and industries which weren't yet concentrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.965" offset="10659192">This means that the law is particularly concerned with what happens in markets which were still competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.764" offset="10686464">Now this -- of course, it doesn't mean that all mergers are all horizontal mergers in such markets are bad, are forbidden because they might be the beginning of an undesirable trend.</text>

            <text syncTime="4825.242" offset="19404361">On the basis of 1958 figures, assuming their accuracy, the answer would be yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.280" offset="19432469">They would then have had 8.9 if the merger had taken the place then instead of two years later, that's finding 74, record 3084.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.800" offset="19486595">But on the basis of 1960 figures when the merger did take place, Safeway had 8% and Von's had 7.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.806" offset="19538631">Now, the government criticizes our use of other than census figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.618" offset="19561827">But the fact is, the figures we used were obtained by the FBI -- and from the 38 leading chains in the area and turned over to us by the government pursuant to court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.951" offset="19659212">The affidavit of Gerald Harrison, record 896, indicates the work that he did in collecting actual sales figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.266" offset="19704456">We say the actual figures obtained by the FBI coupled with a stipulated market of 2.5 billion in 1960 and what they say were Von's-Shopping Bag combined sales of almost 100 million would produce a market share if that's correct, of only 7.2% for Von's and Shopping Bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.592" offset="19845726">They variously referred to our market share as 8.9%, 9% and almost 10%, but we suggest they can't have it both ways, they've stipulated to the 2.5 billion in area sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.836" offset="19914689">We know our sale -- the Von's-Shopping Bag sales for less than a 180 million and that does as I say brings down to 7.2%.</text>

            <text syncTime="5016.454" offset="20169226">Now, the question really is what was lost by the merger?</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.510" offset="20197439">And what was lost was a single local chain which had grown from a one-store operation in 1930 to a 38-store chain in 1960, 36 of those were in the relevant section of the country and had approximately a 4% market share.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.424" offset="20289076">What were -- remained as competitors, were five of the sixth largest national chains that's covered in finding 75 to 77, two multi-state chains, Lucky Stores and Mayfair, 17 regional chains, that is local, having ten or more stores and I might add seven of those 17 where new entrants after 1952, 126 other chains and some 3700 single-store operators backed up by huge cooperative buying organizations, Certified Grocers of California and Orange Empire Cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.894" offset="20527000">The origin and the growth of these cooperatives is very interesting, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.890" offset="20554898">It's traced in the findings, at record 3074 to 76, findings 29 to 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.665" offset="20614040">Before I trace that I would like to mention one thing Mr. Posner said, he said, “Well ever there's no need for these two concerns to merge because we admit both Von's and Shopping Bag before the merger could compete effectively with Safeway” and we certainly did admit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.334" offset="20692720">There wasn't any question about it, nor is there any question on the basis of this record and the testimony of the industry witnesses are very representative cross-section of whom we think we presented that the single-store operator can compete effectively with Safeway because by a membership and a retailer-own cooperative buying organization, they get these groceries on the shelf just as cheaply as a direct-buying chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.390" offset="20812884">We say, the single-store operators, the two-store operators, the two to nine store in the regional chains are all substantial competitive factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.454" offset="20865233">As a matter of fact, one of our witnesses, Mr. W. H. Crawford, who runs a single store in El Monte, surrounded by stores of major chains, and other concerns was I asked, well can you compete effectively with this larger chains on the discount houses?</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.276" offset="20948511">And he said, “The question is not whether I can compete with them, but whether they can compete with me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.214" offset="20980276">I think the record fully bears this out, because of their buying expenditures, which put them on terms of equality with a large direct-buying chains, a single-store operator has many advantages which a chain does not and the industry witnesses list these.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.697" offset="21074108">It includes personal on the scene management, something which most of them say is much more effective than they can get out of a chain store manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.784" offset="21122487">It includes greater flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.288" offset="21136488">They can make a change in prices or some policy in a matter of minutes, whereas the chain store manager has to go through channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.961" offset="21179225">They have an opportunity too and they all testified to this fact, take a more active role in the community affairs, and let's get well-known and develop a loyal patronage.</text>

            <text syncTime="6192.668" offset="24874088">We are in agreement with their mean -- with the end but in disagreement with the means by which they are carrying the statute out in this particular proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.518" offset="24917452">We represent Your Honors the independent grocers and the independent supermarket operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="6212.699" offset="24954128">Roughly that is -- those stores between one and ten units.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.209" offset="24988191">They are all local operators, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.479" offset="25001253">They all operate in one market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6228.206" offset="25016195">Now, they can be significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6231.864" offset="25030823">They can be in fact large, in terms of the government's standard here, which has to do with percentage of total sales in a market and depending on the market, depending on how large it is or how small it is, a single-store operator or multi-unit store operator, an independent supermarket operator, can be substantial in a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6259.425" offset="25141060">And they are, because we have before us in this case, where the acquiring firm had only 4.7% of that market, and the acquired firm had only 4.2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.106" offset="25195813">Now, the merged firms, the new firm had 7.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.930" offset="25219114">Now there aren't many independent operators in smaller markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.182" offset="25240116">They can have 7.5% of the market and therefore, this brings us to the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6291.762" offset="25270418">I have only a short time remaining and I would like to come to the key issues to what we think this case involves and Your Honors, the key issue here is the standard is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.676" offset="25318066">The standard, the premise for which the government raise this case and by which it pursues it, is wrong and as a result the conclusion is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.434" offset="25357145">Now we say it's wrong and I'd like to offer this conclusion so you can judge the merits of our argument as we move along because I think it's most important that you question everything we have to offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6324.916" offset="25403016">We are saying it's wrong because it disagrees with the policy of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.373" offset="25420884">We're saying it's wrong because it will not protect the competition, prevent oligopoly and prevent monopoly par but it will actually be create it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.942" offset="25463097">We are saying this is wrong because it will injure the growth and the development of local independent supermarket operators in competing against larger firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.935" offset="25515133">We are saying it wrong because it injures local control, which we have in this market, in many markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6360.366" offset="25544808">We are saying it's wrong because it may require the disapproval of future mergers by independents having similar market shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="6372.583" offset="25593710">We are saying it's wrong because it closes the merger route, because it closes the horizontal and many, many of the independent operators have very little interest and very little capability to engage in a conglomerate, a market extension mergers or in a vertical.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.189" offset="25668106">They're not only interested in staying within their product market and within their geographic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6397.199" offset="25692139">So by applying this very harsh standard, it closes the merger route to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6402.713" offset="25714186">They have no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6404.341" offset="25720769">This forces them to rely on internal expansion and we point it out in our brief Your Honors that if there are many disadvantages to forcing small local operators, small in terms of what you and I would consider it, but large in terms of the government's standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.621" offset="25789837">And we say that the policy here, the standard of the government is wrong because it is applying a standard in a way that will actually encourage malignant competitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="6435.056" offset="25843545">Now, why do we say these -- the standard is wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="6438.993" offset="25859323">Because, we say that market shares in terms of absolute amount, in terms of percentage what a particular operator has in terms of sales is compared with his total market, is not a good tool in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6457.486" offset="25933302">Market share is a tool, and in some cases, a very valuable tool, but it's not the only tool by which the Section 7 case can be judged, and we submit Your Honors that this is a case of first impression because we're dealing here with distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.644" offset="26005922">We're dealing here with an industry composed of over 200,000 nationally, over 200,000 food stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="6483.666" offset="26038000">So it's not always so that every horizontal merger can be judged in terms of Section 7 on the basis of market shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="6492.501" offset="26073422">And we're attempting to show that if this is done, it's going to undo the purpose that Congress had in passing this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.222" offset="26104247">Now, we feel that if the tool of market share is used and certainly in establishing a prima facie case that it necessary to show some reasonable relationship between the market shares and the competitive advantage, market power, ability to exclude competitors in the market, these are the indica we're after, not just market shares and we feel there has to be some relationship between market shares and what we're trying to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.339" offset="26252727">It's this, not market shares increase we're trying to prevent, its injuries, probable injuries to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6544.639" offset="26281880">Now, the trouble with the market share theory Your Honors, is that it provides the strictest rule for horizontals because obviously with market shares, you can't deal with the verticals if you were the conglomerate, now what's wrong with that?</text>
            <text syncTime="6559.713" offset="26342275">Because small business, independent operators, will engage in horizontals almost exclusively where the larger operators with larger capital, better management can go into different market, different product markets and geographic markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.702" offset="26410193">So we say that in some cases, it depends on the market facts, and on the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6582.520" offset="26433494">In some cases, you need a more extensive market analysis, than just market share and the trouble with this case is the standard is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6592.646" offset="26473932">Now, we understand, the government seeks a simplified test and we share that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="6599.564" offset="26501622">There should be some effort made to simplify this Section 7 cases with the record you have before you, but we're not objecting Your Honors, to shortcuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.193" offset="26548120">We're objecting to wrong cuts and there's no basis for saying that simplified test necessarily requires market shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="6621.704" offset="26590229">We would like to see in our briefs, our argument here is positive as well as negative because we believe in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6629.878" offset="26622934">We would like to see a broader measure in this case of testing the probability of injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6638.957" offset="26659192">I'd like to offer five major points, which we think are better than this market shares test.</text>
            <text syncTime="6646.627" offset="26689912">One, is there any decisive, competitive advantage shown or any probable decisive competitive that is shown for the merged company, anything in that nature?</text>
            <text syncTime="6658.081" offset="26735679">Two, what is the effect of the merger on opportunities for entry?</text>
            <text syncTime="6662.722" offset="26754278">New firms company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6663.876" offset="26758875">Three, what is the success of small firms in this market?</text>
            <text syncTime="6669.243" offset="26780296">Number three -- number four, how about the insecurity of leaders, the leaders in the market?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Posner</label>
            <text syncTime="7018.780" offset="28178474">Mr. Justice Black asked Mr. Bison whether he thought a merger of the two largest chains in the nation, A &amp; P and Safeway, would be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7029.314" offset="28220583">Now it seems to me clear on the basis of the test, he suggested that it would not be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7034.965" offset="28243257">He named five factors which he thought offers a preferable, more flexible test to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="7042.564" offset="28273664">For example, the fact on the opportunities of small firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="7047.152" offset="28291950">Well if A &amp; P and Safeway merged tomorrow, I'm sure there would be no immediately discernible effect on small firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="7055.249" offset="28324342">He talked about the emergence of new forms of competition like discount houses, just we point out in our brief are typically leaves two large chains.</text>
            <text syncTime="7065.176" offset="28364048">Well these new forms of competition if that's a relevant factor here are prevalent throughout the grocery industry and would be a basis under his test of justifying the largest conceivable merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7080.354" offset="28424756">He mentioned the effect on opportunities of new entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="7083.454" offset="28437191">And again, if A &amp; P merged today, tomorrow, there won't be any immediate -- immediately discernable effect on new entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="7092.821" offset="28474702">And I think same is true with his point about decisive competitive advantage if A &amp; P and Safeway merge their market share over the -- on the national level, I don't know precisely what it is, it would certainly be less than 10% and it would not appear decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7112.268" offset="28552443">In other words, the test that Mr. Bison suggest in the standards which Mr. Alsup has discussed are focused merely on the immediate effects of a merger on its immediate situation, how competitive is the market when the merger occurs and will the merger of itself transform this situation, affect various entry or give the resulting firm a decisive advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="7142.886" offset="28674905">And we're -- and our concern and the law's concern is with it -- is with the long range, with the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="7149.745" offset="28702386">Nothing that appellees have said offsets the fact that there has been a steady increase in concentration in this market which has reached a formidable levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="7164.754" offset="28762363">There's not -- there's no reason to believe that this trend is about to be reversed and we therefore think that looking to the future, this is a market where mergers between substantial firms in that market pose a real threat and Mr. Bison has expressed the theory of the government standard may someday be invoked, estoppled by this Court to prevent single operators of grocery stores from merging.</text>
            <text syncTime="7196.699" offset="28890154">On the theory I supposed that there may be some small towns in which a firm which has only one store may have a 4% market share.</text>
            <text syncTime="7208.437" offset="28937070">Now, we don't think that Clayton Act is meant to deal with markets which are that small with which our communities under the old Section 7 standard, you must establish an economically substantial market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7226.771" offset="29010422">And this $2.5 billion, Los Angeles retail grocery market was substantial, it's as large as many industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="7236.398" offset="29048978">And calling these two firms small locally-owned operators can't disguise the fact that by all reasonable standards, these are major corporations with the -- with combined sales of $185 million a year and a merger between them, if it has the competitive effects which the statute proscribes is of -- is certainly substantial enough to be of federal concern under Section 7.</text>
