            <text syncTime="29.775" offset="224486">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.553" offset="239637">This is another confession case arising out of a conviction of first degree robbery after a trial to a judgment of the jury in Brooklyn, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.643" offset="272029">The petitioner, Michael Vignera, was sentenced 30 to 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.762" offset="288434">His conviction was affirmed without opinion in the appellate courts of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.195" offset="306197">Briefly the facts are these, sometime during the morning of October 14th, 1960, Vignera was arrested in Manhattan after having been singled out by a confederate.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.874" offset="348933">The confederate had been arrested earlier that same morning for attempting to use a stolen credit card registered in the name of one Harry Adelman.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.250" offset="382370">Vignera was first taken to Manhattan Police Station and then transferred to another Manhattan Police Station for questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.490" offset="411418">At the second police station later that same morning, he was identified as the man who had robbed a Brooklyn dress shop a few days before.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.238" offset="442347">Identification was made by the victim, Harry, the same Harry Adelman, and an eyewitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.685" offset="464185">Then under police questioning, Vignera admitted having committed the holdup by means of a toy gun having obtained $93.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.719" offset="504310">Sometime thereafter at about 3 p.m., he was formally arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.703" offset="520192">Later that day he was taken to a Brooklyn Police Station for detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.998" offset="537433">At the Brooklyn Police Station at about 11 p.m., Vignera's deposition was taken by an Assistant District Attorney and a hearing reporter and that recorded confession was introduced to the subsequent trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.682" offset="592185">It amplified the earlier admission given to the police officer, included such additional details as the time of the day of the robbery, the fact that Vignera was operating alone, the weapon was concealed, number of persons in the dress shop, lack of preplanning, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.538" offset="659581">The next day on the way to court, Vignera was again questioned about the weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.526" offset="679539">Apparently his story didn't jive with that of the victim and he finally admitted in a -- in fact a knife rather than a toy gun had been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.646" offset="716006">And it is conceded, although the record admittedly is silent, it is conceded that at no time was Vignera ever advised of his right to counsel or to silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.383" offset="754981">For example, the confession which are -- purports to be a verbatim transcript has no recital of any kind as to a warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.368" offset="782879">It was not the practice in New York to give such a warning at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.449" offset="795209">I think it's entirely fair to assume that no such warning was given.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.500" offset="1999454">I think the question of -- this focus and arrest come at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.370" offset="2018889">I think that in the hypothetical you gave, the statement might well be admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.291" offset="2042608">Certainly, a laying on of hand is an arrest but the probable cause requirements and there was I think probable cause satisfied here because he'd been singled out by a confederate.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.042" offset="2109586">I can see -- of examples, for example, and the police have to make on-the-spot judgments taking four or five people who may have been involved in a crime, before they exculpate themselves and they're sent home and the fifth was proceeded against, maybe he's picked out of the lineup by the eyewitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.835" offset="2160786">At that point, it becomes clear that the accusatory proceeding has begun and then he'll have to be -- well then the police are going to have to show a waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.680" offset="2528172">For example, even before arrest, the accusatory stage might come into being if -- in a situation Government agents had a man on surveillance, and saw him commit some very speck acts and then laid their hands on him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1010.519" offset="4147451">Is in the -- alright, but I want to elaborate on that if I might.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.291" offset="4158631">In a deposition in a civil case for example, customarily the plaintiff and defendant would have counsel present but I could certainly conceive of one lawyer deciding not to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.697" offset="4192172">And through -- by his client through him would thereby waive that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.523" offset="4215474">But it seems the only way you could distinguish this case from Escobedo is the fact that Vignera did not make a request and -- we've even talking about with respect to waiver, I think, governs that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.974" offset="4257270">Obviously, it wasn't a request that makes the right attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.027" offset="4269495">The right attaches when the State proceeds criminally against the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.750" offset="4284437">The significance of the request, I think in Escobedo was that, was an objective piece of evidence to show that that stage have been reached there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.047" offset="4309619">Actually, it's even clearer in Vignera, that in this case that at least by 3 p.m., the stage was clearly reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.960" offset="4345250">As an independent ground to support reversal on this case, and that is the fact that Vignera was detained for an unnecessary period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.067" offset="4385688">I think that's true both under the state law and as a matter of common reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.609" offset="4407839">He was -- even after the accusatory stage is clearly reached to the police who had formerly charged him, he was not -- been arraigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.867" offset="4432917">He was not arraigned for nearly another 18 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.722" offset="4444306">And I think the point you raised yesterday Mr. Justice Black doesn't -- that detention, and I would add especially prolonged detention, does not cut down on the Fifth Amendment privilege, doesn't whittle it away, doesn't undermine it necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.646" offset="4496029">And I would say that it certainly does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.845" offset="4504806">As I said earlier I think that -- I hope that principle of the Court adapts this one which combines warning with a rule at least analogous to the guidelines set down by McNabb and Mallory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.554" offset="4547647">But even if there is a waiver, a man can't be detained indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.972" offset="4561335">Of course, in my case there wasn't even a waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.187" offset="5182213">It wasn't until 1964 that the -- the Fifth Amendment privilege applied to the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.936" offset="5285136">And the -- it's true that the word compel is used in the Fifth Amendment with respect to the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.523" offset="5315542">It's quite different to say that the privilege is cut down or impaired by detention and that a man's will has been so overborne that a confession is enforced from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.322" offset="5354726">And I must say, I was a little perplexed to read the Solicitor General's brief when they talked about -- the principle, they would have the Court adapt is basically a Brahm principle relating to Fifth Amendment privilege and they support that with citations, the coerced confession cases talking about having one's will overborne and going back to the totality of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.736" offset="5436332">The trouble with totality of circumstances in this field and that would get us back to Betts and Brady Mr. Justice Fortas that you mentioned yesterday.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.635" offset="5487950">I hate to sound too cynical but if we go back to the totality of circumstances, that means that this Court will sit all by itself as it has so many years to overturn a few confession cases that it can take necessarily by the bulk of its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.176" offset="5534135">And the lower courts won't do their job.</text>
