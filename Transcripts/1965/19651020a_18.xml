            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="33.465" offset="237275">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.234" offset="244276">This is a consolidated argument of Case Number 18, Scofield, and Case Number 53, Fafnir.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.974" offset="283251">18 at Scofield, raises the question whether a Union which is charged with unfair labor practices before the Labor Board and wins its case before the Labor Board and has that charged dismissed can intervene in the Court of Appeals when those who had charged it and seek to have it held in violation of the Labor Act go to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.330" offset="404668">This of course would be the same if the management were on the other side, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals refused us intervention in that respondent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.207" offset="452211">53 Fafnir differs only that the UAW was the charging party, not the respondent before the Board as in Scofield.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.677" offset="494111">Fafnir thus raises the question whether when the Union charges management with an unfair labor practice and wins before the Board, and management then goes to the Court of Appeals, whether we can intervene in those circumstances and of course it would be the same if it was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.418" offset="577076">Here, the Second Circuit also denied us intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.571" offset="593690">Now the Government's position is a strange one.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.344" offset="604766">They say we're right in Number 18, where we were the respondent before the Board but we are wrong in Number 53 where we were the charging party before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.838" offset="650742">We, of course, agree on Scofield, we disagree on Fafnir and we say that the government's own reasoning shows that the result should be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.987" offset="691284">I'd like to do Scofield only briefly because it's not in dispute, but I do want to state it and then go on to Fafnir.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.364" offset="724825">Facts of Scofield are these; a number of Union members employed at the Wisconsin Motor Corporation filed a charged against our Union under 8(b)(1)(A) saying that fines we had imposed on membership for exceeding production and pay ceilings violated the Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.361" offset="828792">A complaint was issued against us, a hearing was held on which we were the party defendant, we won the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.432" offset="861080">The Board dismissed the complaint completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.599" offset="873723">The employees went to the Seventh Circuit asking that the Seventh Circuit adjudge us in violation of the Labor Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.246" offset="960345">They asked the Court to find that we had violated the Labor Act and to order us to cease and desist doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.862" offset="994826">We were asked for intervention, we were denied, we asked for a rehearing, we were denied and that brought the -- in this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.975" offset="1027323">Now, this seems to me a simple case and as I say, the Board and the Solicitor General support intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.869" offset="1054804">In simplest terms, Scofield case involves a question with the silence of Congress on our right of intervention because there's no reference to it in the Act, should be interpreted in one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.976" offset="1103287">And the Government agrees with us that this Court under its supervisory power over the lower court should allow us to intervene in this Scofield situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.694" offset="1146128">Namely, where we are the respondent before the Board where an order would issue against us if the Court of Appeals reverse the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.870" offset="1938892">Then it goes back to the Board and orders entered directing us to do certain things, obviously we can appeal that.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.949" offset="2775124">And as we shall see, the Union's interest is just as great in 53 as it is in 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.186" offset="2800097">And indeed, this is the important area.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.262" offset="2812426">The Government has given this kind of a neutral business, they let us in 18, they won't let us in 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.891" offset="2846908">Well, I must say that this neutrality is sort of like one horse and one rabbit.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.045" offset="2867597">Fafnir is 90% of the cases because in 90% of the cases, the Board does grant some relief and this is in their brief, the Government's brief, the 90% figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.874" offset="2914826">And therefore, 90% of the cases involve Fafnir.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.305" offset="2928619">The Scofield case is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.421" offset="2937083">The Fafnir Case is terribly important because in the bulk of the cases, the Board does grant some relief, the appellant is the person against to the petitioner in the Court of Appeals, the person against whom relief runs, and if the Union is going -- the charging Union's going to be kept out of that, they're out of the review proceedings because that is the cases that you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.587" offset="3021720">In other words, it's perfectly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.491" offset="3025377">It's like in indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.297" offset="3028511">The Board doesn't issue complaints unless there is a good case most of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.136" offset="3043871">So that you don't -- you get remedial orders and the question is, whether we are going to get in and I'm going to try to show, time allotted to me that these cases are really the same and that every consideration in Scofield accept the due process consideration applies equally in Fafnir.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.389" offset="3120880">Now, the facts of Fafnir were these, we as a Union have a contract, the Automobile Workers with the Fafnir Bearing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.286" offset="3156511">This contract provides that the company will set standard production rates, and we get incentive pay above the standard production rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.796" offset="3194546">We have a right to file a grievance when we feel the standard production rates are -- demand too much of the workers that there really isn't a standard, that they're really holding them up to too much and that reduces the incentive pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.975" offset="3255254">Four cases at Fafnir, we were going to -- we're considering taking to the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.297" offset="3284511">We looked at their time.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.307" offset="3288586">Our engineers looked at their time studies, the Fafnir time studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.310" offset="3308648">We said, “They're no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.759" offset="3314395">We want to make our own time studies to decide whether to go to grievance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="809.375" offset="3340831">The company said, “Oh, you can't bring any engineers in this plant and look it over.”</text>
            <text syncTime="814.649" offset="3361938">We said, “Well we have a right under the statute, a right of collective bargaining, a right to do this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="821.349" offset="3388792">And we filed a charge on the ground that we had a right to make time studies and the company had denied us that right to make our own time studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.766" offset="3426408">Now, complaint was issued by the Board, a hearing was held to which we were a party, not even having to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.450" offset="3461204">The Board's rules specifically put us in as a party without anything we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.513" offset="3485445">We just -- we're a party automatically because we started it and they couldn't have even gone ahead without the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.469" offset="3513240">Well, we lost in front of the trial examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.909" offset="3522957">We filed exceptions along with the General Counsel of the Board and went before the Board and we won.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.001" offset="3547408">The Board said in so many words that Fafnir has to let our people in to make time studies so that in the time studies, we can determine whether to go to the -- to grievance procedure about whether these standard production rates demand too much of the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.980" offset="3615326">We petitioned to intervene in the Court of Appeals, Judge Friendly, in a -- his opinion and there is an opinion in that case, not in the other one, Judge Friendly hold against us what he said, “This debatable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="893.206" offset="3676244">It was obvious that he was torn both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.232" offset="3688260">I suppose I should start my argument with the only comprehensive study that's been made at this problem which is referred to on pages 16 and 17 of our green brief which is the brief in Number 53, Fafnir.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.045" offset="3755551">This was study was headed by Professor Archibald Cox and I had plan to rather push this thing down his throat, but he's not here, the previous capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.562" offset="3821589">But on his committee, he sure had some interesting people to make this study.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.815" offset="3846666">He had both sides, management and laborer, he had the leaders of both sides, he had two secretaries of labor, Goldberg and Wertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.468" offset="3877282">He had two -- he had the leading students of the subject in the mediation, Cole and Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.415" offset="3909047">He had lawyers, he had former Board chairman, former members Riley.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.412" offset="3929004">He had professors, Russell Smith and Gregory, he had the whole panel of labor lawyers from the most conservative to the most liberally, Dennis and Kitchell on the conservative side.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.193" offset="3972159">He had for example Louis Sherman who is the Labor Metal Trades Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.009" offset="3995460">So in other words, this was a most remarkable body that had been asked to study this among other questions and they just unanimously said, “We also believed --”, and this is on the bottom of page 16 of our brief, “We also believed that any party, the NRLB proceedings should be allowed to intervene in the appellate proceedings.”</text>
            <text syncTime="993.677" offset="4078111">And then they explained it on page 17, they say, “Although proceedings before the Board are undertaken on the public interest since 1947, they have been concerned with the vindication of essentially private rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.575" offset="4125654">Board is no longer charged solely with promoting the spread of labor unions and collective bargainings, largely an umpire engaged and enforcing established rules, first against the Union, then against the management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.245" offset="4172361">In other words, there has been one study of this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.683" offset="4186154">It was by a remarkably divergent group of all of the people interested in this whole field and headed by Professor Cox, and it urges this result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1048.962" offset="4299212">Section 7 of the Labor Act, in so many words, refers to the private rights of collective bargaining which is exactly what they refer to it as a right of collective bargaining which is exactly what the Board said we had here, a right for time studies as part of our collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.879" offset="4374862">In fact, the Board's opinion is kind of humorous in this respect, 12 times in the Board's opinion in Fafnir refers to the statutory right of the Union to have this, these time studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.346" offset="4436720">And this is a -- I can't tell you how important this kind of thing is to enforcing our collective bargaining contract with Fafnir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.182" offset="4468067">We are about to have a -- are we to go -- whether we're to have to go into a grievance blind or whether we have a right to do this as a terribly important thing to our Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.475" offset="4513311">Now, this Court continually recognizes the private rights or interest of Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.794" offset="4534523">For example, review of the collective bargaining unit this Court has reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.986" offset="4555316">That was our private right to -- of a Union to have a fair bargaining unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.192" offset="4584155">It recognizes 301 rights under collective bargaining contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.323" offset="4604635">In other words, there are private rights and look if I may call your attention to the name of the statute under what we -- we are operating, the 47 Taft-Hartley but the real name of that is Labor Management Relations Act, that's what this panel was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.850" offset="4682794">There's a labor management relations with the Board as the umpire but they're very real private rights on the side of both of the labor and management here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.665" offset="4726053">Now, of course, these private rights and private interest must be considered within a framework of the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.677" offset="4758131">There is just no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.338" offset="4768684">The Board is umpiring labor and management rights, but it's doing it in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.590" offset="4793762">But this public interest concept, we submit, is only a shorthand way of referring to those aspects of the Act relating to the exclusivity of the Board's jurisdiction and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.515" offset="4849455">It does not imply the absence of private interest or private claims within the public arena, and there, I submit, is the reconciliation of all the discussion of whether it's public rights or private rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.799" offset="4918523">The Board is trying to protect the public interest but it is trying to protect it as the umpire but with between very serious and important rights and interest of both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.321" offset="4972648">Now, if Your Honors please, every consideration of judicial administration here favors intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.213" offset="5012250">The first place where again you get this multiplicity of litigation difficulty, suppose we lose, not being allowed to intervene in the Fafnir case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.855" offset="5054777">They say, “No, Fafnir doesn't have to let your people in to make these time studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.536" offset="5069511">We go back to the Board, the Board dismisses the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.751" offset="5082363">Under 10 (f), we clearly have the right to appeal again because we will have been a party aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.533" offset="5105455">Now, the Government says, “Well, that's silly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.254" offset="5112351">You wouldn't have a right to appeal again.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.918" offset="5119039">But the statue says, “Anybody who is a party aggrieved to any Board order can appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.595" offset="5137742">The Board will be dismissing our complaint, we come back.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.914" offset="5151013">Now, of course the Court of Appeals would hold the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.725" offset="5162297">We're aware that that would be filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.614" offset="5169821">But then we petition for certiorari here and you wouldn't have the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.474" offset="5193226">Again, you'd be in the position of not having all the parties as you said you wanted in United States v. Louisiana and that can happen in Fafnir, and I want to tell you why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.149" offset="5235963">There's a Court of Appeals' decision in the Otis Elevator case previous to the Fafnir decision, exactly contrary to two to one decision by the Second Circuit saying that we have no right to the time study information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.586" offset="5289671">So that this is a -- this is a very important thing to us to get in front of the Second Circuit to try to persuade them not to follow their own decision in a previous case involving the Otis Elevator Company and this problem has never been resolved by this Court and it's an important problem and we would be back here with a petition for cert in a place where the respondent was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.189" offset="5380159">In other words, if you're going to get all the parties here the first time, you're going to have a better opportunity at this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.424" offset="5413073">Well secondly, I'm looking at the consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.131" offset="5427911">Look at this, we as the charging party are an automatic, an automatic party below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.311" offset="5460616">What the Board is saying to this Court is we need the charging party to help us decide but the Court of Appeals doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.524" offset="5493426">That's the most inconsistent thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.843" offset="5502725">The Board which is an expert needs us to help make the decision but the Court of Appeals that has ten Labor Board cases a year, doesn't need us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.105" offset="5543790">I would think of either -- it would be the other way around that if were so all far important to the Board, that they were an automatic party without intervention because they want our help in resolving these questions that somehow the Court of Appeals shouldn't be allowed to consider us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.155" offset="5607946">Well, there are -- we have in the brief in Scofield a number of other arguments of policy considerations through analogy, the Rule of Civil -- Rules of Civil Procedure, the contract problem, but I rather just -- to my mind, it's easier to state it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.614" offset="5689866">The Board concede Scofield but our interest is just as great here as in Scofield.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.107" offset="5727796">We have as much at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.234" offset="5736260">We have as big an interest and the way to prove this is to look at Fafnir and see what would happened if it had gone the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.333" offset="5784743">Suppose in 53 in Fafnir, the Board had said, “No, you are not entitled to the time studies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.621" offset="5837824">Then we would have been the appellant, the petitioner to the Court of Appeals and Fafnir would have been the intervener, the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.372" offset="5876903">The Board says, “Oh, that's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.085" offset="5887666">Fafnir could come in as a -- intervener as the respondent but you Union, you can't come in as a charging party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.032" offset="5919535">Well, you know what that brings the distinction down to?</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.132" offset="5931865">That if you're claiming you have a right to put time study engineers in the plant, you can't intervene if you win, but if you claim you have a right as management not to put time study engineers in the plant, then if you win, you can intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.354" offset="6012740">This is two sides of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.266" offset="6020472">The issue in Fafnir is whether the Union can put time study engineers in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.178" offset="6044087">If we won the case, we ought to have a right to ascertain the Court of Appeals that we want to put time study engineers in the plant just as if -- if the company won the case, they ought to have a right to put -- to argue before the Court of Appeals that we -- that we shouldn't put time study engineers in their plant but what the Board is now saying is, “Oh, the company can argue that you shouldn't put time study engineers at the plant but you Union, you have on any right to argue that you shouldn't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.455" offset="6161220">I just say it's the same case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.858" offset="6398830">That is the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.885" offset="6402905">That's exactly where I wanted to go, what the Government says, what the say is, “If we intervene, we can block settlement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.943" offset="6439163">That's really what the Government's case comes down to, that if we are allowed to intervene in the Court of Appeals, the charging party and Fafnir, we block settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.596" offset="6485765">And we -- and therefore, we shouldn't be allowed to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.327" offset="6496632">Well, my answers to that are several.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.686" offset="6506141">In the first place, this is a very speculative question whether there are all these settlement and in fact, if you look -- if Your Honor please, Mr. Justice Fortas, on page 28, right in the middle of the place, the middle of the page, the Government even states it this way, “If we were a party, we could conceivably force a continuation of the proceeding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.558" offset="6605615">Well, I don't think that speculation is grounds for denying us intervention but I'm willing to answer it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.990" offset="6639365">As the law now stands, we couldn't block settlement and my proof of this is the Government because on page 17 of the Government's brief, they point out at the bottom of the page that they can compromise cases before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.036" offset="6711568">But we're a party before the Board and if they can compromise cases when we're a party before the Board, why can't they compromise cases in the Court of Appeals when we're a party?</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.095" offset="6751796">We're no different before the Board where we are a party and they claim the right to compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.686" offset="6770082">Now, all I would say is, this is a premature question whether in fact, if we were -- because the Court of Appeals are split on this and this Court hasn't held -- this Court hasn't decided the question, the cases are set forth in footnote 18, in footnote 10 of the Board's brief on page 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.094" offset="6851793">But those cases are in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.645" offset="6857958">The Board has a little CF in there but the CF is a conflict between the Marine Engineers case and the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.709" offset="6890245">I'm not answering that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.550" offset="6893589">I don't know where the law ultimately will be as to the Board's right to compromise without the consent of the party who's involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.158" offset="6932041">But however that gets decided, that's premature now because we are not claiming that it's a necessary part of our intervention that we have a right to block a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.120" offset="6979897">Maybe we will and maybe we won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.716" offset="6986271">That law is yet to be settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.356" offset="6992750">It is confused in the Court of Appeals at the period we're before the Board but the Board asserts a right to compromise when we're before the Board, when we're a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.757" offset="7034441">And I don't see if they're asserting the right to compromise when we're a party before the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.115" offset="7359822">The Board also besides the argument on blocking settlement, they argue about the number of cases involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.682" offset="7438085">Well, I can't believe this Court is going to grant many certs that the intervener asked for, that the Board doesn't want you to grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.532" offset="7481448">You can always say “no” in this kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.799" offset="7502555">Then the Board relies on the Amalgamated case and that case really supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.169" offset="7528051">If you remember the Amalgamated case, aligned with Utility Workers case in 309, this Court held that the Union couldn't file of contempt proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.068" offset="7591685">But in that very case, the Union had been allowed to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.837" offset="7610702">If you look at 305 U.S., the Consolidated case which was the first of the two cases, there the employer, the Consolidated Edison Company was charged with unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.569" offset="7661693">They fought in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.820" offset="7670680">The Union was permitted to intervene and Louis Boudin argued in this Court as an intervener in that Consolidated Edison case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.747" offset="7706311">Then it came back and the Union is trying to go for contempt and this Court held it couldn't but right in the opinion in Amalgamated in 309, it says in so many words that the Union have been allowed to intervene in the court below and had been allowed to argue in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.439" offset="7773080">In other words, it makes the same distinction that I'm really making to Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2935.798" offset="11846614">The statute says anybody could file it and indeed even though 18 is out of this -- in 18 these. were Union members, it was the Union who filed the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.788" offset="11894575">Let's get that straight, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.957" offset="11907218">Number two, whoever files a charge is not automatically a party because it's been the Board's subtle position for many years that it could -- the statement about the charging party filing a charge, it's up to the General Counsel, the Labor Relations Act, unlike the other acts and to get to Mr. Justice Black's question, in a moment, I will get to the Amalgamated case and in that case, Chief Justice Hughes did go over all of the legislative history and concluded that it was the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.588" offset="12081716">And Mr. Rauh is conveniently slipped into saying that the NLRB is just an umpire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.338" offset="12112750">It's the opposite of an umpire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.280" offset="12124453">The ICC sets more or less as an umpire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.070" offset="12139604">But once the General Counsel decides not to file, it's not filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3381.499" offset="13629419">The intervention as a matter of right is really not intervention, you have made a party, and I frankly would hate to take away from the Court of Appeals the right in the proper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.589" offset="13677693">And the reason I have to say that is because of the second Amalgamated case in which the Chief Justice Hughes' case, in that case as Mr. Rauh said was whether or not the Union could go for contempt on a clear-cut order of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.953" offset="13751150">And Chief Justice Hughes after reviewing the legislative history found that both houses and the committees of both houses stressed the point that there was no private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.199" offset="13808201">And in this opinion for unanimous court, and incidentally the unanimous court only 26 days after the argument, said there could've been much a disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.196" offset="13856162">Chief Justice Hughes put all of the opinion on the question of whether or not this was on behalf of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.208" offset="13896182">And he said that it seeks enforcement as a public agent and not to give effect to a private administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.462" offset="13933171">This opinion has been severely criticized by such people as Professor Jaffe in Harvard Law Review and Professor Davis in his treatise but even Professor Davis says, it become deeply embedded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.628" offset="13989909">And Chief Justice Hughes also observed that so far it is apparent that Congress has entrusted to the Board exclusively the prosecution of the proceedings by its own complaint etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.948" offset="14047169">When the Board has made its order the Board alone is authorized to take proceedings to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.543" offset="14081546">Then he goes to the public interest and then he contrasts it with, Chief Justice Hughes, with the ICC regulations and says that they're entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.590" offset="14117700">And finally in regard to this private right which Mr. Rauh is so interested in, in the last paragraph, Chief Justice Hughes said, “If the decree of enforcement is disobeyed, the unfair labor practice is still not prevented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.982" offset="14199306">The Board will still remain as the sole authority to secure the prevention.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.353" offset="14220831">And I see no difference between that and this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.479" offset="14233266">Now, of course, Mr. Rauh is right about this intervening party and Mine Workers against the Eagle-Pitcher is a rather difficult decision for me at least, 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.083" offset="14307662">The Union complains that the Board ruled against the employers and the employer responds and sought review in the Court of Appeals and the Board sought enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.336" offset="14356668">And the Unions were permitted to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.617" offset="14377880">The Court of Appeals modified the order and decreed enforcement and two years later, the Board petitioned the Court of Appeals to vacate a portion of its decree on back pay and to remand it to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.320" offset="14436603">And the labor union was again was permitted to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.817" offset="14454680">And the petition of the Board was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.372" offset="14468890">The Board did not apply for certiorari but the intervening Union petitioned for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.282" offset="14500551">And in that case, in a five-to-four decision, a majority written by Mr. Justice Roberts and the minority by Mr. Justice Murphy as I remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.774" offset="14542451">But the majority said, “We think that in the circumstances disclosed, the petitioners, though they could not have instituted enforcement proceedings, had standing to seek review of their order denying the Board's petition and preceded to decide the case, but in that language which I've just quoted, this Court only cited two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.838" offset="14654673">One was Williams against Morgan, an 1884 case involving a Bondholder's Committee of purchasers having a right to seek review of an order in a mortgage-trustee compensation matter, and I don't think that helps too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.553" offset="14725622">And in the second citation after that statement is the first Amalgamated case, Consolidated Edison and where the Union came up and claimed that they were the aggrieved party and they were allowed in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.611" offset="14793853">But the record in that case shows that no one opposed the intervention of the Union and the order was signed by a single judge, so obviously there was no question in there.</text>

            <text syncTime="5949.955" offset="23903169">In other words, I'm saying that the difference between Scofield and Fafnir, illustrated by Fafnir if it were had gone the other way, makes clear that the cases are identical.</text>
