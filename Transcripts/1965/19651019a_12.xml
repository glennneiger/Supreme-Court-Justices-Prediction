            <text syncTime="31.656" offset="229961">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.314" offset="244590">My co-counsel E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr. and I represent the Western Pacific Railroad Company and its subsidiary lines, the appellants in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.369" offset="304880">This case arises under the provisions of Section 3 (4) of the interstate Commerce Act, which in part prohibits the practice of railroad rate discrimination between connecting lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.280" offset="364544">Western Pacific charges railroad appellees with such a practice against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.859" offset="394846">The map placed before the Court is an enlargement of the map which railroad appellees included in their brief herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.287" offset="436537">We hope that it may prove helpful in describing the basically simple factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.309" offset="468616">The Pacific West Coast is served generally by only two North, South Railroad routes, which are directly competitive one with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.070" offset="539669">These two routes are the Southern Pacific between Portland and Los Angeles which are shown in Brown and its connection with the Santa Fe from Stockton South to Los Angeles on one hand and the so-called, Bieber route which is made up of the purple Great Northern from Portland to Bieber, the Western Pacific in red from Bieber to the Stockton, San Francisco, Oakland Bay area and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe in green south to Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.159" offset="699956">Both routes extend between Southern California and Portland, Oregon and both routes physically connect with Railroad appellees at Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.407" offset="753037">Both routes served the same general territory in this area and all major shipping points.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.957" offset="791176">The Bieber route was under the specific authorization of the Interstate Commerce Commission completed in 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.021" offset="839450">As described, it consists now as it did then of the end-to-end connections of the three specifically described railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.215" offset="884276">Southern Pacific route was constructed first and for almost 20 years was the only north-south rail route in this territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.053" offset="939551">The construction of the Bieber route was for the declared and avowed purpose of establishing for the first time a service fully competitive with the event existing Southern Pacific route.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.855" offset="1002768">Railroad appellees which served the territory North to Portland up in Oregon, Washington and Western Idaho by establishing and maintaining a full line of through service rates with Southern Pacific via Portland while at the same time refusing to enter into similar arrangements with the Bieber route have forted and frustrated the competition between these two routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.317" offset="1136619">With the result that on all traffic moving to or from the appellee's territory, the Southern Pacific has a virtual monopoly as a practical manner than using one of the many illustrations, which appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.186" offset="1216136">If the shipper at Seattle located on the lines of Railroad appellees, make the shipment from Seattle destined to San Francisco, California and the discrimination did not exist, we would be fully competitive at Portland for the movement south from the point of common interchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.912" offset="1323029">But because of the rate discrimination, the shipment must move South of Portland on the Southern Pacific route even if it is destined to an industry served exclusively by the Western Pacific Railroad in the San Francisco area.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.758" offset="1398366">And the same situation prevails in the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.265" offset="1424384">The need for competitive service, which in 1931 required establishment of the Bieber route, is manifestly more pronounced today.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.446" offset="1485197">In January of this year, the Interstate Commerce Commission rejected the separate efforts of both Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe to take stock control of Western Pacific pointing to among other factors the critical need of Western Pacific to remain as an independent effective competitor of Southern Pacific Company with particular emphasis on its operations via the Bieber route.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.391" offset="1632946">The division -- the decision of the Commission also pointed to the relative ineffectiveness of the competition provided in this territory by other modes or forms of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.871" offset="1698879">Efforts to abate the discrimination have been unavailing because both the Commission, contrary to the findings of its hearing officer, and the lower court determined that Western Pacific was not a connecting line with appellees, because one, it is not the partner in the Bieber route which enjoys the physical connection with appellees at Portland, and in the alternative Western Pacific does not now have by grace of railroad appellees what they have classified as a business connection with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.591" offset="1881736">Both the Commission and lower court rely upon Atlantic Coast Line versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.977" offset="1911306">It is our contention that they have wholly misconstrued that case which is not only contrary to what they believe it holds, but in fact, supports the right of a carrier located as is Western Pacific here to seek and obtain relief under the provisions of Section 3 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="477.940" offset="2015169">It does not require any liberalization of the present interpretation of the term connecting lines to so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.419" offset="2057070">Not only is this so under the doctrine of Atlantic Coastline but under every other pronouncement of this Court on the subject and especially under the decision in Chicago, Indianapolis &amp; Louisville Railroad versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.328" offset="2124675">After the Commission hearing examiner in this case had heard all of the evidence first hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.674" offset="2158111">He cut through all of the extraneous argument and held for Western Pacific in what we believe are simple, clear and positive findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.429" offset="2201057">His summation at page 654 of the record herein was and I quote, "There is no justification in this record for such treatment of a connecting line.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.302" offset="2248600">The granting of a full line of rates to one railroad and an interchange point while at the same time limiting the extent of such rates to the favored lines' competitor is the essence of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.296" offset="2312547">It is the type of unlawful discrimination Section 3 (4) of the Act aims to prevent."</text>
            <text syncTime="561.765" offset="2350477">The appellant's definition of a connecting line comports with a clear legislative intent and is fully consistent with this Court's repeated their determination that and I quote from page 594 of the Chicago, Indianapolis &amp; Louisville decision, "Wherever discrimination is in fact practiced an order to remove it may issue and the order may extend to every carrier who participates in inflicting the injury."</text>
            <text syncTime="595.769" offset="2486418">That was the case which arose under Section 3 (4) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.865" offset="2506794">The appellees would not question as shown from the pleadings they have filed with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.847" offset="2530722">Western Pacific standing here as the connecting line, if appellees already joined us in through rates on a level somewhat higher than they maintain with Southern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.941" offset="2591117">Yet they seriously contend that their flat refusal to join on any level constitutes the complete defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.464" offset="2633226">That cannot be the law as Congress intended it nor as this Court has repeatedly interpreted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.830" offset="2662693">Section 3 (4) is designed to assure the shipping public of the opportunity of choice between comparable, fully available service and the decision as to which to use is properly theirs, the shipping publics and not that of the carrier which is practicing the discrimination which is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.214" offset="2760182">As covered in our briefs, the position we take is fully supported by the legislative history, the case history, and the factual and the competitive situation here prevailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.815" offset="2810650">Everyone on both sides of this case agrees that the two pivotal cases are Atlantic Coastlines and Chicago, Indianapolis &amp; Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.221" offset="2852237">We agree with the United States that Chicago, Indianapolis &amp; Louisville clearly require an end to the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.473" offset="2885256">Atlantic Coastline, we say, supports our concept of connecting lines status.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.881" offset="2910856">Just as in the instant case now before the Court, one of the complaining carriers there did not have physical connection with the line practicing the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.648" offset="2961951">At the first opportunity, the discriminating carrier took positive steps to make it clear that it was not holding out a through service with that carrier and this Court held that action to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.407" offset="3033004">The Court required the Clinchfield, which in this -- in that case was in the position of the appellees here to be maintained as a neutral carrier treating its common connecting lines equally in the matter of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.349" offset="3092773">Such neutrality would not have been possible at all if the Clinchfield had been allowed the unilateral right to determine the extent of its rate participation with these connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.682" offset="3146062">There was no requirement in that case of a pre-existing rate arrangement through the point of interchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.091" offset="3179708">The Court was clearly in interested in the arrangements which existed to the point of common interchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.292" offset="3208547">However, even had the Court than talking of an arrangement in the sense of one through the point of interchange, it was not in some technical through route sense that appellees used the term here, for the fact is that in Atlantic Coastline, there was no deliberate intentional, voluntary holding out of service by all participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.078" offset="3319724">In fact, exactly the opposite was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.659" offset="3338010">The offending carriers there were taking every possible affirmative step available to them to prevent and disavow any such holding out.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.087" offset="3383672">So therefore, properly construed, the key cases make it clear that Western Pacific position is sound and consistent with the present status of the law and that if we are determined to be a connecting line for the first time since the Bieber route was constructed, it will fulfill the purpose which the Commission and the public had in mind what it had the route constructed and that is to provide full competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.077" offset="3523688">Mr. Treanor, I understand your point that the Commission gave far too narrow a definition to the phrase "connecting line".</text>

            <text syncTime="867.096" offset="3571754">Mr. Justice Stewart, our definition would be this, if a line has a physical connection, it is obviously a connecting line.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.844" offset="3610728">In the alternative, if it is part of a route which does have a physical connection with the discriminating carrier, if that route of which it is a part is directly competitive with the favored line and if all of the participants in the route, south of point of interchange are ready, willing and able to perform the full common carrier service in conjunction with the discriminating line, then I say, it is a connecting line under the statute and the decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.585" offset="4353755">United States attempted to intervene in the proceedings before the Commission to present these views and it did not support the position if the ICC that Western Pacific was not a connecting line before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.021" offset="4411434">In our view, the Western Pacific is either a connecting line itself or part of connecting line that is a Bieber route, and the correct disposition of this case would be for the Court to remand it to the District Court for consideration of the allegations of discrimination which Western Pacific has made and which the District Court did not pass on because the District Court found Western Pacific not to be a connecting line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.861" offset="4518849">Now, as I say, we disagree with the definition of the Commission and the Court as to what a connecting line is, and I'll try to show in a few minutes, why we disagree as a technical matter of definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.541" offset="4577573">Our interest though in the case is a much more serious than a question of dry legal definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.026" offset="4603486">It's the economic impact of the Commission's decision, which we are principally concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.608" offset="4629817">We're concerned both as in our capacities as shipper that the definition be adopted in very important railroad routes between Southern California and the Northwest, and also in our sovereign capacity our interest in maintaining free competition between existing railroad routes when that competition is natural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.240" offset="4716335">We think the definition adopted does just the opposite.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.986" offset="4751339">Yes, it does and I shall address myself to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.800" offset="4774536">Let me, if I may, talk to say just a few words about the economic effect which we think the definition leads to and which we think is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.104" offset="4819780">In this case, the discrimination of the defending law of the Northern Pacific and the Union Pacific up in the Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.939" offset="4867114">Their discrimination in favor of the Southern Pacific Group essentially gives the Southern Pacific a monopoly in traffic that between all points in California, which they serve, and points on the Northwest served exclusively by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.512" offset="4933465">That is any of these cities in here, which is served only by Northern Pacific or the Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.907" offset="4958960">If you are a shipper in Los Angeles, and you want to ship to one of these cities, you would only ship on the Southern Pacific even though your plant may have equal access to the Western Pacific and therefore to the Bieber route because on the Southern Pacific, you get a joint rate which is lower than a combination rate at you pay on the Western Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.912" offset="5039000">Now, that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.359" offset="5044851">If the point to which you're shipping lies on the Great Northern as well as on the defendant roads because the Great Northern maintains joint rates both with the Southern Pacific and with the Bieber route then therefore the rates on points on cities lying on the Great Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.565" offset="5101589">If you ship via the Great Northern are equal on either route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.242" offset="5116322">But, if you see, if the city to which you're shipping, or if you're receiving goods from a producing area up here, if that city lies only on one of the defendant lines, then the Southern Pacific has a monopoly because the defendants have deliberately favored the Southern Pacific by entering into joint rates with it and not with the Bieber route carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.536" offset="5197511">We think that this definition is obviously inconsistent with the general purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.855" offset="5226768">Congress made it quite clear that that general purpose was to prohibit discrimination and all its forms, and this, it seems to us, is a very harmful type of discrimination which ought to be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.644" offset="5269922">Also, I'd like to make this point now, the definition which has been adopted is adopted solely by reference to the Atlantic Coastline's case which the Commission takes a few sentences out of the pieces together with other decisions and says they're compelled to reach the decision that Western Pacific is not a connecting line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.532" offset="5365530">The definition is not made with reference to the purposes of the Act, to the reasons run anti-discrimination provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.867" offset="5394892">It's made solely by reference to this precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.886" offset="5406908">We think that the precedence have been wrongly used by the Commission and by the Court and I think I can show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.032" offset="5431463">But it seems to us quite important that the definition here respond to the purposes of the Act and not be done in this mechanical way for piecing together a sentence from one case with a sentence from another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.690" offset="5482141">One final point is preliminary to defining the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.130" offset="5511920">Under the Commission's view of the case in the District Court, it is never suggested that there isn't a violation of Section 3 (4) in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.652" offset="5549955">That is, Section 3 (4) prohibits discrimination between connecting lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.868" offset="5570853">There's no question in this case that a connecting line is being discriminated against everyone can seem that the Northern, the Great Northern which is this purple road here, which concededly has a physical connection with the defendants at Portland is a connecting line, that's true under the narrowest possible definition of the language which would be physical connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.629" offset="5649847">So, the defendants, if the allegations of discrimination true and I think that we have to take to construe in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.197" offset="5676178">The defendants are clearly violating Section 3 (4) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.342" offset="5692792">The only question in the case as well as the Western Pacific has standing to raise the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.832" offset="5714735">There's no question as to the being in violation of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.833" offset="6474689">The term is nowhere explicitly defined in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.925" offset="6495065">As a matter of statutory language alone if you just look at the statute, it might mean just direct, physical connection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.713" offset="6546265">Even if you adopted that definition, it would still be the problem of what you meant by a line which connected with the defendant, did a line in a railroad company or did a line mean a group of railroad companies which form a unit of railroad transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.313" offset="6604675">In any case, this question of whether physical connection is the meaning of connecting lines was settled long ago in the Atlantic Coastline's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.640" offset="6645948">It was settled in that case that connecting lines that is not refer merely to physical connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.308" offset="6668622">The Court said, there is no warrant for limiting the meaning of connecting lines for those having a direct physical connection with the carriage or to discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.049" offset="6703522">The term is commonly used as referring to all the lines making up a through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.951" offset="6723166">Well, if it goes beyond the physical connection, you've got to decide how far beyond that it goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.517" offset="6753468">What we suggest as most consistent with the obvious purpose of the Act to remedy cases of discrimination is that it refers not to connecting particular railroad companies, that is railroad companies which have a physical connection with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.909" offset="6834970">But that it refers to connecting units of railroad track connecting routes, connecting functional units of railroad transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.470" offset="6869243">If you discriminate between those, it doesn't matter how many railroad companies you have making up the unit that connects, the route that connects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.557" offset="6909576">You still in violation of 3 (4) and any one of those companies along the route can invoke the section against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.033" offset="6943535">For example, if this case had been turned around exactly, suppose the defendants favored the Bieber route and discriminated against the Southern Pacific, there'd be no question of the Southern Pacific can complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.424" offset="6997034">It's a single railroad company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.336" offset="7004766">There would also be no question of the Southern Pacific could complain if the discrimination against it only applied to its bottom track near Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.124" offset="7039875">Now, supposed that they offered through rates up to San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.235" offset="7060355">But below San Francisco, they wouldn't because they were trying to favor the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe which serves between San Francisco and Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.690" offset="7090134">Although they didn't mind having the Southern Pacific competition with the Western, they didn't want it to be in competition with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.914" offset="7123048">Well, even in that case, there's no question that the Southern Pacific have used Section 3 (4), I take it the Commission has no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.325" offset="7152724">It has a physical connection up here and as a single railroad company, it goes all the way down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.983" offset="7171323">Well, if that's true, we can see absolutely no reason why the results should be any different if Southern Pacific would've divest itself of the last hundred miles of its road and to a different corporate entity, a separate corporate entity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.989" offset="8299290">We don't know why it's true that the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific's for some reason have sought to favor the Southern Pacific over the Bieber route carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.770" offset="8338474">Thereby, it's of some substantial extent destroying the Western Pacific's ability to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.790" offset="8362506">Another, Mr. Justice Fortas, another problem which is some ways as unique to this case is that you have the concededly connecting road.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.630" offset="8397928">The road which everyone concedes, connects, the Great Northern not being a plaintiff in the proceeding if it were there'd be no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.603" offset="8425827">Now, again we don't know why that is part of the several possibilities suggested so.Great Northern simply may not care enough because it shares with the Bieber route, it's too small in relation to all the rest of its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.364" offset="8472848">Western Pacific which has probably the greatest percentage-wise financial state in the Bieber route, it may be because Great Northern doesn't feel litigation worth it's while in the sense that it doesn't want to destruct it's relationships with these other roads.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.385" offset="8812962">However, in the footnote at the end of our brief, we discuss some reasons why we believe the Commission's approach to the question is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.530" offset="8841488">The Commission seems to decide the question of discrimination simply by looking at physical configuration of the routes saying that if this route is longer that one, harder than that one, there can't be any discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.095" offset="8887777">In short, we think that's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.694" offset="8898121">The question of discrimination ought to be decided with regard to the defendant road, not with regard to the Bieber route of the Southern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.347" offset="8928737">That is, they can justify not joining in through routes with the Bieber route if that hurts them, in some way, if it's more expensive for example, that the connection with the Bieber route is more expensive than the connection with the Southern Pacific or if it would harm their goodwill to do so but, merely the fact that the Bieber route is a longer route, doesn't seem to us to justify their refusal to join in through rates but at that choice whether the ship for wants to go on the longer route, the slower route, or the shorter more direct one, if that be the case here, we're not sure it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.409" offset="9045034">But, if there is that difference, that choice, we suggest should be left up to the shipper.</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.177" offset="9148061">I'd like to address myself to a note which the appellants have left with the Court of monopoly or near monopoly north of California Railroad Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.650" offset="9189961">I think they should have pointed out that Western Pacific and Great Northern provide through transportation service on rates the same level as via Portland and Southern Pacific to such major traffics under as to Northwest served by Great Northern as Portland, Seattle, Tacoma and Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.339" offset="9280763">It's far from a transportation monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.270" offset="9292466">Of course, there are local rail transportation monopolies particularly communities served by only one railroad line as there are all over the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.604" offset="9349831">Now, also in terms of monopoly this theory of connecting line is now advanced for the first time since 1887, at a time, when the railroad transportation monopoly has largely disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.400" offset="9433004">This contention might have been more plausible, 1910 and 1920 when the rail monopoly was a real thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.720" offset="10390235">The Commission and the court below held that Western Pacific is not a connecting line at Portland because a connecting line within a meaning of Section 3 (4) is one which has either a direct physical connection at the common interchange point or as one which makes up a through route through the interchange point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.783" offset="10478529">Admittedly, Western Pacific whose northern terminus at Bieber is 490 miles, railroad miles from Portland, does not physically, does not have a physical connection with Northern Pacific and Union Pacific in Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.748" offset="10546343">Commission further held that no effective through routes exist between points in California served by Western Pacific on its connections and points the Northwest on then lines of UP and Northern Pacific through Bieber and Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.244" offset="10628368">And in finding that no such through routes existed, the Commission applied this Court's definition of through route laid down in Thompson v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.509" offset="10665357">That definition is that a through route, said this Court, is an arrangement express or implied between connecting railroad for the continuous carriage of goods from the originating point on the line of one carrier to the destination on the line of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.248" offset="10740381">And it's admitted in this case that Western Pacific under the Thompson definition does not make up a through route with Northern Pacific and Union Pacific via Bieber in Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.297" offset="10812583">Its definition is, its contention is that it is an intermediate segment of a route, the so-called Bieber route, involving Santa Fe, Western Pacific and Great Northern from points in California to Portland and that the route is a connecting line within a meaning of Section 3 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.018" offset="10927417">The heart of their position is stated at page 19 of their brief, and they say there, and I quote.</text>

            <text syncTime="2732.817" offset="11034624">And indeed, it took Western Pacific 30 years since the construction of the Bieber route to discover that all this time, it had been the victim of connecting line discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.432" offset="11077151">A few other undisputed facts, Western Pacific is a wholly separate railroad corporation from Great Northern and from Santa Fe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.598" offset="11121768">It's separately managed and separately prosperous, we're not dealing with financially cripple line here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.438" offset="11229080">Looking at the language of Section 3 (4), it prohibits a railroad from practicing rate discrimination between connecting lines and it does have a definition of connecting line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.608" offset="11273801">It says as huge in this paragraph the term connecting line, means the connecting line of any carrier subject to provision of this part or any common carrier by water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.554" offset="11325628">It is the connecting line of a carrier, which is used in the singular not a string of carriers that can form a potential route.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.309" offset="11364603">It's the connecting line of a carrier, the connecting line of a water carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.491" offset="11389367">Now, we point out in our briefs that all through the Interstate Commerce Act, Congress has used the word "route".</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.889" offset="13330892">There was only characterization of it by Senator Spooner, is the only any of us either side of this case has found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.840" offset="13370702">And Senator Spooner said the principle embodied in it was long ago imposed on a qualified way upon the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific Companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.436" offset="13413125">We can only figure this out as a reference to the Pacific Railroad Acts which has this Court as recognized required Union Pacific and Central Pacific to be operated as a single line, and to avoid any form of discrimination against each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.360" offset="13484805">So and of course those two lines were intend to and did physically connect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.709" offset="13510196">So, the only clue we have as to the urge in the connecting line provision, it's not conclusive but it's the only thing we have is an illusion to the situation of two railroads Union Pacific and Central Pacific which did in fact physically connect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.869" offset="13590862">Now, under the definition of connecting line proffered of by the Department of Justice, New Haven or Boston and Maine is one of Your Honors indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.665" offset="13642062">Either one can assert a reasonably direct line potential route via New York Central, Burlington and Rio Grande or Union Pacific, the tie-up to be in connection with the Western Pacific at Salt Lake City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.067" offset="13715623">Now, just as Seattle shies away from the implications of that, that Boston and Maine can exert a compulsion to participate routes in it from coast to coast, merely as being an element and a potential route and still claim connecting lines fixed, so just to suggest as this qualification that all the intervening participants must be willing to participate, but it seems to me that that presents anomalies too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.722" offset="13842265">If such a string of carriers is a route which Congress intended to protect as a connecting line, illogical is it to suggest that any participant along the route can cut off the connecting line rights of anybody behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.125" offset="13923871">I would like to turn to discuss briefly this Court's decision relied upon by the appellants as dispositive, the Atlantic Coastline decision decided by this Court in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.634" offset="13989909">Your Honors will recall, the Commission held at Western Pacific was not a connecting line with the Northern Pacific and Union Pacific at Portland, because it didn't have a direct physical connection with them, and secondly, because it did not participate with Northern Pacific and Union Pacific in through routes via and through Portland as defined by this Court in the Thompson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.220" offset="14108296">Both Western Pacific and the Department now contend that Western Pacific enjoys connecting lines status with Northern Pacific and Union Pacific at Portland, because they participate, because Western Pacific and Great Northern participate in a through route up to Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.023" offset="14195440">They said that's enough to make them a connecting line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.244" offset="14208397">And they say that this flows from this Court's decision in the Atlantic Coastline case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.241" offset="14232325">To begin with, the Atlantic Coastline case didn't involve Section 3 (4) at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.089" offset="14251760">It involved the interpretation and application of conditions which the Commission imposed in authorizing Atlantic Coastline and Louisville, Nashville to lease the Clinchfield line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.373" offset="14304841">And they threw in a condition the protected condition requiring that the Clinchfield be kept open equally available to such carriers now connecting or which may hereafter connect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.955" offset="14359176">And through traffic they desire to participate in through traffic between the Ohio River and points north and southeastern territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.055" offset="14403584">And after approval of the lease, coastlines sought to cancel a lot of joint rates and which paid Piedmont and Georgia &amp; Florida, two small carriers had been participating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.907" offset="14467009">And the Commission required them to continue these rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.165" offset="14491982">Now, as this act -- had been sustaining this action of the Commission that this Court stated, the argument is that the Georgia &amp; Florida does not connect since its own rails do not physically abut on the Clinchfield rails, the connection being made over the Piedmont and northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.146" offset="14560005">There is no warrant from limiting, said this Court, the meeting of connecting lines to those having a direct physical connection with Clinchfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.115" offset="14591875">The term is commonly used a referring to all the lines making up a through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.254" offset="14624371">The appellants, the Department say, that this language supports the proposition that connecting line includes all carriers who are willing to participate in through transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.476" offset="14673272">They need not already have participated with the defendants in this case Northern Pacific and UP and Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.062" offset="14719666">Their reliance on this Court's Atlantic Coastline decision is wholly fallacious for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.780" offset="14746520">As the three-judge court and the Atlantic Coastline case recognized the joint rates which the Commission ordered continued involved the participation of the two complaining carriers Georgia &amp; Florida and Piedmont in through routes going way beyond the interchange points to points up in the Ohio and north of the Ohio River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.062" offset="14839620">They were not routes up to the interchange point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.160" offset="14856025">Secondly, looking -- treating Atlantic Coastline as a Section 3 (4) four case, at every stage in the Atlantic Coastline litigation before the Commission and the courts, among the complainants was Piedmont which was the directing connect -- the direct physically connecting line in the position of Great Northern in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.070" offset="14959679">Piedmont as a connecting line would be entitled to nondiscriminatory rate treatment on through traffic as well as local traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.741" offset="14990294">And as both the United States and the Commission pointed out in the Atlantic Coastline case in their joint brief, the fact that Piedmont was a connection and was entitled to nondiscriminatory treatment on through traffic, that that pretty much carried Georgia &amp; Florida in this case Western Pacific along for free, that nothing in the facts before this Court in Atlantic Coastline, is inconsistent with the way the Commission applied this Court's later definition of through route from the Thompson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.701" offset="15146193">And nothing and what this Court actually decided, supports the definition of a connecting line which they now uniquely and in the first time in 75 years urge.</text>

            <text syncTime="4792.599" offset="19273749">Under the existing rates the shipment would come north on the Great Northern to Wishram shown here on the map and would then move directly east to Spokane.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.397" offset="19308962">Assuming it's moving east out the Cascade Mountains, under what is thought by the appellants that shipment would come to Wishram then go west to Vancouver, Washington, fence down into Portland which point would be interchanged to the Union Pacific or Northern Pacific and then on to its destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.308" offset="19372596">Security back home of in excess 200 miles in through there, by in transit our service would be a day slower in eastern Washington than would be the service of the -- than would be our existing service at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.496" offset="19433305">It would be two days slower than the existing service of the Great Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.423" offset="19461099">Our routes, both of them serve Oregon, 246 miles to Portland but their contention is we should not get this traffic until it gets to Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.209" offset="19496208">More than that, the traffic from Bieber on north would be handled by a line that competes, if these destinations in these points both with the Union Pacific and Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.458" offset="19541243">These way bills would be available to them and they could say, "Well now why should you use Union Pacific, or why should you use Northern Pacific service form Portland?</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.269" offset="19572485">Why goodness sakes, you routed via us we'll need two days faster.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.718" offset="19586278">We don't have to go this roundabout route down at the Portland we go directly down to Wishram and then south so our service is far better."</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.874" offset="19622849">And so not only would we lose traffic moving north and south but shippers will say, "Well if that's typical of the service being offered by Northern Pacific or Union Pacific may be we ought to get somebody else to handle our traffic to other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.378" offset="19672900">And we ask you then, we say the -- when the Commission has full power to establish whatever reasonable routes are required and when they have specifically found that additional routes are not required here which remains unchallenged, we ask the Court not to take the term "connecting line" and read the adjective connecting out of it and to make it so inclusive that will embrace any road of the country to provide them with relief when full relief could be accorded assuming there was any public need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.101" offset="19799751">And we think the statutory history and we think the cases fully support the established construction of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4960.951" offset="19947186">Addressing myself Mr. Chief Justice to the second part of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.738" offset="19962337">First, I like to say that I take a position directly contrary to what they say and say that is to say that it is the standard practice in the railroad industry to encourage as many outlets as possible for your traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.006" offset="20015417">And if you connect with more than one carrier that your own interest and the practice in the industry ever since I've been associated with the industry has been, that railroads do not discourage additional outlets to their traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.087" offset="20083754">And I think that while it is true that there are very few cases which have hit this issue directly, I think Atlantic Coastline hits the issue directly and I think that Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville which involves Section 3 (4), although it involved that interchange facility Section of 3 (4) did deal with the question of connecting lines status and did hit head on the two question which we have here whether you need a physical connection and secondly whether you need in lieu thereof the prior existence of through service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.667" offset="20218023">And Mr. Justice Brandeis, in his opinion, hit both those issues squarely in Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="5035.107" offset="20243832">But I do agree that while there have been very few cases on this subject, I think that the explanation is not what they have suggested to you but really because the industry itself simply does not tie its hand in a number of connection and equal treatment which its connections.</text>
