            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="2.713" offset="114186">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.790" offset="130487">Let me begin at the end and say a word first about the appropriate remedy as we view it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.694" offset="162147">For our part, we have some doubt whether this Court may properly require the Georgia courts to refuse to accept the resignation of the city and to enjoin those courts from appointing substitute trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.101" offset="223796">The appropriate ruling here, we think is the Baconsfield so long as it remains essentially a public park and no matter who the trustee is, no matter who the Board manages maybe cannot exclude Negroes as such consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.951" offset="319195">Now that is not a request for an advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.631" offset="333928">All the pleadings in this case and the rulings of the Georgia courts are expressly premised on the assumption that private trustees, unlike the city, will be able to effectuate the test status discriminatory purpose which the city admittedly cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.313" offset="412609">Accordingly, the appropriate disposition here it seems to us, if the Court accepts our argument on the merits, is for the Court to declare that the park, no matter by whom it ministered, cannot be operated on a racially discriminatory basis, yo vacate the judgment below, because it is based on an incorrect premise and to remand the case to the judge of course, first affording the city an opportunity to withdraw its resignation in light of the ruling that that resignation is ineffective insofar as it permits the effectuation of the trustee's racial restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.756" offset="582405">If the city should choose not to withdraw that resignation, then the remand to afford the Georgia courts an opportunity to determine as a matter of local law whether a resignation as it were without cause, a pointless resignation, is or should be accepted a new trustee's appointment.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.417" offset="693060">Do you think that anything this Court can or should do to prevent the property reverting to the senator's heirs?</text>

            <text syncTime="159.568" offset="741648">Mr. Justice Stewart, we take no position on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.311" offset="756590">We do not think it's before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.597" offset="765785">We do not think the judgment we suggest would have any effect on that question which clearly expressly too was not passed on by the judge of courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.647" offset="801938">The request of the heirs that the property be reverted to them in the event the restriction could not be carried out was not ruled on below and it seems to us cannot be ruled on here.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.895" offset="850944">Mr. Claiborne, if I correctly understand your position, you're asking for a relief beyond that that the petitioner is asking here and you're really asking for a relief which would in effect invalidate the racial restriction in the will?</text>

            <text syncTime="213.527" offset="957524">Mr. Justice Fortas, in their pleadings below, the petitioners did ask that the racial restriction be stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.633" offset="985945">They also asked that the cy-pres doctrine be applied by striking that racial restriction and effectuating what they view is the primary purpose of testator retained the city as trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.052" offset="1043623">Here as I understand it, the petitioners are at least alternatively arguing for the same ruling that we think is appropriate.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="243.624" offset="1077896">But perhaps I misunderstood, Mr. Greenberg yesterday but as I listened to him, I thought that his position was that what this Court -- he was asking this Court to invalidate the city's resignation and the appointment of private trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.654" offset="1162010">Perhaps, I was wrong about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.784" offset="1170474">Now as I understand it, what you're asking us to do is -- goes far beyond that and to decide that the park cannot be operated on a discriminatory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.452" offset="1229197">And the question that I'm asking you is whether the net affect of that is not to invalidate the racial covenant in the will which would mean perhaps I'd like to comment on this that the question of a reversion of a property to the heirs would be academic because the net effect would be that the racial covenant would be invalidated and therefore, it would perhaps -- the result would be that there would be no reason, no occasion, no basis for a reversion of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.799" offset="1410591">Mr. Justice Fortas, we don't view the ruling we suggest here as having any such effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.783" offset="1434520">We simply say that the Court should declare that so long as the park remains essentially a public park, it cannot discriminate on the ground of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.600" offset="1485824">We do not say that the heirs have no right to reversion if this condition in the will is unenforceable.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.428" offset="1601076">I will do that, Mr. Justice Fortas but as we view the reversion to the heirs, it would then cease to be a property dedicated to public uses in perpetuity, would then become the private property of the heirs to do with as they chose to use for business purposes, to subdivide as housing or otherwise to use it in nonpublic way.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="398.766" offset="1698461">Well what you're doing is suggesting a different form of words but essentially the same result is that -- is that wrong, that is to say that the net effect of the relief that I understood Mr. Greenberg would be asking was that the effort by the city to convert this into some sort of a privately managed park would be invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.328" offset="1824684">Then it would be up to the state court to determine whether that invalidates the request to advice in the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.043" offset="1883512">And then the Court would have to determine whether it reverts to the private persons and the private heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.254" offset="1920397">And as I understand you now, you're saying exactly the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.412" offset="1937011">It does come to the same thing, Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.393" offset="1948923">However, we have -- we simply have doubt whether the appropriate remedy is to direct the Georgia courts to refuse his resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.416" offset="1981001">For all we know, Georgia law would permit the city to resign without cause and if that is so, there is no federal question involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.691" offset="2030111">If on the other hand Georgia law only permits a resignation for cause and that cause is constitutionally prohibited, then perhaps the proper solution is to bar the substitution of trustees.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="498.367" offset="2096880">Well I hope you'll forgive for taking so much of your time but what is the trouble with the -- that you have with the direct approach or what seems to the petitioner at any rate I assume would be the direct approach, that is to say that the -- just to this Court to consider holding that a city is attempting to evade a constitutional duty, the constitutional duty being to operate this public facility on a – on a non-segregated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.193" offset="2248182">Of course, there are a lot of problems implicit in that but it seems to me that -- that was the representation that they were making to this Court as appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.050" offset="2307532">I take it that you have some questions as to the power of this Court to do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="556.280" offset="2328534">We agree that the effort of the city to perpetuate segregation through its resignation if -- if that should maybe properly so viewed is an ingredient in this case, a meaningful one.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.505" offset="2381406">On the other hand, if the law of Georgia be that the city can resign for no cause then it seems to us perhaps irrelevant that their clause in this case was the bad one.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.542" offset="2441592">But our primary point is that a public park, no matter by whom operated cannot stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, that racial restriction in such park cannot stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.975" offset="7775274">Your Honors, I approach this case, arguing for the respondent essentially from the premise that what we are looking for is what can fail and be found as state action in connection with the facts of this case as disclosed by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.516" offset="7893452">Accordingly, it occurs to me since there is no suggestion made and certainly no suggestion which could reasonably be made that the Court has jurisdiction except in the event of an element of state involvement that the critical and important question which we are ultimately trying to decide is just where that state involvement is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.144" offset="8019989">And that can only be determined by a critical, accurate, and rather complete examination of the facts of the case as disclosed by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.963" offset="8075264">Now the most vital and in fact the only document which is involved which does have the elements of a contract is of course the will of Senator Bacon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.113" offset="8127822">And it seems to me that the first thing I would like to approach is that which is suggested by Mr. Claiborne's opening remarks in which he places emphasis upon the fact that this was a public place equating it I suppose in some sense to governmental operations and I have assumed that that contention having full made was more less based upon inferences that might be drawn from the Marsh versus Alabama decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.787" offset="8278497">There is of course a vital difference there and irrespective of Marsh, it maybe that viewing a public park in the charitable sense, simply by itself and without relation doing a precedent, it maybe that this Court would reach the same conclusion here that they did in Marsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.804" offset="8378598">But of course, the Court is entirely aware that in the Marsh case, we were dealing with a community which I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter in a concurring opinion, stated to be a town as might so as in the other town that is slangily expressed by me, a town is a town and that is that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.443" offset="8489148">But in the Marsh case, the language in the majority opinion clearly discloses the broad ambit of community life which was carried on there with shops, [Inaudible] building run into the post office department were used by the United States government, the delivery of mail involving so far a -- the -- the complete orbit of community life as to constitute it a governmental operation in the same sense that a town chartered by the State would be so considered.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank C. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="4835.400" offset="19445008">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.947" offset="19459114">In view of the several questions that have been asked about the Girard litigation and also because of the fact that it was referred to by the Supreme Court of Georgia and has been felt throughout this litigation to be of significance, I would like to comment briefly about the further proceedings in particular that took place following the 1957 decision by this Court in the first Girard case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.274" offset="19560469">Your Honors recall of course that Mr. Girard died in 1831 living the sum of $2 million in trust for a college for four male White orphans that the college was subsequently established in 1948 that the City of Philadelphia first served as trustee but subsequently, the Pennsylvania legislature created a Board of City Trust which in 1869 succeeded to that function and served thereafter continuously until the time of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.471" offset="19685230">Also that that Board included the Mayor of Philadelphia, the president of City Council and various private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.688" offset="19714173">After this Court held in 1957, that the application of two Negro orphans who were otherwise fully qualified could not be denied solely because of race with the Board as a city agency serving as trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.254" offset="19784391">It was then amended by this Court for further proceedings below not inconsistent with that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.514" offset="19809468">I would like to deviate at that point and make the observation that prior to the case reaching this Court in 1957 the part had been made very strongly both in the Orphans' Court of Philadelphia where the litigation originated and later in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that in the event that it was ruled that the Board of City Trust could not continue constitutionally to carry out the intention manifested in Girard will that then would become necessary that substituted trustees be appointed for that purpose, so that that contention was a -- a question which existed in the litigation almost from the very outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.555" offset="19957635">Following the remand by this Court, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania then remanded the case to the orphans' court also for further proceedings not inconsistent with that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.607" offset="19997759">The Court will recall that the orphans' court after delay of some two months, removed the Board of City Trust as trustee and appointed as substituted to trustees 13 private persons, six of them incidentally had up until that time served on the Board of City Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.928" offset="20075081">It dismissed the application of the two Negro orphans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.517" offset="20093471">Both the city and the State Pennsylvania and the applicants then appealed to the Supreme Court Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.972" offset="20119280">Our view of the briefs that were filed in that litigation has impressed us very much that virtually, every contention which is made in the present litigation was made in a most forceful amount in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.778" offset="20174451">Now that court ruled that Steven Girard had a constitutional right of property in the execution of his testamentary benefaction that the trust was a private one, that the orphans' court had the inherent power to remove the trustee and that there was not discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5035.339" offset="20244773">We attach considerable significance subsequently ruling by this Court in denying the appeal and in dismissing the appeal and denying the application for certiorari for several reasons, among the them being that the matter of substituted trustees have been an extremely important consideration from the very outset of litigation and particularly of course in the orphans' court and in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.987" offset="20355323">It's seems to us Your Honor that the conclusion by this Court that there was not such a case that would justify further review on certiorari was widely interpreted at the time and certainly it seems to us by the Supreme Court of Georgia in this case as being most significant decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.282" offset="20448528">Again, I would point out to this Court that almost to every contention that was made in the present case at any stage of litigation was made in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and in the record that came to this case in second Girard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.401" offset="20500982">It was contended for example that Girard's primary object was trusteeship by the city rather than the establishment of a college for four male White orphans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.799" offset="20542568">That contention was rejected in the very extensive decision by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.905" offset="20567019">We would point out that in the present case this deals with one point that was raised earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.838" offset="20590738">That there is the use of language in item nine of Senator Bacon's will, following the naming of the Mayor and Council or their successors and trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.667" offset="20630026">There is a provision to the effect that in the event that the city could not serve as trustee that the city would be authorize to a point a trustee, presumably a private person to function in that capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.437" offset="20685093">The fact that a designation of the body to appoint, the initial Board of Managers and the approval of subsequent nominees for that office was designated as the Mayor and Council and then the language or their successors powers, certainly illustrates to us that the word successors were not necessary as referring to the Mayor and Council because that was the correct corporate name of the City of Macon at that time and certainly manifested the intention or contemplation on the part of the testator that a trustee other than the City of Macon might serve in that capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.640" offset="20833886">The point was also made most forcefully in that litigation that after a 126 years of exceedingly active state and city participation in the administration of the trust, the Girard College had become a public institution so that even if the board of trust should be replaced as trustee, it remained such a public institution as would cause the Fourteen Amendment to continue to be applicable and to forbid discrimination in carrying out the testimator's scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="5427.413" offset="21813060">I would make the observation; first of all, that that's customarily language are used in Georgia trust instruments and secondly, the language and to their successors forever is capable of either of two constructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.671" offset="21870007">First of all, the particular persons who might succeed as the Mayor and the members of Council or to whoever might say other than the Mayor and Council as trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.920" offset="21915042">And it seems to me that then the further reference in that same item to -- or to their successors and the particular reference in item 10 to the selection by the city itself of a successor trustee makes clear that Senator Bacon definitely contemplated the possibility that someone other than the Mayor and Council might serve in that capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.822" offset="22014621">Your Honor, I was making that point that in the Girard litigation, the second Girard case both in the courts of Pennsylvania and in the record in this Court, the point was made most forcefully that because of 126 years of active operation and administration by the city and state, the growth of the $2 million fund to a $100 million, the growth of the college saw that there was an enrollment of over 1000 and all of the many facets of state and -- city and state relationship including the existence of some five different Pennsylvania statutes on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.373" offset="22156831">The Girard College had become a public institution and that the mere replacement of the trustee could not change its essentially public character.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.112" offset="22195806">That contention was rejected most forcefully by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.795" offset="22218585">The point was made that merely because they had been put on in a skillful management of the trust by the Board of Trust will not change its essential character that it was created as a private charity although it had certain public characteristics of course and that it remained so and despite the fact of that statutory or framework which had come in to existence in the other matters which it mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.092" offset="22319731">Again, I would deviate at this point to make the point which we feel is most important that the degree of city and state connection with Baconsfield park has been exceedingly limited, far less significant and existed in Girard case, really being confined as we see it to first of all, the meaning of the city as the naked legal trustee and secondly to giving the right to the city initially to name the Board of Managers and subsequently to approve nominations to the Board with no further rights and when the City of Macon resigned as trustee, as we see it, there was a complete severance of any further city or state connection in the relationship with Baconsfield Park.</text>

            <text syncTime="5849.752" offset="23502346">It seems to me that that is the reason why the denial of certiorari carried unusual significance as far as its interpretation is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.621" offset="23549889">Your Honor, I believe my time is up and I would say simply in conclusion that we believe that there is such a total lack of state involvement following the resignation of the city which was accepted as a matter of state law as we interpret the Supreme Court of Georgia decision that there is no reason why the provisions of Senator Bacon's will could not be carried out as a private charity.</text>

            <text syncTime="5945.414" offset="23884988">This charitable trust has been endowed by the State of Georgia with a quality that private property transactions normally don't possess.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.376" offset="23924903">The Congress of the United States has passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the nation has acquiesced in this and has endorsed it and then there has been the Civil Rights Act of 1965 and I imagine the time that will not be far from now in the State of Georgia and the City of Macon may have comparable legislation and indeed may have a comparable spirit among the people which won't require any legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.625" offset="24013824">And if this were a private property transaction or these merely were a private trust in time, the dead-hand of the testator would be removed from it and people would change their minds and local and national laws perhaps could be able to affect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.657" offset="24077981">But we have here a situation in which when everything else has changed in the City of Macon both in law and in the hearts of the people, the dead-hand of this testator will remain in Baconsfield if the contentions of the respondents are right will forever remain a segregated park ultimately by operation of the law of charitable trust of the State of Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="6140.034" offset="24663542">This of course is -- is not merely a question of the charitable trust because here we were faced with the situation in which the senator had two incompatible irreconcilable desires set forth in his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="6152.581" offset="24713697">On the one hand, he wanted public trusteeship and that was very clear, that was just not a fleeting thought that he had and said, gee, you know, perhaps we ought to have a public trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6163.069" offset="24755597">He set this forth a number of times as to the realty, as to the personality and then if the city by its charter and he had this in mind, fit the city by a charter or unable to serve the city would then appoint the private trustee or some other trustee and then not merely appoint it but the city council who laid down rules and regulations under which this new trustee would function, so public control is a matter of very great concern to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6186.726" offset="24850265">And if on the one hand we have this deep interest in public control and in the other hand we have this deep concern for racial segregation, the Court was not enforcing the private will of the testator, it was making a choice between two incompatible wills and that was the action of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6205.132" offset="24923930">This is quite unlike Shelley against Kraemer where there was just a single univalent will of a -- of a -- of a property owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6212.002" offset="24951411">This was a case in which there were two incompatible wills and indeed the will to segregate was infected by the state action legislation that Section 69-504 that I talked about a great deal yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="6227.596" offset="25013791">So how this can be viewed as a simple, private property matter in which a living person does something with the part of land that he owns during his lifetime without regard to the state either controlling it forever into all time or without regard to the state influencing him or selecting racial segregation as against another equally strongly expressed desire escapes to me.
