            <label>Ms. Doris H. Maier</label>
            <text syncTime="697.293" offset="2892570">Well, under the exemption provision of the federal statute that is too big.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.415" offset="2917021">The term “taxation” shall include but not be limited to licensees' fees or excises imposed in respect to motor vehicles with their use thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.841" offset="2958712">Now, regardless to the category of tax that before within that but our -- our disagreement with the state -- the Supreme Court of the State of California has been based in their interpretation of the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.943" offset="3035094">They have read it so that unless the charge is actually levied on the respondent, he would be not subject to the charge of the state in which he was stationed.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.027" offset="3127463">We believe that this interpretation of the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act is erroneous that Congress did not intend to exempt servicemen from the payment of registration and license fees all over the United States, because, virtually all of the motor vehicle provisions in there -- of the various states are depended on the use of the highway and that the fee only comes actually into force when the use is made of the particular highway of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.811" offset="3302588">And therefore, we say that Congress when it enacted this proviso was well aware of this provision and the provisions of this state statutes only met to exempt servicemen who were -- had already paid the motor vehicle fee charged in the resident state.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.859" offset="3406764">Under our interpretation, the term “required” as used in the Act means that this established or charged by the resident state.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.771" offset="3450441">The fact that the Washington statute provided that the motor vehicle fees were not payable until the vehicle was operated upon the state's highways, we say, does not compel a contrary view.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.988" offset="3503313">For vehicle fees generally are considered a privilege tax and not due and payable until the vehicle was operating within the taxing state.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.483" offset="3537272">The statute in the various states had been set forth in Appendix A to petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.136" offset="3563917">We believe that Whiting versus the City of Portsmouth the Virginia case, it has reasoning that it's applicable to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.280" offset="3604459">In that case, the servicemen stationed in Virginia was a resident in Colorado, purchased a car in Virginia, paid his registration and license fees in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.518" offset="3649494">He claimed exemption from the City of Portsmouth's tax which taxed the motor vehicle operating, kept and use in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.804" offset="3682617">The Court there held that the imposition of the Portsmouth tax was proper since he had not paid the taxes levied by his home State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.593" offset="3725772">Subsequent to this case, Congress did amend, Section 574 of the Soldiers and Sailor's Relief Act but did not in any way change the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.193" offset="3776136">Therefore, we plea that under the general provisions of statutory construction it may be presumed that Congress was aware of the judicial decision and intended to leave that construction of statute the unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.643" offset="3841964">We would call the attention of this Court to the fact that the California Supreme Court's decision would place in virtually impossible burden on the administrative agencies whose duty is to carry out these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.566" offset="3913644">The administrative agency would have to determine in the case of each serviceman what the law of his home state requires and whether he had complied with that prior to granting or denying an exemption from the California statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.040" offset="4011551">We submit that this should be replaced by what we believe was the -- an objective standard adopted by Congress namely whether he had paid the tax in his home state or license in his home state prior to being exempted by the state in which he was stationed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.378" offset="4112906">The decision of the California Supreme Court would further render effective, motor vehicle registration statutes because we would have no provision for a serviceman registering and paying his fees if he did not have to pay in the state where he was stationed where perhaps he would not go back to his home state and operate his vehicle on the roads of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.223" offset="4236309">Safety dictates that motor vehicles should be registered for purposes of proper identification in case of accidents or injuries to occupants and also in order to protect innocent purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.005" offset="4303391">If a car is ineffectively licensed, it is not only tempting to car theft, thief but becomes a public hazard in case of an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.667" offset="4349994">We submit that it was not the intent of Congress to completely eliminate servicemen from liability for fees for the use of the highways of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.912" offset="4411016">The problems presented by the respondent that the servicemen would encounter if he were subject to tax of states are not correctly set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.886" offset="4494921">Petitioner, respondent, pardon me, in this case had he pay the license and tax charged by his home state, would have been exempt from the provisions of all other state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.447" offset="4581125">He then would have a necessary license and been able to travel throughout the states without the problems here presented arising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.276" offset="4636505">Also, a temporary as the respondent has raised the question of the burden that might be placed on the servicemen going through numerous states that each state would levy a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.127" offset="4695855">This is not correct, because each state has a provision for the temporary use of its highways without the payment of any fees by nonresident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.967" offset="4747264">We request that this Court should reverse the decision of the California Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.036" offset="4823542">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.347" offset="4860740">The posture of this case is such that I don't believe the Court can reach the issue under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act from which the ruling assault by the people of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.328" offset="4916642">I must respectfully submit from an examination of the record that the writ of certiorari was improvidently sold and that there are jurisdictional reasons why no full examination of the Soldiers and Sailor's Relief Act can be reached in the case as it now stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.348" offset="5004727">An explanation of the jurisdictional problem requires me to touch very briefly on the Structure's Statute law in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.342" offset="5044746">David Dudley Field, as we all know, pioneer to New York Civil Practice Act in 1848, the first of the reformed codes, his brother Steven Field, Mr. Justice Field later of this Court was equally interested in the issue of law reform and the two brothers together had drawn a code of substantive procedure which New York wouldn't adopt and California did adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.028" offset="5183509">California adopted four codes as the Chief Justice knows and I'm going to go into this very briefly because it may not be submitted to the other members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.607" offset="5225827">California adopted four separate codes of 1872, the Code of Civil Procedure based largely in New York, the Civil Code, the Probate Code and the Political Code, now they were always separate, they were always autonomous and those four codes are today 25 separate and autonomous codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.400" offset="5321017">One of them is the Vehicle Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.346" offset="5332720">The California Vehicle Code is adopted in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.125" offset="5351842">The statute creating it is entitled “An Act to Establish a Vehicle Code” thereby consolidating and revising a law relating to vehicles and vehicular traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.912" offset="5403042">California has a separate code called “The Revenue and Taxation Code”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.372" offset="5428851">It was enacted and adopted as an entirely separate feature of California's Code law of its statutory structure in 1939 and Section 1 of that code states as follows, this Act shall be known as the Revenue and Taxation Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.152" offset="5512025">Now, the essence of this case in the posture and which this Court may find is this, that the Vehicle Code provides in Section 9250 for a registration fee, a registration fee of $8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.524" offset="5561448">“A registration fee of $8 shall be paid to department, that's the Department of Motor Vehicles for the registration of every vehicle of a type subject to registration.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.722" offset="5626232">And the vehicle go -- code goes further in Section 4850 and issues a mandatory demand on the Department of Motor Vehicles have said this, the department upon registering a vehicle shall issue to the owner to suitable license plates or devices for motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.702" offset="5706167">The plates or devices shall identify the vehicle for which they're issued for the period of their validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.210" offset="5732185">Now, that's a very different thing from which the learned and gracious lady who appears here for the State of California has been talking about when she expresses and the Attorney General of California expresses such great concern that there might have been an unlicensed and unregistered vehicle, a vehicle not properly identified with what we come and we referred to as license or registration plates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.268" offset="5836466">There is an $8 registration fee under this first statute in the Vehicle Code, there is an expressed mandatory order to the Department of Motor Vehicles of when that $8 is paid, license plates shall then be issued the type that we're familiar with, two of them to be put on the front of the and back of the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.653" offset="5913997">Now, Captain Buzard, a pilot in the strategic air command who according to a quick quote that I made this morning has been stationed in about 10 different bases at Lackland at San Antonio, at Castle, at Randolph and who now contrary to what I am certain as the inadvertent expression in the briefs of the Attorney General of California is not permanently stationed in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.989" offset="6039280">He isn't -- he is now flying a strategic Air Force airplane out of an Air Force base in Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.091" offset="6075747">Captain Buzard was tried under Section 4000 of the Vehicle Code, that's the jurisdictional posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.478" offset="6109288">That's the case as it comes before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.054" offset="6127574">Section 4000 states this, “no person shall drive, move or leave standing any motor vehicle, trailer, semi-trailer, pole or pipe dolly or auxiliary dolly upon a highway unless it is registered and the appropriate fees have been paid under this code”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.560" offset="6213569">Those are the three keywords, those are the reasons why I have to respectively suggest to the Court that I think the writ of certiorari was improvidently applied for by the Attorney General of the State of California because the in lieu taxes to which the Chief Justice made reference, the 2% tax which would've amounted here to some hundred dollars are at in no place referred to in the California Vehicle Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.785" offset="6326523">They are only in the Revenue and Taxation Code and their ad valorem quality is, I respectfully submit, adequately demonstrated by the fact that the name of the code and which there appear is called Revenue and Taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.142" offset="6379917">They say, Section 10751 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, a license fee is hereby imposed for the privilege of operating on the public highways of the state, any vehicle of type which is subject to registration under the Vehicle Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.117" offset="6439790">The annual amount of the license fee shall be a sum equal to 2% of the market value of the vehicle as determined by the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.485" offset="6469360">Let me stop right there and interpolate if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.498" offset="6489318">This captain was from Washington, he was born in Washington and like most of us when he had a chance he went home to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.581" offset="6525680">He had -- he had driven not on product of his own but under orders from Castle Air Force Base down to Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.542" offset="6569566">The record reveals he had driven a car down there, a car with Washington license plates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.370" offset="6588897">Well, that was in September, the Court convict judicial notice that the new cars were coming on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.634" offset="6613870">He had a chance to buy a demonstrator which had belonged to a dealer in Alabama license tax zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.276" offset="6644485">He was so careful, has even get himself in Alabama driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.290" offset="6668518">He came December the 19th, his temporary duty of almost four months expired and he drove himself his automobile with his wife back to his wife's family somewhere in the Midwest and arrived back in California on New Year's eve, New Year's eve of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.815" offset="6750647">On the 26th day of February less than two months later, there was a roadblock right outside Castle Air Force Base, near Merced -- Merced County, California, Captain Buzard was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.466" offset="6801220">This controversy grew out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.390" offset="6812923">The point I want to make is that that summer he went home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.975" offset="6835284">When he went home, he paid the Washington tax, he got himself properly -- the -- the proper fees were paid in the State of Washington, payment of them in California would in no way have immunized him from the fee -- from proper fees in Washington because under Section 574, it's only the payment of the taxes and enormously restate that immunized taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.740" offset="6938311">So, if he had to pay that 2% of that 1959 automobile to California then the very second that this officer got home, the same year he had to pay it again and that looks -- may it please the Court, it looks very suspiciously like triple taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.377" offset="7780916">But the only provision under Vehicle Code about license plates is Section 4850 and the only provision for the payment of fees is Section 9250 and the only fee is $8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.999" offset="7835355">There is nothing in the Vehicle Code about the 2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.795" offset="7850506">Now, this case has an earlier history which I think buys the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.593" offset="7881749">Mr. Robinson, counsel for Captain Buzard in California sought a writ of prohibition, sought prerogative relief from the District Court of Appeal in California to prevent this prosecution for a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.048" offset="7943607">He was not successful in that prerogative writ proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.946" offset="7959176">The District Court of Appeal denied that saying the case should be tried and that it might appear when the case was tried that the man could've paid the registration fee, that it didn't sufficiently appear in the prerogative writ proceedings that he had tried to pay the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.056" offset="8031587">So, that opinion I think came down in January of ‘62 and this trial thereafter proceeded, but in its opinion, the California District Court of Appeal and this is itself a final opinion and on this point a final exposition of California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.738" offset="8106297">The California District Court of Appeal in the case of Buzard against Justice Court said actually vehicle license fees are fixed by the Revenue and Taxation Code, Sections 10751, et seq.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.760" offset="8158438">Furthermore, it is not the purpose of Vehicle Code Section 4000 to fix or collect the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.703" offset="8182157">The registration of motor vehicles operate within the state is required for the purpose of protecting innocent purchasers against fraud, to provide identification of responsible persons in case of a vehicular accident and as a deterrent vehicle theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.265" offset="8236387">And the Court went on to say this, “The registration statute has an entirely different purpose from the license fee statute and it is clearly severable from them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.128" offset="8279855">Now, that as to that point, there is a very considerable clash between myself and the Attorney General for the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.293" offset="8316531">The Attorney General's position is that you have to pay the excise tax or the privilege tax or the ad valorem tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.226" offset="8340250">We come and we refer to it as an in lieu tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.579" offset="8349654">Before you can register the car, if Your Honors please, the contrary is the fact, the Buzard case so establishes and so does the case of -- from which the present proceeding is on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.056" offset="8415587">Now, counsel representing the State of Mississippi said they might have to be forced to the same sort of thing that have been done here for the State of California, that is criminal proceedings and he thereby pointed out something that distinguished this case, it makes it different from all the others that have been before the Court or that are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.057" offset="8495626">This is a criminal case, an Air Force captain has -- had a criminal complaint filed against him and has been fined $50.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.631" offset="8533870">He was suspended for six months on his good behavior but it's a very serious thing on an Air Force career officer's record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.524" offset="8581517">The record in this case shows that he has been on active duty except for one year since 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.442" offset="8621119">It's a criminal case bottomed on Section 4000 of the Criminal Code -- 4000 of the Vehicle Code the narrow issue is whether there was any evidence to sustain the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.983" offset="8679320">The California Supreme Court held that there was none, the statute says, “No person shall drive, move, relieve standing a motor vehicle upon on a highway unless it's registered and the appropriate fees have been paid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.649" offset="8725922">Under this code, the -- both the original complaint and the amended complaint filed in 1960 are in the record, the amended complaint appears have been right carefully drawn by the district attorney and it says this, I'll paraphrase the first sentence, Steven B. Galvin, Merced County District Attorney who being sworn complaints and accuses one information and belief, said the defendant of a misdemeanor to with failure to register motor vehicle and pay appropriate fees in violation of Section 4000 Vehicle Code of State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.403" offset="8893001">Now, it would be interesting and I would certainly think beneficial to have an examination of whether California could in fact collect that $100,000, that 2% from this officer who let's say already paid it once in Alabama and paid it again in Washington.</text>
