            <text syncTime="23.009" offset="195375">Mr. Chief Justice, and the Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.709" offset="210213">Today is on your desk a reproduction from the National Geographic Magazine just came out yesterday and is offered solely as a visual aid to the Court, the actual proof and the record is in the Department of Interior’s opinion, but it might be just helpful to the Court to locate the area where we are speaking about in this case, the area involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.749" offset="334346">If you look down in the right hand corner of the little plat, you will see the Mississippi River and its various mouths and the southwest pass is indicated on there and there's a little black dot saying Burrwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.266" offset="428387">Burrwood is where this 800 acres is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.247" offset="460361">I'd like now to return, if Your Honors please, to a matter of the Department of Interior's opinion because as this record shows, it lies at the very root of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.903" offset="510934">It was subsequently appealed to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.930" offset="531101">Now, the litigating part is of course including these parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.076" offset="555656">The District Court affirmed the opinion of the Department of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.146" offset="571956">It was appealed to the circuit and ultimately a petition for writ was requested of this Court and this Court denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.973" offset="611244">So, this record is based and this title, this oil and gas lease, it was executed by the Department of Interior in favor of Wallis was founded in the bottom upon the Department of Interior's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.980" offset="683342">So that in this litigation, the court below and perhaps this Court says, for the situation where this matter has run the gamut of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.454" offset="729213">The Department of Interior's opinion has been as I see it become final in is binding, binding on the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.092" offset="767770">Now, again, I would like to call Your Honors' attention to these facts that when the original application was filed on acquired land's lease the parties at that time thought that it had been acquired from a Louisiana land owner and they described it, very lengthily and filed an application for it in the name of Wallis.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.264" offset="872469">McKenna, who had an interest in it, conformed with the regulations of the department by filing his notice that he did have this interest in this particular lease as he was required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.990" offset="931297">Now, then after that it appeared that perhaps this was a “mud lump” filing which have been created and which was not in the State of Louisiana so there have been a filed for a public domain lease and used the same description, it's a very complicated elaborate description as can be seen from the Department of Interior's opinion that you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.475" offset="1029308">There it was presented to the Department of Interior problem is this acquired lands or is it the domain lands and to resolve that problem, he had to undertake an exhausted of study of all of the available data, surveys, and otherwise, of this year since 1812.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.434" offset="1117080">It had had to examine the problem of the creation of the State of Louisiana by an Act of Congress and to determine thereupon especially in the light of this Court's historic Pad Land's decision as to whether or not this marginal sea which is rather particular mud island had come from was within the State of Louisiana under the purview of the Act of Creation and very carefully they examined that and very carefully they detailed that in that opinion that you have before the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.458" offset="1245184">It came into the inevitable conclusion that this mud island was never within the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.622" offset="1281860">Now then, in addition to that, the Department of Interior very carefully examined all of the other Acts which might conceivably have given to the State of Louisiana this property, this whole plans Act of 1849 and 1850 and they concluded in this very exhaustive opinion that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.539" offset="1365556">Then they took up the matter of the Submerged Lands Act of May 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.708" offset="1386245">Now counsel opposite say, that we misconstrue the effect of the Submerged Lands Act of 1953 and that the Department was only instituted in what took place a part to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.724" offset="1446222">But the very clear statement under the Department of Interior is that it examines in precise detail all of the provisions of the Submerged Lands Act of May of 1953 and when it reaches a filed summation of it as it does on page 18, it says, that none of these lands passed by the Small Plans Act nor did it pass under the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.058" offset="1567640">And then when it reaches these conclusions, it comes to this point as it must of necessity cause and as it states on ,as the Department of Interior states on page 19, “since it was held at the United States had the paramount prior order and Louisiana did not have title to the marginal sea, then Louisiana must not have had a basis for legislative jurisdiction to dispose of this [Inaudible] their resources, even though the United States may not have acted or entered the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.349" offset="1728763">So they're holding as it must that this is a matter of exclusive federal jurisdiction and the State had no jurisdiction but to make it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.636" offset="1761886">If Louisiana did not have a necessary contacts to establish a sufficient basis for legislative jurisdiction, how could in a State real property law apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="427.912" offset="1815071">The legislation and judicial decrees of a State can only apply to places and things over which the State has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.784" offset="1842552">Now with that opinion, having gone through the -- through the gamut of the courts and certiorari denied by this Court that opinion before the circuit below that court inevitably said that, how can a statute of real property of the State of Louisiana be made applicable to property over which the sole jurisdiction and they use the word sole jurisdiction, over which sole jurisdiction was proposed in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.871" offset="1990823">So, they declined to apply that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.824" offset="2086640">Well, it cited this opinion, Your Honor, as the basis for is holding that this was within the sole jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.814" offset="2130631">It did not quite reach the point of saying that -- or deciding or discussing whether it was actually in the State of Louisiana or not in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.102" offset="2167829">Now, in the description throughout in this matter and I'm sure the surveyor didn't know how to describe it, but he references to Plaquemines Parish Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.939" offset="2211088">Now that comes about if I might add to Your Honor very quickly, it comes about by virtue of the fact that Plaquemines Parish is an expanding sort of situation as a mouth of the Mississippi river keeps moving Plaquemines Parish embraces all of that area, so that was a description.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.351" offset="2276812">Now, you'll find in various parts in one time or not that people will refer to it as being within Plaquemines Parish Louisiana by virtue of this description, but that was never a final discussion if I am permitted on this question direct and I'm sure the court did that on the basis that there was no reason necessarily to get into it because the Department of Interior's opinion --</text>

            <text syncTime="849.122" offset="3499865">There has never been a final adjudication by any court at any time whether this specific land is acquired land or public domain land.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.265" offset="3556394">The decision by virtue of which Wallis obtained the list did not go out on a point whether the land was acquired or public domain, but it went up on one point and one point alone which was that Wallis had a proper description in his final application as a -- and the description in the opposing application was improper and erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.408" offset="3688991">What happened was this?</text>
            <text syncTime="900.416" offset="3705083">For some months after the option agreement of March 3rd, 1955 was executed, Wallis diligently prosecuted those applied lands applications in the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.328" offset="3764642">Then towards the end of 1955, Wallis in some inapplicable manner found out that his descriptions were wrong and that perhaps this land would be regarded as public domain land rather than as acquired land.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.983" offset="3847293">So at that point, he worked diligently for himself and for himself alone and that's what the brief of our adversary says.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.915" offset="3891075">At that point, he took the position mentally that his obligations to Pan American were at an end and then he constructed two new leases, two new lease office, one on the public domain farm and one on the acquired land's farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.787" offset="3974562">Into those, he put the corrected description which the courts held later to be valid and which was valid only because he was able to use the knowledge that he had gotten through the prosecution of the applications in which Pan Am admittedly have an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.603" offset="4073827">He filed the public domain offer in his own land on March 8th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.884" offset="4110921">He did not file the acquired lands offer until March 27th, 1956.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.337" offset="4216769">Now, the day before filed that new application, he filed a protest against the pending Morgan application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.707" offset="4262222">So that by virtue of that maneuver, he was able to bring into focus contest between the Mor --pending Morgan application which he knew contained a defective description and his own new public domain application which he knew had a full proof description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.795" offset="4358562">As a result of that contest, the court held ultimately that Wallis was entitled to prevail him because his description was correct and Morgan's description was not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.639" offset="4425958">Now what we say is, the federal interest involved here above everything else is the protection of the purity, sanctity of all agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government wherever they are.</text>
