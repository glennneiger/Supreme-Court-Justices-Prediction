            <label>Mr. Richard F. Watt</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Justice Black, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.869" offset="262875">This matter is before the Court in a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which in March of 1965 affirmed the dismissal of a stockholder's derivative suit which had been filed in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.437" offset="341138">Very briefly stated, and I will come back in a moment to give more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.197" offset="368201">The ground for dismissal was that the plaintiff shareholder had filed a false verification required by Rule 23 (b) of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.369" offset="424835">Federal Rule 23 (b) specifies that in derivative suits, the complaint shall be verified and it also specifies certain matters which shall be set out in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.303" offset="484603">The petitioner's view that this raises an important issue under the Federal Rules and one that goes far beyond the outcome of this particular case because it poses directly the question as to whether a procedural Rule can be used to impose upon admittedly a poorly educated and ignorant stockholder, a very substantial obstacles to her bringing a derivative suit where alleging misconduct on the part of officers and directors of the corporation in which she own stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.059" offset="623574">The record is clear that the petitioner here is a foreign-born, ill-educated seamstress in her mid 60s.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.527" offset="661504">As a matter of fact, the record on the deposition below indicate that she had difficulty in spelling her son-in-law's name, his name is Irving Brilliant.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.995" offset="699329">The complaint here was filed in December of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.305" offset="716570">It consists of 11 counts, eight of which alleged violations under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities of Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.590" offset="753768">Very briefly, it charges that the officers and directors who are named as defendants, wrongfully and in violation of the Securities Act made used of the corporation for the purpose of purchasing shares of stock of the corporation and also, Hilton Credit Corporation and that included in the shares of stock which were purchased were very large amounts of shares from the officers and directors themselves with the result that approximately $12 million of Hilton Hotels Corporation funds that were used for this purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.781" offset="894516">Approximately $4,800,000, were used to purchase the shares of the officers and directors, and those funds were paid to those officers and directors for the purchase of their stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.137" offset="947911">The complaint is filed, was signed by three attorneys and it was verified by Mrs. Surowitz in accordance with the provisions of Rule 23 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="220.572" offset="985631">She verified as true and correct, certain facts, very largely the facts of her stock ownership and the other facts which would indicate that she has standing or status to sue as a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.575" offset="1033697">The balance that is the charges of wrongdoings were verified by her on information and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.542" offset="1069537">Before answer was filed, the defendant moved to take Mrs. Surowitz's deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.872" offset="1090853">Upon receipt of that notice, we appeared in Court and asked the District Court to postpone the taking of the deposition until the defendants had filed some pleadings or answers so that we would have a better idea as to what issues might be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.334" offset="1144665">The District Court declined to postpone the deposition, and therefore, the deposition was taken in February of 1964 prior to any pleading having been filed by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.642" offset="1193984">The deposition was concluded and on the same afternoon, at approximately 3:30, as counsel for the petitioner, we were served with notice that on the next morning, the defendants would appear before the district judge and present a written motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.441" offset="1257096">Now, the motion appears in the transcript of record at page 117.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.934" offset="1279143">In that motion, two grounds were asserted for dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.283" offset="1296488">One, that the pleading was a sham pleading; and secondly, that Mrs. Surowitz was not a proper party plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.849" offset="1326791">The following morning, when we appeared in Court, the defendants filed an affidavit which indicated that the records of the corporation showed that she had not become a stockholder of record until October of 1963 and this was presumably the basis for asserting that she was not a proper party plaintiff because she did not have the contemporaneous stock ownership required by Rule 23 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="331.831" offset="1430653">The district judge at that time initially was inclined to have the matter argued immediately but at our request, he gave us 15 days in which to file affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.056" offset="1475584">In response to the motion therefore, we filed two affidavits, the affidavit of Irving Brilliant, Mrs. Surowitz's son-in-law, and the affidavit of Walter Rockler, one of the attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.813" offset="1522604">The matter was argued later on March and the Court at the end argument announced the order would be one of dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.305" offset="1556564">Thereafter, at the Court's request, counsel for the defendants' prepared detailed and lengthy findings of fact and conclusions of law which were discussed in Court on March the 27th and the order of dismissal was actually entered on March 30, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.969" offset="1631274">In Mrs. Surowitz's deposition, she was able to testify that her son-in-law had purchased stock for her with her money and at one point, she indicated the stock was purchased in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.308" offset="1680593">That in late 1962 or early 1963, she received certain communications from Hilton Hotels Corporation turned them over to her son-in-law and in effect asked him what they were all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.146" offset="1755930">Now, later in March after a further discussion between Mrs. Surowitz and her son-in-law, he brought to her a letter of protest which is a document attached to the deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.664" offset="1814026">And in that letter of protest which she signed, stated that she opposed as improper the two stock purchase transactions which I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.093" offset="1851747">In the summer of 1963, the dividend on Hilton Hotels Corporation was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.823" offset="1874631">She again spoke to her son-in-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.068" offset="1883617">He advised her that he was looking into the matter and it was of the opinion that certain officers and directors had acted improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.692" offset="1910157">Subsequently, in December, the son-in-law brought the complaint to her which had been prepared by counsel in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.912" offset="1938996">He read and explained it to her, and following that, she signed the verification.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.499" offset="1965328">The deposition also indicates and we do not dispute this at all that so far as her ability to explain or answer the basis for the complaint in the sense of articulating the facts or the basis for certain allegations, she was unable to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.287" offset="2036485">She answered repeatedly that she did not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.023" offset="2047457">She could not say it on her own words.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.232" offset="2056338">She did not understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.951" offset="2063130">She didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.827" offset="2066683">She left it to her son-in-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.625" offset="2073893">She also stated, however, that she knew that her stock was not right and that she indicated that when the complaint was brought to her after these previous discussions that I've indicated following her son-in-law's explanation, she signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.809" offset="2146617">The affidavits of Mr. Brilliant and Mr. Rockler indicate, it seem to me beyond question that before this complaint was prepared and filed, a very substantial amount of investigatory in research work had been done both by Mr. Brilliant and by Mr. Rockler and his associates in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.440" offset="2221119">A great deal of effort was made to go to records, to track down transactions, to look at financial statements and so on, and those are set out in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.437" offset="2269080">Mr. Brilliant also states in his affidavit that when he presented the complaint to his mother-in-law, Mrs. Surowitz, he told her that it represented the result of work that he had done and that the attorney in Chicago had done, and that it was his opinion that it was soundly based.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.364" offset="2344835">I think it is important to note in this connection that Mr. Brilliant himself has legal training.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.363" offset="2364792">He has acted as an investment counselor for a number of years and it is quite clear from the record, that since 1957 in connection with the small investment she has made, Mrs. Surowitz has relied upon her son-in-law for his recommendations and for his judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.361" offset="2432815">Now, the Court of Appeals in affirming, held at the verification was false and it held that it was false because in her deposition, Mrs. Surowitz indicated that she lacked requisite knowledge and understanding to know what she was verified.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.030" offset="2507525">The actual words of the Court which I think are significant for purposes of the issue now here at the -- at record 237, the Court said, she lacked completely -- she completely lacked any knowledge of the basis of the complaint at the time when she signed the same and swore to the verity thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.724" offset="2586311">At the bottom of 235 and 36, the Court said that the verification requirement, that is Rule 23 (b), is designed to compel a plaintiff to begin such suit with sufficient knowledge of facts and information to show by his verification that there is a substantial basis to support the complaint which she made.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.082" offset="2675649">It is our view that this is not a proper interpretation of Rule 23 (b) and that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed, primarily for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.977" offset="2719326">Rule 23 (b) is a procedural Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.193" offset="2732178">We believe that should be liberally construed particularly in light of the important public policy considerations where it's in -- where -- which is in -- which are involved in causes of action arising under the Securities Act and the intent of Congress that stockholders would act in effect as ancillary enforcers of those Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.091" offset="2823711">Secondly, we believe that if one studies the history of Rule 23 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="685.106" offset="2843773">It is quite clear that its principle purpose was to prevent collusive resort to the federal courts and that it was not intended and no Court has held that it was intended to impose a kind of comprehension test upon a plaintiff stockholder before that stockholder would have a right as the instigator to bring a corporate cause of action to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.055" offset="2939591">Very briefly, let me indicate why in the context of the facts here, we believe the public policy considerations are significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.886" offset="2978879">It is no longer the case in this country that stocks are held only by a relatively limited class of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.547" offset="3009599">All the statistics indicate that stock ownership is becoming much more widespread.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.587" offset="3029765">Significantly enough, the largest single group of stockowners in the United States today are housewives and unemployed women.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.473" offset="3065292">Elderly women, in particular, hold substantial bodies and quantities of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.977" offset="3091310">The Securities Act, if one looks to the legislative history, were particularly designed to protect unknowledgeable, and gullible, and uninformed, and uneducated individuals who might invest in the stock market.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.728" offset="3146271">Consequently to Rule -- to construe Rule 23 (b), as a qualification upon the comprehension of a stockholder before that stockholder can bring a derivative suit is very likely to bar the very individual sought to be protected by the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.162" offset="3227982">Now, from coming to the courts at all with complaints based upon alleged wrongdoing by corporate officers and directors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.330" offset="4864711">We have argued in our brief that the principal purpose of Rule 23 (b) was to prevent collusive resort to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.534" offset="4913507">And if one reads Hawes versus Oakland which was decided in 1882, it is quite clear that the Court felt that many corporations not desiring for one reason or another to go into the state courts and not wishing to have their causes of action tried as ordinary actions at law would seek out a friendly stockholder, have that stockholder who have the requisite diversity of citizenship, initiate a proceeding in the federal court which by that circumstance would be a suit in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.294" offset="5048508">The doctrine goes back to an 1856 decision of this Court, Dodge versus Woolsey and in Dodge versus Woolsey, the concept of the derivative suit by a stockholder asserting a cause of action which the corporation would not assert was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.049" offset="5119561">But when one reads Dodge versus Woolsey, it is clear that the argument was made there that collusion existed and the Court decided that there was not evidence of collusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.971" offset="5163238">But the dissenting justices stated quite clearly in Dodge versus Woolsey that this practice would open up the federal courts two collusively sought jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.128" offset="5567927">It's obvious that if someone is a professional strike suiter or if an attorney is a specialist in what might be described the bringing of strike suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.164" offset="6032071">All that the lawyer had sought out a stockholder and in which the lawyer himself had virtually no information except a memorandum on which to base the facts which he set forth in the pleading and under those circumstances, it would held that the attorney had violated the Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.884" offset="6098944">Now, the Murchison case which we contend is extremely close to the situation here.Mr. Murchison, the plaintiff on deposition was asked questions endeavoring to ascertain what facts he had supporting certain allegation, questions which from the decision appeared within quite similar to questions posed to Mrs. Surowitz here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.075" offset="6191626">Obviously, a man with many investment experiences so he was able to answer it but what is significant is that he stated that this information was general that he relied upon his attorneys that he asked his attorneys whether they thought they could make a case out of this and they assured him that they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.790" offset="6274487">It was asserted there that the violation of Rule 11 was due to the fact that the attorneys had knowingly procured a false verification by their client, Mr. Murchison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.183" offset="6324120">As a matter of fact, when this motion was first presented in the District Court when it was asserted that this was a sham pleading that Mrs. Surowitz's was pleading with the sham pleading, it certainly appeared to us now that this was a Rule 11 charge because there is no other place than the Federal Rules where the term sham pleading appears except in Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.787" offset="6402487">It is now been turned about by the District Court and the Court of Appeals always though the thrust of the motion was it -- it was the motion to dismiss for a false verification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.856" offset="6902784">It was our position that an important issue was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.645" offset="6917935">We were not completely certain that any difect -- defect might be cured by somebody else's verifying to the reason that I have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.530" offset="6953462">And furthermore, the District Court was inclined to dismiss by charging the counsel had violated the Rule -- a local rule, Rule 39.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.217" offset="6992227">But we were therefore in a position in which an appeal from our standpoint was essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.248" offset="7012394">We felt that this issue mainly the use of Rule 23 (b) in the fashion that was used here was one that should be brought up and determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.963" offset="7047189">And that was the reason that we acted as we get through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.423" offset="7061086">Now, finally if I might very briefly call the Court's attention to one argument made which I would like to comment on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.262" offset="7108420">Namely, that Mr. Rockler's affidavit cannot be possibly suffice us a verification, because of the reservation at the end of it which appears at the record 143.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.976" offset="7159306">I think it is quite clear that that reservation is an order to safeguard the attorney client privilege and the work product of the attorney but Mr. Rockler clearly states, under oath, in that affidavit that in his view the case is soundly grounded and that the proof will establish the essential veracity of the facts alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.590" offset="7253765">If there is a defect in the verification, It would be our position that the Court is entitled to search the record to see if the defect is made up anywhere in the same as the Court may search the record to see at a possible defect and allegation of citizenship is made elsewhere -- made up elsewhere in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.434" offset="7329102">So that whether Mr. Rockler's ver -- affidavit was labeled a verification or not, it serves the essential purpose of assuring to the Court that there is a basis for the allegation.</text>
