            <text syncTime="54.080" offset="319718">This is a habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.799" offset="330585">The respondent brought a petition for writ of habeas corpus to United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.848" offset="358797">He contended that his confinement pursuant to his life sentence for murder of Flossie May Ward resulted in non-constitutional confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.113" offset="407803">The District Court after a study of the record of his trial in the state court dismissed the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.906" offset="443016">The respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.534" offset="457540">That court in a two to one decision reversed the decision of the District Court and remanded the petition for writ of habeas corpus for a hearing in the District Court on two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.225" offset="500276">First, whether the respondent was insane at the time of the crime and secondly, whether the trial judge had denied the respondent due process by his failure on its own motion to impanel insanity jury to determine the question of the respondent's sanity at the time of trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.696" offset="722108">The question for this jury -- for this Court to determine then whether the question of the sanity of the -- of a person or the accused at the time of the crime is cognizable in a federal habeas corpus taken from a state conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.852" offset="786787">And secondly, whether with respect to the question of sanity at the time of trial, this was waived by the respondent's failure to raise that issue in the trial court or if not whether the record on its face does not affirmatively show that he was not denied due process by the failure of the trial court on its own motion to impanel a sanity jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.013" offset="879470">Finally, there is the issue submitted by this Court for consideration whether if either or both of the hearing specified in the order of the Court of Appeals should be held -- that should be held in the state or in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.676" offset="946030">The record before the District Court in the determination of the -- of these issues was the transcript of the respondent's trial in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.778" offset="990438">That transcript shows that the respondent was tried by Daniel -- by Judge Daniel Gazelli of the Criminal Court of Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.177" offset="1020113">He waived trial by jury and submitted himself to a bench trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.855" offset="1042787">The state introduced evidence which showed that the victim, Flossie May Ward and the respondent, were living together in a common-law status.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.552" offset="1089599">The victim worked at Collins Barbeque House in the south side of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.866" offset="1106840">There, the respondent would frequently go for his meals and to pick her up when she was through working for the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.336" offset="1128678">She worked the shift from about 10 in the evening to about five in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.184" offset="1152084">On the night of the murder in question, February 28, 1959, the respondent entered the Collins Barbeque House.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.600" offset="1185729">On duty there besides the victim were another waitress, Natty Bates and a cook by the name of Jim Hatten.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.522" offset="1217494">The respondent jumped over the -- the victim saw the respondent and said, “Ted, Don't start anything tonight” or words to that effect, obviously showing there had been some battle going on between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.648" offset="1265977">Nevertheless, he jumped over the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.154" offset="1279979">The cook and the waitress saw a revolver in his hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.293" offset="1292518">It was pointed at the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.703" offset="1302235">They heard two shots.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.770" offset="1310490">The victim ran off the door -- jumped over the counter and run off the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.217" offset="1324283">The respondent jumped over the counter and run off the door after her.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.605" offset="1337762">Subsequently, her -- her body was found in the sidewalk in front of the restaurant dead, and cause of death was proven to be a gunshot wound in the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.048" offset="1375587">The next day, Robert Moore came to the department of Officer Starr.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.832" offset="1394709">Moore had an apartment in the same complex with Starr.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.607" offset="1405785">He told him that he has been informed by a telephone call that Robinson was wanted for murder and that he was presently in his apartment and would the officer please came up and arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.259" offset="1444446">Officer Starr called for additional help with two additional policemen and they went up to the Moore apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.789" offset="1466493">They rang the bell, talked for about two minutes with Mrs. Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.438" offset="1481122">She informed them that Robinson had just left.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.911" offset="1503065">They then realized that a man whom they had first seen when they got off the elevator standing in the corridor was Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.502" offset="1525426">They went over and asked him his name and he admitted that he was and he was arrested and taken into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.331" offset="1548727">About an hour and a half later, Officer Starr, accompanied with another policeman, went back to the Moore apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.639" offset="1569938">There they found in the closet a hat and a coat that matched completely with the hat and coat that Robinson was described had been wearing at the time of the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.969" offset="1603271">In the pocket was found a revolver which was subsequently proven to be the murder weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.727" offset="1626258">The respondent admitted that the hat and coat were his but denied the ownership of the revolver.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.913" offset="1670980">After the State proved its case in this manner, the defendant presented his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.065" offset="1699610">The defendant was represented by two appointed counsel, Mr. Warren Carey and Mr. McDermott of the Chicago bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.406" offset="1725001">Mr. Carey was an experienced criminal attorney and had taught criminal law prior to this time at the DePaul University.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.730" offset="1766275">The def -- the respondent's defense did not in anyway contest or refute the facts proven by the State but rather attempted to raise the defense of insanity at the time of the crime, the evidence introduced in this respect tended to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.500" offset="1841403">There was testimony by his mother that when he was seven or eight years old, a brick that was dropped from a third floor hit him on the head and that thereafter he was cross-eyed, complained of headaches, and acted a little peculiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.155" offset="1895946">Nobody testified however to any unusual incidents that occurred until he went into the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.761" offset="1918412">Once one time when he was home on furlough while he was in the army, both his mother and a friend of the family testified that he was having dinner with a girlfriend, his mother prepared dinner for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.167" offset="1968044">They were sitting in the front room talking after the dinner.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.460" offset="1977240">The mother -- he asked the mother for some money and the mother denied it to him and he kicked a hole in the bar in the front room.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.621" offset="2009840">He later went back into the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.428" offset="2017050">He was discharged to -- for all the record shows in normal course of the events.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.149" offset="2044008">After he was released from the army it appears he worked with his grandfather, Mr. Ed Langham as it is his profession as a painter.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.129" offset="2079848">Mr. Langham testified that on some occasions during this time, he would seem to be in the daze, walk off the job without saying anything to anybody, come back about two or three hours later in seemingly normal condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.478" offset="2129272">During this period, there was also a testimony that he seemed to have a glare in his eye and deep -- be in deep study.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.303" offset="2156544">In 1952, he went to the home of his aunt, Mrs. Calhoun and asked her -- told her that people were trying to kill him.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.200" offset="2196146">She called up his mother, his mother came.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.195" offset="2208162">He fought against letting his mother in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.830" offset="2218715">Then then he fought against his mother and his aunt looked at them and according to that testimony, he had a starey look in his eye and seemed to be a bit foamy in the mouth.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.807" offset="2366568">When they did, they took him into custody, took him to Hines Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.991" offset="2395303">He was later sent to County Hospital and finally committed to Kankakee State Hospital, a state mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.886" offset="2422888">Subsequently, he was released from that hospital about six months later as cured by the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.778" offset="2450474">There was a hospital report that is in the record that was issued at this time which describes all the typical symptoms of delirium tremens.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.686" offset="2494151">About – after he was released, he seemed to either difficult -- getting difficulty with his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.890" offset="2514944">There is a testimony in the record by Mr. Langham that in one occasion, the respondent got into a serious fight with his wife and took her clothes off in the backyard and purported to burn them.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.114" offset="2559875">In 1953, however, his wife left him.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.541" offset="2573563">This seemed to disturb him greatly.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.355" offset="2580773">He shot himself -- he shot his young child and then attempted to commit suicide first by shooting himself and then by jumping into a lagoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.358" offset="2612851">When neither of these attempts failed, he went to a policeman and surrendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.307" offset="2628629">He was tried and convicted and sentenced for the murder of his child.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.651" offset="5221961">In Leland versus Oregon, there was a murder conviction in which the individual tried to assert the defense of insanity at the time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.541" offset="5253517">His -- his defense was disallowed and his conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.485" offset="5281311">In this Court, he contended that he was denied due process by the rule that -- of Oregon that a person who attempts to raise the defense of insanity at the time of the crime is proven beyond reasonable doubt and by the rule of Oregon that applied as a test for the question of insanity at the time of the crime, the McNaughton test with no additional tests or factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.153" offset="5375979">This Court held that this was not a violation of due process of law that a state could apply any test -- properly -- proper test desired for the question of insanity at the time of the crime with respect to the burden of proof thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.344" offset="5428746">If this Court of Appeals was correct and the issue was cognizable and had a review of the state conviction, of course there would have to be a federal test that would be applied to determine whether the state properly ruled on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.994" offset="5479320">There would have to be some federal test that could be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.917" offset="5494993">The decision in Leland versus Oregon that there is no such federal test, I submit, is therefore inconsistent with the ruling of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit that the issue is cognizable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.298" offset="5744515">Furthermore, we contend that it's contrary to the decision of this Court in Bishop versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.685" offset="5766144">The Bishop case was a 2255 proceeding by a federal prisoner to which he alleged that he was insane at the time of the crime and he was insane at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.409" offset="5808985">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held one that insanity at the time of the crime was not reviewable in a 2255 proceeding and secondly, that there had been an adequate hearing in the trial court on his issue of his insanity at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.668" offset="5878053">This Court in a per curiam decision remanded the case for a hearing on the question of his insanity at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.012" offset="5907414">We contend Your Honors that by not reversing its decision on the question of insanity at the time of the crime that this was a sub silencio affirmance of the decision of the Seventh -- of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that this issue was not cognizable under 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.151" offset="5975960">Of course if it was not cognizable under 2255, it is not cognizable under 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.025" offset="6031444">We believe that this is the proper result also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.623" offset="6045863">Under the common law tradition, insanity at the time of the crime is a defense because -- to the charge of criminal responsibility because it negates the mens rea required for criminal responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.073" offset="6103646">Just like any other affirmative defense to the charge of crime, it is a defense because it negates one of the essential elements for a crime, in this case, the mens rea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.474" offset="6145233">While it may seem on its face that it is a violation of our concept to liberties to say that a person can be convicted for a crime that he committed while he was insane, it is equally contrary to our concept of board of liberties to say a person can be convicted for a crime of which he was innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.501" offset="6221406">Yet this Court -- the federal court does not review the ultimate question of guilt or innocence in a federal habeas corpus, this is a question for the jury to determine whether that all the elements of a crime had been made out whether any defense to one of these elements has been adequately proven by the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.194" offset="6288175">We contend that insanity at the -- at the time of the crime which is merely a defense to one of the elements of criminal responsibility should be treated no differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.361" offset="6328822">It is generally -- it is just merely one defense to a charge of crime to determine the nature of which by the trier of fact is conclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.261" offset="6840404">This Court said with respect to that barely, we do not have to consider the issue because it was adequately handled in the trial court under Brown versus Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.629" offset="6889932">Of course that could be interpreted to mean that the issue was cognizable in this -- but this Court didn't have to rule on it because Brown versus Al -- Allen at the -- the authority that was then applicable to the question of whether a trial court would -- habeas corpus will have to have a full plenary hearing just didn't require in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.164" offset="6972061">However, since the issue was not discussed by this Court, we think it more reasonable to interpret this decision as merely a holding that there was no need to determine whether it was cognizable at all or not since it had been fully -- fully canvassed in the state court in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.987" offset="7043323">We contend that that is the interpretation that is most likely especially in light of the decision of two Courts of Appeals which after Brown versus Allen have held the issue was not cognizable on habeas corpus and because of the decision of this Court in Bishop versus United States which came subsequent to the decision of Brown versus Allen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.452" offset="12873226">We contend that the respondent, Theodore Robinson was denied his federal constitutional right in his trial in the state court in Illinois on a charge of murder in several particular respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.340" offset="12940727">Specifically, he was denied his right to due process by the failure of the trial court to convene a jury to hold a hearing on the sanity of Mr. Robinson at the time of the trial or to afford him a fair hearing of any sort on that issue despite the fact that the evidence clearly suggests the issue of sanity at the time of trial or insanity at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.613" offset="13057860">Secondly, we believe that the undisputed evidence shows that Mr. Robinson was in fact insane at the time of the allegedly criminal act and that to convict a man for acts committed while insane violates due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.112" offset="13131839">We believe in addition to that that regardless of whether sanity at the time of the crime is necessarily a constitutionally protected defense that in Illinois, the law is clear that the court or that the state must prove sanity at the time of the crime, beyond a reasonable doubt as an essential element of its case wherever that issue is raised and that therefore the failure of the state to adduce any evidence on that issue and the conviction of the defendant in the absence of any evidence to support an essential of the crime violates due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.262" offset="13396407">Your Honor, the law in Illinois is very clear that the presumption of sanity as it is called is not an evidentiary presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.392" offset="13440920">In People versus Monroe, the Illinois Supreme Court and they have held this consistently and have always held, that there is no evidentiary value in the presumption of insanity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.572" offset="13709667">We believe that the Court of Appeals should have issued the writ of habeas corpus in this case and I might say at this time that the reason that we believe that we are entitled to raise that to this Court is because of the special question that was certified by this Court in which this Court asked whether or not any further proceedings should be held in the state court rather than in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.324" offset="13812694">Now I'll get to this later but I think it's very clear that the only way that it can ever be any further proceedings in the state court is if this Court decide -- or the Federal Court at some point decides that there were violations of constitutional rights and if the writ of habeas corpus should issue because this Court has no power -- the federal courts have no power on habeas corpus to remand the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3653.362" offset="14716844">I believe I was to the point of saying that we also believe there was a denial of due process of the fundamental right to a fair trial by the conduct of this trial as the court below stated in an atmosphere of haste by a failure to afford the defendant, Robinson, an adequate opportunity to obtain the testimony of important witnesses on all of the issues, issues of sanity at the time of crime and sanity at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.578" offset="14845680">And finally Your Honors, we believe that there was a clear denial of Robinson's Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process by the refusal of the trial court to issue a subpoena for a witness when Mr. Robinson specifically asked that the witness be subpoenaed by the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3755.116" offset="15123832">With respect to the psychiatrist, the counsel for the defense during the second day of this trial suddenly realized that they were going to get to the end of the case that day.</text>

            <text syncTime="3770.943" offset="15187153">The court had been pushing this trial as a race against time with an incredible number of situations where he chastised defense counsel for wasting a minute here or a minute there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.060" offset="15231561">And finally, this is all culminated in a situation where the defense counsel realized that this case was going to end, this capital case and really about a day and out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.643" offset="15277955">And he informed the Court that he had contacted this psychiatric witness and that he was unable to reach him that day, but as he said, I am sure we will be able to have him in here tomorrow morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.010" offset="15335424">And the Court said if -- at that point, the court said, if you subpoenaed him, I'll issue a capias but if you didn't, it's too bad, you've got to prepare your case before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.492" offset="15389341">If you didn't subpoena him, we will not delay the trial for him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3857.423" offset="15533014">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.933" offset="15547120">We had discussed the several, separate situations or examples in which we contend due process was violated by Robinson's trial in the state court on the charge of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.529" offset="15605530">When all of these separate issues are taken together and when the record in this case is examined as a whole, there is one picture I submit which emerges with particular clarity and beyond any question and that is taken as a whole, Mr. Robinson was clearly denied his fundamental right to procedural due process, his fundamental right to a fair trial by the conduct of his trial in the Criminal Court of Cook County, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.846" offset="15738755">And I think that picture is perhaps best expressed in the language of the Court of Appeals when it reversed the District Court's denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus without hearing and ordered the plenary hearing to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.873" offset="15802911">The Court of Appeals stated “Robinson's trial was conducted under an undo preoccupation with hurried disposition, in an atmosphere charged with haste hardly consistent with the gravity of a capital case and production of the right -- and protection of the right to due process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.099" offset="15883786">And then it went on, “Robinson was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in an unduly hurried trial without a fair opportunity to obtain necessary expert psychiatric testimony in his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.437" offset="15937076">Without sufficient development of facts on the issue of insanity at the time of the homicide and at the time of the trial and upon a record which does not show that the state court after a full hearing reliably found the relevant facts” and that I submit is a very clear and correct picture of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.197" offset="16024116">We believe that the Court of Appeals was clearly correct and finding that when the District Court failed to require the state to even file a return to this petition, failed to appoint counsel and failed to hold plenary hearings that in light of the failure of the record to show that the state court had held a full hearing and reliably found the facts that a plenary hearing was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.720" offset="16122232">We believe also, however, that the record on its face clearly shows that there was a denial of due process in this trial and we think that the Court of Appeals findings actually support that and that what should have been done was that a writ of habeas corpus should have issued conditioned upon permitting the state sufficient time to afford Robinson a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.315" offset="16220662">Now the state on the other hand of course contends that the District Court's denial of the petition should be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.837" offset="16274683">They contend that there is no evidence that would have required a sanity hearing pursuant to the state law and that in any event the right to a sanity hearing was waived and they further contend that the claim of insanity at the time of crime is -- does not raise federal constitutional issues and is not cognizable in habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.122" offset="16363813">As we see it, the state has not even turned its attention at all either in the briefs or in the argument here to the failure to afford the defendant fundamental due process by failing to afford him a fair trial by denying an adequate opportunity to obtain witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.170" offset="16448031">In many respects then this case is a fact --</text>

            <text syncTime="4092.669" offset="16474049">So far as the facts of this case go, how do you deal with the language in the record Mr. Dermott's statement in the record, page 167 which was referred to by Mr. Michael that he had got in touch with many psychiatrists or at least made two or three dozen telephone calls to psychiatrists and then he decided not to subpoena any of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4121.296" offset="16588570">Well, I think Your Honor that all that Mr. McDermott is saying at this point is during the trial he had told the court that he had an expert witness that he wanted to call the next day and Your Honor will recall, the court said well if you subpoenaed him, alright, but if you didn't, we're not going to continue this case for two hours, you've got to prepare your case in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.100" offset="16687731">I think McDermott is simply here explaining the fact that he had not subpoenaed the psychiatrist because he didn't believe in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.912" offset="16718973">He was never given an opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.228" offset="16724302">This certainly does not in any way dispute the statement he made during the trial that he had an expert witness that would be available the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.529" offset="16765471">I'd also like to point out one other thing and this is perhaps in a delicate area Mr. Justice Stewart, but at this stage of the proceeding, the portion of the record that you are reading occurred after the defendant had been found guilty, sentenced to life imprisonment, ordered taken out of the courtroom, the court case -- the next case was called, really an amazing procedure here at the end in which the court just clearly have held no hearing on aggravation or mitigation, it wanted to get this guy out of the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.481" offset="16897337">The defendant, Robinson, at this point had said to the court, Your Honor, I think my counsel must have been incompetent if they didn't subpoena witness and you say that you won't let me have these witnesses unless they're subpoenaed and I think my counsel must have been incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.640" offset="16949896">He was then taken out of the court room and these statements by his counsel were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.014" offset="16963480">Now I don't really think that they're entitled in any weight at all under these circumstances but in any event, they certainly do not in any way take away from his counsel statement during the trial that he wanted to call an expert witness and would have him available the next morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="4238.399" offset="17056998">He says that there is a claim in here by the counsel at this point with respect to the -- with respect to the Moores.</text>

            <text syncTime="4252.581" offset="17113736">The defendant Mr. Robinson had specifically asked the court to subpoena two witnesses who were -- who -- in whose home he had stayed after the crime and he would have the best opportunity perhaps of anyone to observe his behavior at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.283" offset="17180505">The court said, what will they testify to?</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.046" offset="17191581">And the defendant said, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.933" offset="17199104">And the court said, well unless you can tell us what he is going -- they're going to testify to, I won't issue a subpoena for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.366" offset="17220838">Now it appeared in the record that there was a dispute between defendant and his counsel with respect to calling the Moores and the defendant's counsel didn't want to call them and the defendant said, I want a subpoena issued for the Moores and at the conclusion of the trial, he made that statement again to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.946" offset="17283114">And, once again, as Your Honor points out then after he was taken out of the courtroom, his counsel made a self-serving statement about that why he hadn't subpoenaed the Moores.</text>

            <text syncTime="4330.705" offset="17426160">The Supreme Court of Illinois specifically holds that due process prohibits the trial of a man who is insane and that the failure to give him a hearing on his sanity when that issue is raised is a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.314" offset="17512678">Now in People versus Burson, 11 Illinois 2d 360, that -- that question was specifically treated by the Court and they said, the trial adjudication sentence or execution of a person charged with a criminal offense while insane is a violation of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.612" offset="17589791">And it becomes the duty if that issue is raised of the court to conduct the hearing before a jury upon the issue and the denial thereof as a violation of due process and I think that's clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.077" offset="17635662">And as Mr. Michael has conceded certainly, there is only one way in which a sanity hearing is heard -- is held in Illinois and that is by the convening of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.206" offset="17672234">The Court does not conduct the hearing on sanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.291" offset="17688534">The fact of this case is that there was no hearing on this man's sanity at the time of trial and the Illinois Supreme Court admits that and the law is very clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.579" offset="17729703">I think there has been some confusion with respect to the law on how this issue is raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="4645.162" offset="18684008">But I think that the law is clear and to answer your question directly, I think that necessarily the Court by its remand in Bishop was indicating that it would violate due process to try a man while he was insane and as I say, the Supreme Court of Illinois certainly has no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.390" offset="18756942">They say in so many words, the trial adjudication sentence or execution of a person charged with a criminal offense while insane is a violation of due process of law and I think that clearly is the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.826" offset="18810650">Now the petitioner then is – the State Illinois is left with the proposition first of all that there was no evidence in this record that would require the canvassing of the question of whether or not Mr. Robinson was insane at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.833" offset="18902706">That this question in effect was not raised by the evidence because as I have indicated under Illinois law if it is raised by the evidence, the Court has the duty itself to convene this sanity hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.077" offset="18955682">In fact, however, and I think it's very clear from the record that there was substantial evidence of insanity at the time of the trial and that the failure to conduct the sanity hearing in the face of this evidence deprived Robinson of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.840" offset="19010748">The -- and again, before mentioning this evidence, I want to particularly emphasis the fact that here, there was no hearing at all because the judge cannot conduct this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.477" offset="19053275">It's strictly, it's something that he has to convene a jury for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.916" offset="19067068">Now Mr. Michael has outlined the evidence in -- in brief with respect to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.163" offset="19096012">There were four live witnesses, all of who testified that they believe in their opinion that Mr. Robinson was insane at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.745" offset="19130389">That in itself in my opinion raises the issue and triggers the responsibility of the state court to determine the issue, but this was not just the opinion of these witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.960" offset="19171244">This was backed up by a long set of facts with respect to Mr. Robinson's past history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.628" offset="19205935">You've heard about the -- the situation when he was struck in the head with a brick when he was a -- a young boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.377" offset="19236864">You heard about the situation in which he destroyed furniture in his mother's home without any apparent cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.620" offset="19265808">The glaring moods that he was observed to be in, apparent lack of ability to communicate with the people around him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.349" offset="19300812">The fact that during his employment after he was released from the army, he often walked off his -- his job in apparent daze for no reason and you have heard to some extent about this incident that caused his commitment to by court order incidentally to the Kankakee State Hospital, an Illinois mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.422" offset="19393076">This was a situation in which the defendant Robinson had a complete mental breakdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.289" offset="19420557">He believed people were trying to kill him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.021" offset="19427453">He believed people were trying to kill his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.588" offset="19437693">A policeman that was called entered the room and said he's lost his mind entirely, we'll have to take him to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.367" offset="19468831">He tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the ambulance on the way to the hospital and eventually he was committed to the Kankakee State Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.613" offset="19505821">Now it's true as Mr. Michael points out that the record of the Kankakee State Hospital which was introduced in the evidence by the defendant shows that he had been drinking and that there was some alcoholic influence here, but it also shows that the psychiatrist who examined him had a serious question as to whether or not he was paranoid schizophrenic, or I believe schizophrenic was the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.444" offset="19589099">The record shows, I wonder if he isn't schizophrenic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.068" offset="19607594">Now after he was released from the hospital and from that point on, the Illinois Supreme Court says -- said, there was no evidence that his illness was of an enduring or continuing nature, but here's what happened after that that was in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.950" offset="19671124">His mother testified that she -- that he was released from the hospital to the custody of his wife who was in effect starving and went in and begged and -- that he'd be released and that's why they finally decided to release him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.739" offset="19718353">His mother thought he was still insane then.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.059" offset="19731623">He at one point took out his wife's clothes out of their home and tried to burn them in the backyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.171" offset="19756074">In 1953 I believe it was as the state has told you, he murdered his 18-month-old baby boy by shooting him in the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.782" offset="19790451">He had -- his wife had left him, he had no place to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.284" offset="19800482">He went to his aunt's house and asked if he could stay overnight and when his aunt came back the next day from work, Robinson's 18-month-old baby boy had been slain in the living room of this apartment and Robinson then attempted to commit suicide in two different ways and eventually gave himself up to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.992" offset="19883342">When he was brought into the hospital, he was observed to be in one of these trance like daze moods that had been testified about previously in his history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.713" offset="19934229">Mr. Michael refers to the fact that he was convicted of murder for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.175" offset="19960038">That is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.064" offset="19967666">The record is very unclear, but it is clear that he served four years whether in a penitentiary or in a mental hospital is not clear but the -- the penalty for a murder in Illinois is 14 years and you can't get out for four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.458" offset="20025240">So it's very apparent that this was on some sort of a reduced sentence and I'm completely off the record, but I guess from my knowledge of Illinois procedure is that in view of the obvious insanity defense, some sort of a deal was worked out where he would get a man slaughter charge or something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.945" offset="20103189">After he was released from wherever he was, but it was, I'm not suggesting that he was committed, I think it was a penal institution although perhaps he's criminally insane, after he was released from there, the evidence continues with respect to further showings of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.737" offset="20190333">A number of people, four lay witnesses all continued that -- he continued to have these moods in which he appeared to be days, uncommunicated, depressed and these moods were very often accompanied by unexpected flare of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.437" offset="20273089">A warrant was sought by his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.653" offset="20281971">Now Mr. Michael says, a warrant was sought because he had been fighting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.643" offset="20297958">Well there was some mentioned at the back that he had been fighting but the precise testimony that his mother gave on that subject was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.250" offset="20344351">I went to 48 Street Station and took out a warrant and I told them that I wanted -- what I wanted with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.150" offset="20367966">I told him that my son seemed to have a disturbed mind with things he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.991" offset="20387297">He is not normal and I wish you would help me to pick him up so I can have him put away.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.089" offset="20415718">Now that's what his mother wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.472" offset="20421256">His mother had -- attempting to have him again committed and this warrant was taken out with the first one about a year before the homicide in this case and she tried again, and the record is a little unclear but within a month or two to have him picked up and he -- unfortunately, the warrant was never served.</text>
            <text syncTime="5094.902" offset="20483009">He was to be picked up for recommitment to a mental institute.</text>

            <text syncTime="5117.570" offset="20573602">Now, in addition to that, at the time of the homicide here, the evidence adduced by the state showed an amazing similarity to the testimony of the defendant's witnesses with respect to Robinson's conduct and this again is something that is not previously been mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.954" offset="20679137">When Mr. Robinson walked into this restaurant where the shooting occurred, the testimony reveals that he walked up to the counter in the front of the restaurant about four feet away from the victim with a gun in his hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.219" offset="20748204">And he stood and he stared for -- the testimony was -- about -- if I'm not mistaken, about two minutes, he stood and he stared without saying a word at this woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.582" offset="20793657">He then turned away and walked 20 feet back to the back of the restaurant, jumped over the counter placing two people between himself and the defendant and then ran around through the front behind this counter and the defendant there, the deceased then jumped over the counter and Robinson -- shots were heard and the deceased was found outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.465" offset="20889266">This conduct during -- throughout incidentally this whole time, Robinson did not say a single word.</text>

            <text syncTime="5425.371" offset="21804805">He had not -- he wouldn't have to go back by the officers to get to the elevator and the record is very clear on this and brought out for cross-examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="5445.782" offset="21886516">They asked him his name, he told them his name.</text>

            <text syncTime="5492.925" offset="22075120">Now we talked about the way in which this trial was conducted and that's another factor, both on the issue of sanity at the time of trial and sanity at the time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.621" offset="22129873">The Court of Appeals referred with great particularity to the number of occasions in which the trial judge has chastised the defense lawyers to hurry along on their presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.389" offset="22188910">This capital case lasted from 11 o'clock one morning until about 2:30 in the afternoon the next day and yet, despite its -- the shortness of it, there were these constant attempts to hurry the proceeding, in a real atmosphere of haste and I think it's perhaps best revealed by the proceedings at the very end in which the trial judge, as soon as the defense lawyer finished his summation without even asking if there was any rebuttal, the trial judge said, bring him to the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.132" offset="22323911">I find you guilty of murder, I sentenced you to life imprisonment, take him away, call the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.896" offset="22347003">That's literally the way the transcript on that reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.868" offset="22358810">And the defense -- the defendant himself said, Your Honor may I say something and he then addressed the court about -- he didn't think his counsel were competent and so forth and the court interrupted him and said, still and all, I think you're guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5574.716" offset="22402278">Take him away and call the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.797" offset="22414608">That -- that's the atmosphere of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.717" offset="22422235">Now it was for that reason and I think very clearly when you read the record, it was for that reason that when Mr. Robinson asked to have the Moores subpoenaed that the court would not issue a subpoena for the Moores.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.748" offset="22474376">It wasn't that Robin -- the court knew better than -- that Robinson had to tell him what the Moore is going to testify to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.315" offset="22496632">He didn't want to interrupt the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.883" offset="22506872">It also occurred again and had another effect with respect to Dr. Haines and I think this is a very significant thing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.913" offset="22543026">The state's attorney himself -- the state attorney had put in the stipulated evidence of Dr. Haines that Robinson was competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.706" offset="22578239">Let's see.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.178" offset="22580120">Robinson understood the nature of the charges and could cooperate with counsel but recognizing that this was not a complete answer to all of the evidence of insanity at the time of trial and no answer at all on insanity at the time of crime, the state's attorney said, Your Honor, Dr. Haines is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.000" offset="22663398">I -- not available now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5641.823" offset="22670712">I proceeded on the assumption after having talked to Mr. Carey that Dr. Haines' testimony to both matters would go in by stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.208" offset="22704253">Now the defense raised here is such that I think we should have Dr. Haines' testimony, as to his opinion whether this man is sane -- is now sane.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.713" offset="22742183">It is possible that the man might be insane and know the nature of the charge or be able to cooperate with his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.933" offset="22767156">I think it should be in evidence Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.134" offset="22775933">In other words, he wanted to call Dr. Haines as a live witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.984" offset="22787323">But the court said, no, I don't think you need Dr. Haines and that's the -- that's the last bit of colloquy in the record, right after that, the arguments began.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.714" offset="22830268">So that this case ended without any expert psychiatric testimony despite the fact that both the defense counsel and the state's attorney wanted to have psychiatric testimony in this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="5875.257" offset="23604433">Now I want very much to get to the procedural issue that Your Honor specifically certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.045" offset="23635571">But before doing so, I must say a few words about sanity at the time of the crime because the evidence that we talked about here was conclusive in my opinion on the question of sanity at the time of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5895.115" offset="23683845">At the very least, it certainly raised a very serious question of sanity at the time of crime and yet the state admittedly did not put on one word of evidence on that issue and we believe that the combination of those factors plus the denial of the -- by the -- by the court of the right to put on further expert evidence on insanity at the time of the crime clearly denied the defendant of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.402" offset="23792933">And we think that sanity at the time of the crime is obviously cognizable in habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="5928.028" offset="23815502">I think this Court must hold that it would be a violation of due process to convict the man for acts committed while he is insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="5937.606" offset="23853746">I do not contend that this Court has specifically so held but certainly, the statement by Justice Frankfurter in his dissent in the Baldi case is a statement that the majority apparently would have adhered to in that case in a statement which I think this Court would adhere to and Mr. Justice Frankfurter said, ever since our ancestral common law emerged of the darkness of its early barbaric days, it has been a password of western civilization that the taking of life by the hand of an insane person is not murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.527" offset="23997524">I think that is clearly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.376" offset="24004838">I think that as the state has conceded, it would not be possible for the states to deprive or to deny the defense of insanity two state courts -- Supreme Courts have so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="5988.701" offset="24058128">And if insanity at the time of the crime is constitutionally protected defense, if you may not convict the man for X committed while he was insane then that question, the assertion that he was insane at the time of the crime raises federal constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.619" offset="24129808">It states facts which are true would entitle the petitioner to relieve and clearly under Townsend versus Sain and Fay versus Noia, this Court necessarily must inquire whereof that defense was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.331" offset="24184665">And on the record in this case, it is very clear that the defense was rejected without inadequate hearing, that the record does not fairly support the state court's finding, that there in fact was not, after a full and fair hearing, a reliable finding of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.960" offset="24255195">This Court has never distinguished between collateral issues and issues which it decided for defendant might be determinative and permitting -- and in canvassing constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.700" offset="24314128">Surely, this Court if there has been a violation of his federal constitutional right by the manner in which the issue of insanity at the time of crime was -- this Court is not going to ignore that or refuse to hold a plenary hearing simply because if in fact he were found to be insane, he would then have to be released rather than given a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6075.777" offset="24406497">I think that the Court of Appeals was absolutely correct in holding as it did on this record that a plenary hearing on the issue of insanity at the time of the crime was mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.882" offset="24454875">I also believe, however, that on the face of the record, there was a denial of procedural due process with respect to the way in which this issue was handled which in it of itself would require the Court to issue a writ without holding the plenary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.748" offset="24514330">And therefore, we get to the question of what the further or where the further hearing should be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.611" offset="24549857">Now if there is to be a plenary hearing on either of the issue of sanity at the time of crime or sanity at the time of trial, a plenary hearing on those issues must be held in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.141" offset="24595937">This Court has no power to remand the case to the state court on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.094" offset="24611715">Its only power is to determine whether or not the constitutional rights of the defendant have been violated and if it finds that they have been violated, it must issue the writ.</text>

            <text syncTime="6498.107" offset="26095783">Let's assume we agree with you that there has been a denial of constitutional rights in that there was not a fair hearing, a fair enough hearing on the insanity at the time of the crime and that there was a denial of constitutional right but there was no hearing at all to speak of competency to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6518.710" offset="26178226">And if those two matters should be determined on their merits, you say that unless they have a complete new trial that -- that determination on its merits should take place in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="6535.688" offset="26246144">Because Mr. Justice White, in Rogers versus Richmond, this Court pointed out that if there has been a what I have called in my brief the denial of procedural due process, if the procedure is used in the trial court were not adequate to afford a fair trial to the defendant then he is entitled to having been denied due process in his trial, he is entitled to a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.694" offset="26370173">Now in Jackson versus Denno where the issue was simply whether or not it was to be determined according to this Court's formulation by the trial judge himself and it was the narrow issue of the voluntariness of the confession, the Court found no objection in view of the exigencies of federalism, found no objection to giving him a limited hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6591.597" offset="26469752">I have serious questions whether that was alright even in Jackson, but in this case, if you're trying to give Mr. Robinson a limited hearing in the state court on the question of his sanity at the time of the crime, you are then giving him a hearing which is totally unknown to Illinois law, on an issue which is always tried with the case on its merits, an issue in which the ability for example to cross-examine the state's current witnesses maybe very important and yet if it is a limited trial, there won't be any concurrent witnesses there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.074" offset="26615620">An issue incidentally in which the state court in a full trial, the jury in a full trial might very well find something less than legal insanity at the time of the crime but something sufficient to reduce the events under Illinois law to voluntary man slaughter.</text>
