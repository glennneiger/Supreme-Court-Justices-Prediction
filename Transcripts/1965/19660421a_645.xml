            <label>Mr. Robert S. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="44.679" offset="282102">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.314" offset="296626">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.843" offset="318777">It brings once again to this Court an aspect of the recurring problem of the relationship of the federal tax lien to conflicting state created liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.077" offset="375724">The question here arises from the application of a state court rule, which you may find in page 19 of our brief, which provides that in mortgage foreclosure actions, an allowance for an attorney's fee determined as a stated percentage of all sums adjudged to be paid the plaintiff, mortgagee, shall be included in the tax costs of the action and paid to the mortgagee out of the proceeds of the foreclosure sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.716" offset="502262">The question presented is whether the court below was correct as a matter of federal law in holding that the mortgagee is entitled to recover, not only his principle in interest, but also the attorney's fee ahead of a federal tax lien which had attached after the mortgage but subsequent to the default which led to the foreclosure -- but before the default which led to the foreclosure, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.934" offset="631097">The facts from which the controversy arise are not complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.594" offset="645726">In December 1960, respondent Equitable Life Assurance Society loaned one Albert Bagin and his wife $30,000 to be repaid at 6% interest over a period of 28 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.685" offset="706121">To secure repayment, Equitable received a mortgage covering real estate owned by the Bagins.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.094" offset="727751">The mortgage was properly record in the next few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.045" offset="743528">Second and third mortgagees were subsequently conveyed to other mortgagees but are not directly involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.011" offset="775398">More than a year later, in March 1962, the United States filed notice of the federal tax lien against Bagin.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.227" offset="812283">The lien secured a liability for $7700 in unpaid taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.050" offset="843525">The lien arose under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code upon the assessment of the tax liability under Section 6321, which is at page 17 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.428" offset="893053">It was a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property belonging to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.110" offset="923773">And under Section 6323, the lien was not valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser or judgment creditor until notice was prompt -- properly filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.305" offset="976541">Such notice was filed on March 21, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.689" offset="1010082">A year later, on March 1, 1963 the Bagins for the first time defaulted on their monthly payments to Equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.293" offset="1052505">After that default, it continued for more than 30 days, Equitable exercised its rights under the mortgage to declare the principal sum and unpaid interest immediately due.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.750" offset="1102346">And on June 4, 1963 Equitable filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Bergen County seeking foreclosure of the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.696" offset="1142157">The United States was named as a defendant in that action and summoned to answer the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.254" offset="1164413">In its answer, the United States conceded that the principle and interest on Equitable's mortgage was prior to the federal lien, but denied that the federal lien was subordinate to any claim Equitable might acquire to counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.125" offset="1231914">On motion for summary judgment, the Superior Court held that the federal tax lien was junior to the claim for principal and interest under the mortgage but senior to Equitable's claim for counsel fees and that any counsel fee awarded should be allowed in a surplus money proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.435" offset="1301086">The court thought that this conclusion was required by this Court's decision recently in United States v.Pioneer American Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.666" offset="1346017">Equitable appealed the appellate division and while the case was pending there the appeal was certified to the New Jersey Supreme Court on that court's own motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.287" offset="1380498">The Supreme Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.045" offset="1387604">It held that the Equit -- that Equitable was entitled to priority over the federal lien not only for its principal and interest and costs but also for its counsel fee under the rules of the New Jersey courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.409" offset="1440998">That fee had in the meantime been determined to be 425 odd dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.160" offset="1468061">Because the total claims exceeded the net proceeds of the foreclosure sale, the practical immediate consequence of the decision was to reduce the Government's recovery on its $7700 tax lien from $491 to $66.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.691" offset="1550085">This Court has long recognized that the uniform application of the federal tax law and the protection of federal revenues requires that state determinations of the relative priority of federal tax liens must meet federal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.931" offset="1623124">It implies no disrespect to the states to recognize as this Court has that in the absence of federal standards, the inevitable and natural tendency of the states would be to give precedence to state created liens running in favor of local real estate taxes, various municipal assessments as was the case in New Britain and Buffalo Savings Bank, or local commercial interests, all of which hit closer to home.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.524" offset="1749452">Accordingly to avoid the unequal application of the federal tax laws and to protect federal revenues from being whittled away, the court has evolved the general rule that whatever may be the priorities among state created liens, a recorded federal tax lien is subordinate to all previously perfected liens and superior to all subsequent and inchoate liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.800" offset="1866585">A corollary of that rule is that subsequently perfected liens do not relate back to the time of their creation to defeat federal liens perfected in the interval.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.182" offset="1920084">This doctrine represents an elaboration of a principle dating back to Chief Justice Marshall that first in time, is first in right.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.269" offset="1964492">Now the Court had occasioned to apply this general principle to facts quite similar to those presented here in the Pioneer American Insurance Company case three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.029" offset="2015483">Pioneer involved a mortgage that provided in terms that a reasonable attorney's fee shall be added to the principle sum and shall be secured by the instrument in the event of foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.919" offset="2075042">The Court held that where federal tax liens were accorded after the mortgage, after default, after the commencement of the foreclosure proceedings but before the entry of judgment fixing the amount of the attorney's fees such tax liens were entitled to priority over the lien for counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.599" offset="2165739">The Court likened the mortgagee's lien for counsel fees to a lien to secure future indebtedness, which had been held inchoate in United States v. Ball Construction Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.050" offset="2219551">The Court concluded that likewise when a mortgagee has a lien for an attorney's fee which is uncertain in amount and yet to be incurred and paid, such a lien is inchoate and is subordinate to the intervening federal tax lien filed before the mortgagee's lien for the attorney's fee matures.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.912" offset="2315055">Now, it is unquestionably true that there are points of difference between the present case and Pioneer.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.281" offset="2344521">Several of them, I think, show that this is a much stronger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.230" offset="2364270">Nevertheless as the court below stressed, the precise percentages set forth in the New Jersey rule given apparent definiteness to Equitable's claim for counsel fees which was not supplied by the relatively and definite provision for a reasonable attorney's fee --</text>

            <text syncTime="639.295" offset="2660603">The Sheriff who conducts the sale gets a percentage of the proceeds, but we're talking here about the net proceeds of the sale rather than the gross proceeds.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.798" offset="2714520">And what is the distinction between the tax cost which the Government concedes as priority and this tax cost from the way of -- a fixed percentage for counsel fees?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Rifkind</label>
            <text syncTime="668.461" offset="2777213">Well, there is -- there's first of all the historical difference that we have always recognized or generally recognized in the United States, in this Court, throughout the states that there is a difference between counsel fees as cost which may or may not be allowable, generally are not, and the fees paid into court to clerks and so on for services provided by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.541" offset="2873553">And that distinction is not foreign to the New Jersey courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.007" offset="2895391">Only shortly before this case was decided, the Supreme Court wrote in United States-Pipe &amp; Foundry -- the Supreme Court of New Jersey wrote in United States-Pipe &amp; Foundry, which is cited on page 14 of our brief that cost generally comprise principally certain statutory allowances, amounts paid the clerk in fees and various other specified disbursements of counsel, including sheriff's fees, witness fees, deposition expenses and printing costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.995" offset="3015346">Counsel fees, although if allowable, are included in the tax costs are an entirely different matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1521.368" offset="6188805">There was no doubt in Pioneer that the attorney's fee was to be incurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1570.344" offset="6384724">The fact is that Equitable's lien, if there was a lien at all, was entirely contingent because the events which would lead to the liability which the lien would secure had not occurred and might never have occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.956" offset="6507186">I would like to address first to the statements which Mr. Rifkind made concerning the ability of the Government to say that we should not be entitled to any cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.238" offset="6560371">To his statement in answer to Chief -- Justice White's question about the $150 counsel fee and his statement that if there was a lien at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.231" offset="6612302">These answers, I believe that he has presented, indicate a misconception of the -- what a mortgagee's lien is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.003" offset="6659427">It is a different lien from the lien of the Government at the time that the Government's tax lien arises, there has been a demand for payment of taxes and a refusal of payment then the assessment is made, the Government's tax lien arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.272" offset="6728495">The taxpayer has default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.040" offset="6735496">He's in default at the time the lien arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.978" offset="6747303">A mortgagee's lien arises at the time that the mortgagor and the mortgagee enter into a contractual relationship whereby the mortgagor agrees to repay alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.137" offset="6803937">We don't know at any time when or if the mortgagor will default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.131" offset="6831940">If he defaults, our courts or our legislatures or both, have said that the only recourse we have to realize anything out of our mortgage lien is to foreclose the mortgage in a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.630" offset="6897873">The only way we get anything, principal, interest, costs, advancement, anything we want, the only way we get it is to commence the foreclosure action after default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.581" offset="6945729">Carry that foreclosure action through to a share of sale and have the actual purchase price paid to the sheriff, our lien is then extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.855" offset="6982823">That's when we get paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.424" offset="6997034">That's when our lien becomes meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.310" offset="7004662">If our lien is taken away from us prior to that time we have known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.261" offset="7032456">I believe that the real question in this case concerns the 1913 Act of Congress which stated that a federal tax lien shall not be valid as to any mortgagee until notice is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.500" offset="7105390">In the light of the Pioneer case, I believe that that statute should now be read that a federal tax lien shall not be valid as to all choate rights of mortgagees until notice is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.753" offset="7174353">And the question that is presented to us today is how we are to determine the choate rights of a mortgagee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.939" offset="7223150">Commencing in 1950, this Court has decided almost a dozen cases involving competition or the choateness of state created liens on real property of taxpayers who are not insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.312" offset="7304652">In all of these cases except Pioneer, the liens were for municipal taxes, attachment liens or mechanics liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.047" offset="7351568">In all of these cases -- although some of these cases other than Pioneer started these mortgage foreclosure actions, the liens which this Court considered were not held by the foreclosing mortgagee, and that each of these cases other than Pioneer, the United States disputed the entire lien with the competing lien holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.248" offset="7444355">In Pioneer however, and in this case, the competing lien was and is held by the foreclosing mortgagee and his mortgage had been recorded long prior to the Government's federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.810" offset="7518647">In either of these cases however, has the Government chosen to dispute our entire lien, is probably because if it had chosen to do so it would have had to justify its position in the light of this 1913 Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.711" offset="7578206">And that Act did not apply to these other cases in which the United States had disputed the entire lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.811" offset="7618644">In order to avoid this position, this unfavorable position, we believe that the Government made the lists of all rights of mortgagees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.662" offset="7658036">And some of Your Honors have discussed some of these items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.985" offset="7679352">I would like to mention a few of them very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.226" offset="7692309">Although the Government concedes that principal is choate, it is not difficult to describe a mortgage in which the principal would not be choate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.841" offset="7738702">There would be no objective standard by which to measure the amount it would be due to the mortgagee that the mortgagor should default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.993" offset="7775378">In such a case, the principal of the mortgage would be every bit as inchoate until judgment is entered as the counsel fee is in -- was in Pioneer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.175" offset="7824071">The interest is even more inchoate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.190" offset="7836087">Interest and counsel fee in New Jersey are computed in exactly the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.818" offset="7858657">For that matter, the sheriff's commissions are also computed in the same manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.810" offset="9630595">Mr. Chief Justice, I just like to make one or two very short points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.866" offset="9658807">As counsel for Equitable pointed out, the question of fixed in amount as spelled out in New Britain has not been spelled out in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.945" offset="9703111">But one thing ought to be very clear, if you can't tell whether the amount is something or another, as was the case here, it certainly not fixed in amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.290" offset="9748564">In this case, we're not talking about whether it was $10 or $12 or $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.852" offset="9770820">At the time the federal lien attached we didn't know where there was any dollars and in fact it might well and in the normal course of things would've been nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.860" offset="9834768">The respondent also faces great reliance on the 1912 or 1913 Act of Congress, which it says Cong -- in which it says Congress impended to protect a wide variety of interests pertaining to the mortgagee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.944" offset="9927137">Now the 1912 Act, which is now Section 6323, simply provides that until recorded the federal tax lien should be invalid as against mortgagees as well as against a variety of other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.014" offset="9991398">And it seems quite clear that it was designed simply to protect against the secret lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.323" offset="10020655">And as a matter of fact, the committee reports deal largely with the problem of the purchaser who doesn't know that a lien is attached to his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.496" offset="10065377">But there is reason to suppose that it intended to protect every device for augmenting a mortgagee's security against prospective risks whenever they might ripen into liabilities that mortgagee's lawyers could device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.403" offset="10152939">Indeed as this Court pointed out in Pioneer, Congress did not intend to purport or did not purport to affect the time at which local liens were deemed to arise or to become choate or to subordinate the tax lien to tentative, conditional or imperfect state liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.614" offset="10245831">Clearly when the federal lien arose here, Equitable's lien if there was one at that point was at best tentative conditional and imperfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.890" offset="10302882">Finally, I'd like to point out one other attribute of the New Jersey rule and of similar rules in a few other states that provide court counsel fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.892" offset="10354918">It seems to me, although I have not investigated the legislative history of many of these rules, that they were designed principally not to augment the mortgagee's reach, but rather to restrict it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.877" offset="10422836">They were designed to prevent overbearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.188" offset="10436106">They were designed to prevent overreaching and they did it by saying, as New Jersey says, no counsel fee shall be allowed no matter what the mortgage says except as provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.611" offset="10489814">And that's -- the theme runs through the several states that have such arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.431" offset="10517086">They were not designed to make integral to the mortgages property right as the Equitable would suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.706" offset="10558151">Some new claim but were designed to restrict overreaching on the part of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.277" offset="10588453">I don't think that gives a right that the Congress intended to protect at least until the time the liability arises.</text>
