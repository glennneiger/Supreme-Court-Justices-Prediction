            <text syncTime="19.014" offset="179388">-- and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.301" offset="192554">The United States is here on direct appeal under the Expediting Act from a final judgment of the District Court of the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.140" offset="239888">In this case, the United had sued under Section 7 of the Clayton Act to set aside the acquisition by the Pabst Brewing Company of the assets and business of the Blatz Brewing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.888" offset="310941">After the Government had put its evidence into the record and before the defendant submitted any evidence or attempted a rebuttal, the District Court granted defendant's motion for dismissal upon the ground that the plaintiff had shown no right to relief upon the facts and upon the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.111" offset="407803">The United States had alleged that the merger of these two substantial competing beer companies violated Section 7 because of probable anticompetitive effects in three markets, the sale of beer in Wisconsin; the sale of beer in the three-state region consisting of Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan; and the sale of beer in the United States as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.239" offset="532355">The District Court held that the evidence submitted by the United States had not established that either Wisconsin or the three-state region constituted valid geographic markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.203" offset="596198">The Court, therefore, confined its consideration of probable anticompetitive effects to the national market.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.008" offset="631411">But in making that evaluation, it refused to consider the fact that the merger occurred in an industry that was experiencing a pronounced trend toward concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.746" offset="690343">It refused to consider this fact because a showing had not been made that that concentration trend had resulted from mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.183" offset="740080">The District Court therefore concluded that by itself, evidence of the combined share of the national market held by Pabst and Blatz did not suffice to make the acquisition unlawful and the District Court dismissed the case with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.716" offset="826284">We believe that the District Court used an erroneous standard for the determination of a geographic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.284" offset="860557">Under a proper standard, we believe that the Government's unrebutted evidence compelled the conclusion that valid regional markets existed in Wisconsin and in the three-state region.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.638" offset="977899">But we believe that Wisconsin and the three-state areas are also relevant markets and perhaps more accurately reflect the impact of this merger.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin M. Zimmerman</label>
            <text syncTime="234.056" offset="1039548">The dismissal is inaccurate in that case too, Mr. Justice, because the judge refused to consider the fact that the merger took place in the context of a dramatically accelerating trend toward concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.823" offset="1102660">And therefore, we believe, that had he taken that fact into consideration as we believe he is required to, the merger would be unlawful even though measured on a national basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.545" offset="1157517">We believe that where these errors corrected, the errors of market definition and the errors of consideration of concentration trends, that the unrebutted case submitted by the Government, establishes a violation of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.234" offset="1220315">Accordingly, we propose that the case should be remanded to the District Court with instructions to that court to hear the defendant's evidence to determine whether the Government's showing has been rebutted.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.007" offset="1827401">I should like to divide my argument into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.724" offset="1838268">I would first want to review the question of what the appropriate standard for discerning a geographic market is, and I wish to attempt to show why the Government's unrebutted evidence suffice to prove that regional markets existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.165" offset="1908067">Secondly, I would wish to examine the standards applied by the District Court and indicate the error of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.005" offset="1947355">Finally, I would wish to indicate why under proper market definitions and given a proper consideration to concentration trends, we believe that the acquisition has been shown to be unlawful, unlawful at least, until such time as the defendants on remand can refute the Government's contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.680" offset="2054144">Turning to the question of geographic market definition, this problem has been before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.213" offset="2076191">You had it before the Court in the Philadelphia National Bank case, a Section 7 suit and it's also been before the Court in other context such as the Tampa Electric case and the Standard Oil case, Clayton Act cases under Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.258" offset="2148394">I doubt, however, that the issue has been presented as cleanly as it is here between the defendant's contention with which the District Court agrees that the sale of beer is a national market and the Government's contention that it has established that regional markets exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.176" offset="2228120">For purposes of analysis, I propose to deal principally with the State of Wisconsin and deal with the facts in the record on that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.482" offset="2261347">The results of that analysis, however, can be easily applied to the three-state area, the other region in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.880" offset="2298859">First, I should like to review the teaching of the Court on the question of delineation of a geographic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.394" offset="2328952">We are speaking here of a case involving a horizontal merger, and in such a case, there are at least two reasons why the question of the geographic dimension of the market is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.080" offset="2395721">For one, unless we know that outlines of the market, we would not in fact know that true horizontal competition existed if a firm sold in California and another firm sold in New York, it would not make sense to speak of a horizontal merger or horizontal competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.182" offset="2488090">We want to be sure that the firms are in the same geographic area competing one with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.503" offset="2517347">Secondly and more importantly, since for reasons which have been developed in all the Section 7 cases in this Court, market shares are a principle guide to the evaluation of probable anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.779" offset="2586520">It is essential that we have a geographic market definition that avoids meaningless market percentages.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.443" offset="2625181">Market percentages would be meaningless in the case of an improper geographic definition because the market may be so narrowly drawn as to yield huge and terrifying results when in fact no such economic consequence exists or market shares may be so broadly drawn as to water down the true economic consequences of a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.000" offset="2747329">Now, if we consider the purpose of market definition, the necessary implication is that what we wish to know is whether other sellers are capable of providing direct restraints on the ability of the merging firm to raise prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.482" offset="2845341">Let me illustrate what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.852" offset="2862791">I shall take two extreme cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.794" offset="2878568">Let us suppose we have 100 paper clip producers in Maryland and Virginia and the District of Columbia but mysteriously this month, only two sell in the District of Columbia and they merged.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.935" offset="2935097">To take advantage of the fact that this month these two constituted 100% of the sales in the District of Columbia by calling the District of Columbia a market, would be a meaningless act.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.032" offset="2991522">If after the merger, the company fills its oaths and raises its prices, it may be that every buyer in the District of Columbia will instantaneously switch to 98 other producers of paper clips in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.305" offset="3052544">In other words, to generalize, if other sellers can sell to consumers in the area as readily as those selling there, the definition of the District of Columbia as a geographic market is economically meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.732" offset="3114297">Now, to take the other illustration, let us assume we have two producers of concrete in and around the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.456" offset="3149197">We have other producers of concrete in Florida, New York, Tennessee, and points west.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.175" offset="3180022">A merger of the two local producers would cause concern since prices can be raised quite a bit before the buyers can economically turn to alternate sources of supply in distant parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.708" offset="3250239">Hence, in that case, it would be appropriate to say that sales in the District of Columbia are the market that the District of Columbia is the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.640" offset="5053942">Now, a second piece of evidence establishing that there locational advantages in the brewing industry, is the fact that Blatz, the acquired company which had but one brewery in Milwaukee, had in fact over the years sold most of its beer in the area proximate to Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.952" offset="5159163">In 1957, it sold 30% of its beer in Wisconsin alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.926" offset="5179120">It sold over 60% of its beer in the three-state area, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.515" offset="5205452">I submit that this again indicates clearly the presence of locational advantages associated with the production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.741" offset="5238366">Thirdly, I note that Pabst itself which had four breweries located throughout the country sold 50% -- made 50% of its sales in the four states in which it had breweries, Wisconsin, California, Illinois, and New York rather than New Jersey since the Newark brewery supplied New York, 50% of all Pabst sales were made where it had breweries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.731" offset="5354245">Fourth, I suggest that the record shows that most of the sales to Wisconsin buyers came from Wisconsin breweries or from breweries right across the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.410" offset="5408998">Over 90% of the sales of beer in Wisconsin came from Wisconsin or Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.854" offset="5430836">There were a few importers from Illinois but the overwhelming amount of beer consumed in Wisconsin came from breweries near Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.786" offset="5474513">I submit that this evidence together requires the conclusion that production -- location of production does necessarily affect competition and I suggest that this evidence at least gives us an outer limit in defining the sellers who can affect price restraints on the ability of the merging company to raise prices or exploit their market position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.961" offset="5599169">I suggest that only those breweries proximate to Wisconsin or in Wisconsin need be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.491" offset="5625292">Now, in addition to that outer limit and overlapping it, I suggest that there are major advertising and distributional elements in this case which again limit the ability of sellers to market in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.361" offset="5712854">I have at this point, I hope, defined the outer limits of possible sellers in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.152" offset="5731976">I shall now hope to show that within those outer limits, those companies that have made substantial investment in creating brand preferences and distributional outlets have a distinct and decided advantage over those companies that have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.625" offset="5797909">I wish to turn first to a statement by the Chairman of the Board of Pabst on page 130 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.026" offset="5835525">We find there that the Chairman Harris Perlstein testifies, this is a deposition, that you can only increase sales by winning more consumers to your brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.272" offset="5900413">The real sale struggle is the struggle between brands of beer and everything that goes with reaching the consumer place a part in increasing sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.877" offset="5938866">You've got to secure a distribution in retail outlets in a maximum number of retail outlets, that's point number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.952" offset="5963212">You've got to get your beer where people can buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.039" offset="5971571">You've got to present it through advertising, one kind or another, whether it would be media advertising or whether it would be what we call point of sale advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.134" offset="6003858">You've got to do all these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.582" offset="6009710">It's a many sided process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.595" offset="6021726">Secondly, on page 272 of the record, we got an indication of advertising expenditures in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.385" offset="6056939">We find that Pabst spent over $8 million in 1956 on advertising, over $8.5 million in 1958, the year of -- I'm sorry -- in 1957, the year before the merger, over $6 million in 1958, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.030" offset="6123499">We find that about three quarters of a million dollars were spent by Pabst in 1960 in Wisconsin alone, half a million dollars in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.131" offset="6159862">Obviously, this is an industry in which advertising is of critical importance as television will tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.801" offset="6198627">Another indication of the importance of brand preference which is indicated by this record is the phenomenon of Blatz prior to the merger, though, it had a far -- a smaller brewery in Milwaukee itself than Pabst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.664" offset="6278040">Nonetheless, outselling Pabst year in and year out in Wisconsin, it was as both companies were conveniently located and yet it was perfectly clear that Blatz had a greater grip on the Wisconsin market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.308" offset="6364557">Finally, we note that the prices charged the Wisconsin distributors for Blatz beer after the merger in 24 12-ounce bottles was higher than prices charged elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.419" offset="6445014">It would indicate that if one could differentiate in prices that a separate market exist.I wish to call the Court's attention --</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.808" offset="6782621">Now, I should like to ask the Court to look at Appendix B, in the Government's brief on page 50, because we think that the evidence set forth on that appendix -- this is the compilation of evidence in the record of course, can only lead to one conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.937" offset="6867153">What we see in Appendix B is a list of the identity of those selling in Wisconsin over a seven-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.085" offset="6915741">We also see their market shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.000" offset="6943326">If you look at the market shares and if you look at the identity of the sellers, one is struck by the remarkable uniformity of figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.518" offset="7005393">There are changes indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.326" offset="7016678">But if Wisconsin were meaningless, if Wisconsin had no economic significance, if those outside the Wisconsin market and not now selling there could instantaneously invade and pick up and sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.767" offset="7082402">If there were no significant barriers, we would not get this type of uniformity in identity and uniformity in market shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.384" offset="7132871">Now, the selection of Wisconsin in the first instance as a market area in which to measure the impact of the market was not fortuitous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.674" offset="7186056">Wisconsin is the home state of both breweries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.960" offset="7203192">The only Blatz brewery was in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.435" offset="7213119">A major Pabst brewery was in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.740" offset="7226284">Wisconsin was a very important state for both companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.138" offset="7239973">30% of Blatz's business had been done in Wisconsin, 13% of Pabst business had been done in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.575" offset="7265677">Far above what one would have expected to find had Wisconsin had been just another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.750" offset="7290337">Thirdly, we believe that state borders do have some relevance to the economic reality of the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.813" offset="7318653">There are regulations on advertising and promotion which are statewide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.799" offset="7334536">There is evidence in the record indicating that beer companies address their advertising and promotions on a statewide basis because of these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.616" offset="7377795">Fourth, Wisconsin has a unique importance as a beer consuming state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.974" offset="7395244">Beer is associated with Wisconsin and it has greater per capita consumption than any other state in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.457" offset="7417187">Fifth, it is a substantial market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.480" offset="7429308">Three million barrels of beer are sold in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.168" offset="7440071">The federal excise tax on sales of beer in Wisconsin amounted to $27 million alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.469" offset="7469223">Department of Commerce figures indicate a total beer industry of something like $6 billion, that Wisconsin represents 3.3% of total beer consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.874" offset="7514885">We have a Wisconsin market of $200 million not a de minimis market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.716" offset="7542262">We submit that the evidence in the record unrebutted at this point of locational advantages which sets the outer perimeter of those that can sell in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.990" offset="7603284">And of advertising and distributional advantages which suggest that those selling in Wisconsin now have a distinct advantage over those not now selling in Wisconsin whether located in Wisconsin or nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.892" offset="7666918">We suggest that these two factors are sufficient to establish that Wisconsin is a meaningful, not a perfect but a meaningful geographic market, a realistic market in which to evaluate the impact of this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.854" offset="7750823">The District Court was largely impressed by the fact that beer was shipped interstate and indeed it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.657" offset="7786036">But the District Court appeared unable to recognize the fact that regional markets could exist despite interstate shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.862" offset="7830862">This Court was able to find such markets in the Brown Shoe case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.534" offset="7853537">The District Court, we believe, erroneously deemed that absolute barriers to entry must exist, if a proper market were to be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.753" offset="7902333">We believe this is error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.509" offset="7913409">Perfect markets exist only in economic textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.972" offset="7931277">The District Court relied on the Tampa Electric case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.639" offset="7949876">In Tampa Electric, this Court looked to all the places that the sellers of coal sold to determine what portion of the market was foreclosed to those sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.267" offset="8012466">The District Court similarly looked to all the places that Pabst and Blatz sold and said this was the market but I submit that this is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.116" offset="8047888">The question in Tampa was foreclosure of opportunities to other sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.519" offset="8069413">The question here is foreclosure of opportunities to the Wisconsin consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.965" offset="8103267">In Tampa, there was no advertising expenditure by coal companies seeking to carry grand preferences from public utility companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.211" offset="8144227">Here, advertising is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.731" offset="8158333">In Tampa, the public utility went on the market every 10 or 20 years and indeed it would search up and down the country to find an adequate source of supply and a chief source of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.076" offset="8211728">Obviously, beer consumers have no such option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.728" offset="8230327">We believe that we are entirely consistent with the teaching of this Court in Tampa and with the Court's language in that case, which says that in defining the market, we must consider to whom the purchases can practicably turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.793" offset="8306500">And we submit that the purchasers can practicably turn to those now selling in the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.737" offset="8342340">I should like briefly to indicate why it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.966" offset="8363238">Assuming that the Government has established on the unrebutted evidence that Wisconsin is a market, why it is that we believe a violation of Section 7 has been shown by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.460" offset="8429171">I wish to note first that this is an industry which has undergone a radical transformation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.054" offset="8455607">In 1934, there were 708 brewing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.244" offset="8476400">In 1957, there were 206 brewing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.754" offset="8494373">In 1961, there were 162 brewing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.625" offset="8517883">Three out of every four brewing companies disappeared over this period yet national consumption of beer more than doubled over this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.473" offset="8557275">This clearly is an industry undergoing a highly unusual change.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.637" offset="13189935">That total represents about 60% of the excess production over consumption throughout the United States, which means that out of these three states of Wisconsin, Missouri, and Minnesota comes 60% of the supply for the 37 states that have deficit production in addition to imports in other states that have excess production over consumption like Wisconsin which is I say imports 25%.</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.354" offset="13960756">But counsel told the Court -- counsel told the Court and I'm quoting from the Record 425, the Court's opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.620" offset="14141837">The market for beer is localized and indeed the Government says that that is the basis of their contention and they are making the assertion to Your Honors that finding 30 to which they refer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3589.205" offset="14460217">They didn't call one of them in spite of the fact that they had represented to the Court that they have knowledge of these competitive conditions throughout the industry and that the Court should listen carefully to these witnesses in order to get this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.187" offset="14520090">And that the Court, as they represent here, should listen to these witnesses who would tell about the localized markets and they didn't call one of them to say so.</text>

            <label>Mr. John T. Chadwell</label>
            <text syncTime="3770.215" offset="15184227">Oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.377" offset="15184854">Yes, that's another point and I want to discuss that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.188" offset="15200110">But first, I would like to discuss the point which he dealt with primarily which is that Wisconsin is a relevant market area and that the Court's finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.459" offset="15253191">Now, I think I am correct in saying that the Government pays only lift service to the early stated guidelines of this Court in Philadelphia Bank -- the -- and in -- and in Tampa Electric which was incorporated and applied to Section 7 of the local bank, that a careful selection of the market area in which this owner operates and to which the purchaser can practically turn for supplies is the way in which a relevant market area should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.489" offset="15429360">Now, the Government is really trying to avoid this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.074" offset="15447646">It seems to us by trying to define the area in terms of existing sellers in Wisconsin -- sellers in Wisconsin rather than in terms of the section of the country which constitutes an area of effective competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.239" offset="15516296">It seems to be the Government's position as we understand it they may choose any area, in this case Wisconsin and the three-state area, where they deem the market shares to be favorable and rationalize it into an area of effective competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.225" offset="15592260">On the theory that there are barriers of some indefinite significance imposing some disadvantage on out-of-state sellers entering the market, and this, even though out-of-state sellers are already in Wisconsin and have been to a very great extent as I shall show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.291" offset="15676583">The Government in making this contention, I submit, ignores the first of the guidelines established in the Philadelphia Bank and that is, there must be a careful selection of the market area where the sellers operate as well as where the buyers may turn for supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.945" offset="15747114">In this case, almost 80%, 78% to be precise, of the beer brewed in Wisconsin is not consumed in Wisconsin at all but it's sold and shipped out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.465" offset="15821197">Under the first test in Philadelphia Bank, the area of effective competition must include Wisconsin plus the rest of the area far larger than Wisconsin where Wisconsin brewers and other brewers compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.450" offset="15885145">80% of the beer produced in Wisconsin is shipped out of the state to these deficit production areas and other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.463" offset="15941256">The Government made no effort to introduce any evidence as to the extent of the areas except for the sales and shipments which were stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.717" offset="15986291">They introduced no evidence as to the extent of sales of other Wisconsin brewers except Pabst and Blatz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.218" offset="16016280">Now, as to where the buyers in Wisconsin may turn for supplies, the evidence is as I said, the 25% of Wisconsin consumption is imported from other states despite Wisconsin's large surplus production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.842" offset="16082735">Wisconsin buyers turn to these out-of-state brewers for supplies and Wisconsin buyers and out-of-state buyers may and turn -- may and do turn to these brewers and their competitors in and out of Wisconsin constantly through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.701" offset="16150131">The evidence as we submit fails to sustain the Government's burden of proof on the facts by their own standards as to this supposed barriers to sales in Wisconsin by out-of-state brewers and certainly, they fail to comply with the Government's standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.704" offset="16226200">Now, the Government's basic assertion as I say is that the distribution of beer is localized that most beer sales by producers, and I am quoting, “are made within the immediate area of their breweries, that breweries considered important for effective distribution, that they have breweries proximate to their important market.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.645" offset="16338004">And they say and I quote, “This pattern holds across the nation in which 90% of all beers sold within the state come from brewers within the state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.614" offset="16381785">While the evidence does not show that, there is no evidence in the record for that at all, those are assertions made in their brief without any support in the record of any kind.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.730" offset="16442284">I would like to point out to the Court that since the Wisconsin brewers shipped almost 80% of their state -- of their production of beer to out-of-state consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.515" offset="16493484">They have done that for 1958, it was 78%; 1961, it was 76%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.299" offset="16532564">Furthermore, in 1958, Blatz had one brewery located in Milwaukee, the only one they have yet they sold beer and ship beer to 40 states in the United States out of that one brewery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.268" offset="16584495">They sold beer -- Pabst sold beer in all 48 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.412" offset="16604975">The record shows that the vast bulk of the sales of both Pabst and Blatz was made -- were made out of Wisconsin, Pabst, 78 -- 85% and Blatz, 77%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.392" offset="16668923">Almost 69% of the output of the Pabst brewery in Milwaukee was sold out of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.586" offset="16701733">And these shipments were made nationwide so far as Blatz was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.930" offset="16727124">They were made in a great many states so far as the Pabst brand of beer was concerned and those states included the Southeast, the West Coast, the Northwest and other areas either out of Peoria which is in Illinois or out of Milwaukee showing the widespread distribution of beer throughout United States from the Middle West, necessarily so, in view of this large excess production in these three states to which I have referred.</text>

            <text syncTime="4362.032" offset="17551548">There could be, I presume, it's conceivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.065" offset="17563669">There could be a relevant market area of effective competition in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.491" offset="17585298">I say that that's the area that they have chosen for the testing of this market along with the three-state area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.048" offset="17607555">They have chosen that and that they mention that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.962" offset="17615182">They haven't chosen any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.654" offset="17621974">So the question now is, is Wisconsin taken out for an example, is Wisconsin an area of effective competition?</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.596" offset="17653739">Can the sellers in Wisconsin look to brewers outside of the state for their beer as well as within the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.001" offset="17683414">If so, that broadens the area of effective competition and the percentages in Wisconsin are not controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.531" offset="17721448">The percentage are controlling as to the area which is one of effective competition within which customers or buyers can turn for supplies, and also, within which sellers competing in the area are actually in competition and I say to Your Honor that the sellers in Wisconsin can and do look far beyond the State of Wisconsin for supplies and that I have previously said that the sellers do complete -- compete over a very wide area much beyond Wisconsin and much beyond the three-state area because of this underlying economic fact of life which I stated to the Court at the outset of my remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.801" offset="17898559">Now, as further evidence of that Mr. Justice Fortas, I want to make this statement in which we considered to be of great importance to this decision and that is of the three top sellers in Wisconsin in 1961, three were out-of-state brewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.572" offset="17973687">Three were out-of-state brewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.597" offset="17981733">The second biggest producer, the second biggest seller in Wisconsin was Hamm's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.031" offset="18007542">The sixth biggest was Anheuser-Busch and the eighth biggest was (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.371" offset="18032828">They're all out-of-state producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.462" offset="18045262">Now, they have no breweries in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.846" offset="18062712">Now, it is true that Hamm's is located in St. Paul in Minneapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.190" offset="18084133">But St. Paul and Minneapolis is over 300 miles distance from the great population center of Wisconsin which is in the southern part including Milwaukee and Madison and those populous states across the southern part of -- populous counties across the southern part of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="4538.657" offset="18258004">St. Louis is where Anheuser-Busch is located.</text>

            <text syncTime="5896.648" offset="23690010">Before the recess, Mr. Justice Fortas had just inquire whether if I thought that the market share of Pabst and Blatz in Wisconsin were 95%, aggregated 95% sales that would make it a relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.970" offset="23763257">I don't think it would, Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.501" offset="23777364">I don't think it would unless it was otherwise a relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.087" offset="23811741">As a matter in fact, a very -- a very eminent economist have said that without first establishing a relevant market area, a percentage of sales have become whimsy, I think he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.447" offset="23869210">Now, why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.544" offset="23873599">I think that is because a high market share of Pabst and Blatz in Wisconsin, if Wisconsin is not a relevant market area, would not mean that Pabst and Blatz could control price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.423" offset="23933053">For example, let us for a moment, consider that the combined Pabst-Blatz sales in Wisconsin in 1961 where less than 9% of the beer produced in Wisconsin though they had a somewhat higher percentage, 24% was indicated, of the amount sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.032" offset="24047470">Now much of that production was by some of the largest breweries in the nation such as Schlitz and Miller and Heilman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5994.809" offset="24082578">Each of whom sold a great deal more out of Wisconsin than in Wisconsin, although, they made substantial sales thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.507" offset="24121448">So there was a very substantial amount of beer produced in Wisconsin, 80% of which was shipped out of the state leaving Pabst-Blatz sales only 9% of beer production.</text>
            <text syncTime="6024.663" offset="24202010">The huge amount of beer which was shipped out of the state could have been retained anytime in the state to control any effort at anticompetitive pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6039.538" offset="24261569">Likewise, brewers in the state or out of the state were shipping in 25% of total consumption in the state, yet, they had a large sales out of the state of course in addition if the Wisconsin price became anticompetitive if it had gotten out of line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.688" offset="24342131">They could have diverted a very large amount of their additional production into the state at the -- at a more attractive price if it was lower and that would have flooded the state with beer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.997" offset="24399391">So the very fact that those additional factors must be considered, the very fact that when they are considered, you remove any possible price restraint that Pabst or Blatz could have exercised in Wisconsin, shows that Wisconsin is not an area of effective competition by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6099.370" offset="24500851">You've got to consider these other areas as well and I think that the fact that they have 25% market share there is of no significance or the fact they might have had a higher market share.</text>
            <text syncTime="6114.550" offset="24561560">Because those facts that are in the evidence are rebutted, any inherently anticompetitive tendency that the shares might show.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.603" offset="24601788">I would like to make somewhat more specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="6128.272" offset="24616417">The comment that I made a little while ago in response to the argument of the Government that there's a proof that proximity to a brewery is of significance in the sales of market from the fact that a brewery was -- that Blatz started to increase its sales in California after they started making beer in the California brewery.</text>
            <text syncTime="6169.364" offset="24780779">That is not conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6170.811" offset="24786631">There is no explanation of it in this record and I point -- Mr. Justice Clark, I believe you commented on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.857" offset="24818813">I point to the fact that in New Jersey, Blatz began to be produced there in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="6190.968" offset="24867192">It began to be produced in Pabst plant there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6195.380" offset="24884851">In 1959, their sales went down from 31,000 barrels to 24,000 barrels.</text>

            <text syncTime="6412.692" offset="25754102">Now, I want to point out to the Court in that connection, first, as Mr. Zimmerman said, the national market shares were very, very small and in fact, a total of a little over 4% -- 4.7%, I guess, after the merger of national beer sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="6435.199" offset="25844172">And those sales were -- that percentage of national sales was less than it had been for Pabst alone in 1949 and 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.583" offset="25889729">Pabst have declined substantially in the intervening period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6452.090" offset="25911777">Now, with that in mind, let us consider the -- this reduction in the number of breweries from 750 to 162 over 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6465.222" offset="25964231">Now, there was no proof that any of this reduction was due to mergers and during that period, there has been a great depression.</text>

            <text syncTime="6757.268" offset="27132426">When Judge Tehan said that there was no evidence in the record of a trend toward concentration, he was using that term in his special sense, namely, a diminution in the number of companies due to mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6772.743" offset="27194389">The record is unrebutted in terms of the diminution in number of companies and we regard that of course as evidence of a trend toward concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="6783.676" offset="27238066">Secondly, this is a highly concentrated industry on a national level as well as in the regional markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6792.765" offset="27274428">The ten leading brewers on a national level accounted for 53% of all sales in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="6801.785" offset="27310477">The record referenced this on page 4 of the Government's brief and as I indicated earlier in Wisconsin, the top four brewers have over 50% of the market.</text>
