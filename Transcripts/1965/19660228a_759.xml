            <text syncTime="35.715" offset="248310">We'll wait just a few moments until they get seated.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Flynn</label>
            <text syncTime="68.134" offset="377981">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.453" offset="395222">This case concerned itself with the conviction of a defendant of two crimes of rape and kidnapping, the sentences on each count of 20 to 30 years to run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.467" offset="451333">I should point out to the court in an effort to avoid possible confusion, that the defendant was convicted in a companion case of the crime of robbery in a completely separate and independent act.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.433" offset="503160">However, the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona treated that conviction as a companion case in a companion decision, and portions of that record have been appended to the record in this case as it bears on the issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.109" offset="565854">Now the issue before the Court is the admission in evidence of the defendant's confession under the facts and circumstances of this case over the specific objections of his trial counsel that it had been given in the absence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.951" offset="641191">The trial court in June of 1963, prior to this Court's decision in Escobedo, allowed the confession into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.947" offset="681211">The Supreme Court of the State of Arizona in April of 1965, after this Court's decision in Escobedo, affirmed the conviction and the admission of the confession in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.706" offset="736277">This Court has granted us review.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.916" offset="749129">The facts in the case indicate that the defendant was a 23-year-old, Spanish-American extraction, that on the morning of March 13, 1963, he was arrested at his home, taken down to the police station by two officers named Young and Cooley.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.000" offset="825407">That at the police station, he was immediately placed in a line-up, he was there identified by the prosecutrix in this case and later identified by the prosecutrix in the robbery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.812" offset="876711">Immediately after the interrogations, he was taken into the police confessional at approximately 11:30 a.m. and by 1:30 they had obtained from him an oral confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.385" offset="934912">The interrogation room, described in the transcript as Interrogation Room No. 2, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.385" offset="962915">He had denied his guilt, according to the officers, at the commencement of the interrogation, by 1:30 he had confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.189" offset="994158">I believe that the record indicates that in no time during the interrogation, and prior to his confession, his oral confession, was he advised either of his rights to remain silent, or his right to counsel, or of his right to consult with counsel, nor indeed, was such the practice in Arizona at that time as admitted by the officers in their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.424" offset="1091124">The defendant was then asked to sign a confession to which he agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.991" offset="1109410">The form handed to him to write on contained a typed statement as follows which precedes his handwritten confession - “I, Ernesto A. Miranda, do hereby swear that I make this statement voluntarily and of my own free will, with no threats, coercion, or promises of immunity, and with full knowledge of my legal rights, understanding any statement I make may be used against me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="278.910" offset="1221110">This statement was read to him by the officers, and he confessed in his own handwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.268" offset="1246501">Throughout the interrogation, the defendant did not request counsel at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.296" offset="1266563">In due course, the trial court appointed counsel to defend him in both cases and the defense counsel requested a psychiatric examination, which has been made a court the -- and the medical report has been made a portion of the transcript of the record in this case as it enlightens us to a portion or some of the factual information surrounding the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.581" offset="1447748">In this respect, I would answer Your Honor's question by referring to page 51 of the petitioner's brief, to the appendix -- or excuse me, page 52.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.951" offset="1561224">Answer,‘‘No, sir.”</text>

            <text syncTime="370.912" offset="1716809">Question, “Did you warn him of his rights to an attorney?”</text>
            <text syncTime="374.961" offset="1716705">Mr. Moore, “We object, not voluntarily given.”</text>
            <text syncTime="377.910" offset="1716600">Mr. Turoff, “I don't believe that is necessary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="379.892" offset="1716496">The Court, “Overruled.”</text>
            <text syncTime="381.580" offset="1716391">On page 53, the succeeding page, a portion of the same record indicates further cross-exam -- further examination concerning this conversation, “Had you offered” -- I am starting approximately one-third down the page, “Had you offered the defendant any immunity?”</text>
            <text syncTime="404.530" offset="1723496">“In your presence, had Officer Cooley done any of these acts?”</text>
            <text syncTime="407.612" offset="1735826">Answer,“No, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="409.184" offset="1742200">Question, “About what time did this conversation take place, Officer?”</text>
            <text syncTime="413.101" offset="1757874">Answer,“Approximately 1:30.”</text>
            <text syncTime="416.060" offset="1769681">“Shortly after Mrs. McDaniels made her first statement, is that correct?”</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="435.333" offset="1846794">I was referring to page 4 of your brief upon which you said that Officer Young believes that Miranda was told that he need not answer those questions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_flynn" startTime="446.981" stopTime="894.645">
            <label>Mr. John J. Flynn</label>
            <text syncTime="446.981" offset="1893292">I was about to continue, if Your Honor please, to page 54, at which we find the question, “You never warned him he was entitled to an attorney or anything he said would be held against him, did you?</text>
            <text syncTime="457.655" offset="1936029">Answer, “We told him anything he said would be used against him, he wasn't required by law to tell us anything.”</text>
            <text syncTime="464.736" offset="1964345">And consequently, this would answer Your Honor's question, except bearing in mind that the record clearly reveals that from the lineup and the identification to the interrogation room, the officers established the time as 11:30, and that the confession was completed and signed at 1:30.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.273" offset="2038533">Reading the testimony of the robbery conviction, it is apparent to me that the officers, when they recite or answered on page 54 of the transcript that he had been advised of his rights, were again relating to this formal typed heading, which would be at 1:30, at the time he signed a confession, that hence, there really is no conflict in the record as to when he was advised of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.772" offset="2156502">The further history relating to this defendant found in the psychiatric examination would indicate that he had an Eighth Grade education.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.902" offset="2188999">And its found by the Supreme Court that he had a prior criminal record and that he was mentally abnormal.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.435" offset="2215121">He was found, however, to be competent to stand trial and legally sane at the time of the commission of the alleged acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.824" offset="2244692">Now, the critical aspect of the defendant's case -- confession, I think, is eminently demonstrated when during the trial the prosecutrix was asked the question concerning penetration, in which she first responded that she was -- that she thought it was by finger, under questioning by the prosecuting attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.999" offset="2321387">Immediately thereafter, she expressed uncertainty as to the manner or method of penetration and after some prompting, responded to the prosecuting attorney that it had been in fact, by the male organ.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.135" offset="2373945">On cross-examination, she again expressed the uncertainty in relation to this penetration which of course is the essential element of the crime of first-degree rape in the State of Arizona, when she did -- responded to his question that she simply was unsure whether it had been by finger or by penis.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.574" offset="2451686">Now of course, the defendant's confession neatly corrects this “reasonable doubt” that otherwise would have been engendered, when in precise terminology he wrote, “Asked her to lie down, and she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.400" offset="2502990">Could not get penis into vagina, got about one-half (half-written) inch in.”</text>
            <text syncTime="607.894" offset="2536950">The only thing missing or the only thing that the officers failed to supply in words to this defendant at the time he wrote this confession was in violation of Section 13-611, Arizona Revised Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.257" offset="2590448">Then of course, they would have had the classic confession of conviction because they could have argued that the man even knew the statutory provisions relating to rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.281" offset="2626497">The state as I read their response, takes no issue with the statement of facts as I've outlined them to this Court, except to say that we overstate his mental condition and minimize his educational background.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.229" offset="2678324">And also the concern that is expressed by Mr. Justice Fortas concerning at what stage of the proceeding he may have been advised of his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.497" offset="2727434">Now, the petitioner's position on the issue is simply this, the Arizona Supreme Court, we feel, has imprisoned this Court's decision in Escobedo on its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.321" offset="2774664">And by its decision is refusing to apply the principles of that case and for all practical purposes has emasculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.335" offset="2810713">Certainly every court desiring to admit a confession can find distinguishing factors in Escobedo from the fact situation before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.277" offset="2854494">I would like to very briefly quote from the transcript of the record which contains the Arizona decision at page 87.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.967" offset="2889289">"It will be noted that the Court in the Escobedo case set forth the circumstances under which a statement would be held admissible, namely, one, the general inquiry into an unsolved crime must have begun to focus on a particular suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.485" offset="2963372">Two, the suspect must have been taken into police custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.272" offset="2982494">Three, the police in its interrogation must have elicited an incriminating statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.677" offset="3008094">Four, the suspect must have requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.336" offset="3038814">Five, the police must not have effectively warned the suspect of his constitutional rights to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.773" offset="3068489">When all of these five factors occur, then the Escobedo case is a controlling precedent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="747.915" offset="3097119">Now, the Arizona Supreme Court having built or having indicated its clear intention to imprison the Escobedo decision set about to do precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.953" offset="3149260">First, as to the focusing question, it indicated that this crime had occurred at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.221" offset="3174337">And consequently, despite the positive identification of the defendant by two witnesses, which the state urged were entirely fair lineups, the Supreme Court of Arizona indicated that even then perhaps under these facts, attention had not focused upon this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.990" offset="3245390">I think this is sheer sophistry and would indicate the obvious intent of the Arizona Supreme Court to confine Escobedo and to distinguish it whenever possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.465" offset="3291261">Next, the court found that the defendant was advised of his rights in the reading of the typed portion immediately preceding its transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.781" offset="3320519">They permitted that document to lift itself by its own bootstraps so to speak, and to indicate that here was a man who was knowledgeable concerning his legal rights, despite the facts and circumstances of his background and his education.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.191" offset="3374226">And they further found that he was knowledgeable because he had a prior criminal record, though in the decision he indicated this would be knowledge of his rights in court and certainly not his rights at the time of the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.211" offset="3438279">I think the numerous briefs filed in this case indicating the substantial split in the decisions throughout the various states, the Circuits and the Federal District Courts, indicate the interpretation that has been placed upon Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.455" offset="3507242">On the one hand, we have the California decision in Dorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.973" offset="3525319">We have the Third Circuit's decision in Russo, which would indicate that principle and logic are being applied to the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.958" offset="3553217">And in the words of Mr. Justice Goldberg, that when the process shifts from the investigation to one of accusation, and when the purpose is to elicit a confession from the defendant, then the adversary process comes into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.893" offset="3625002">On the other hand, the other cases that would distinguish this have found and give rise to what I submit is not really confusion by merely straining against the principles and logic in that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.931" offset="7365110">And yet from 1914 until this Court's decision in Mapp versus Ohio, we simply did not enjoy the Fourth Amendment rights or the scope of the Fourth Amendment rights that were enjoyed by most of the other citizens of the other states of this Union, and those persons who were under federal control.</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.159" offset="7774083">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.353" offset="7786830">Counsel somewhat caught up in where to begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.793" offset="7812639">I think perhaps the first and most important -- to one of the most important things to say right now is concerning Mr. Flynn's last remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.296" offset="7850569">I, as a prosecutor, even of only short duration, take serious issue, strenuous -- strenuous issues I can take before this Court, in the statement that it will take another 46 years in the State of Arizona for the right to counsel to become full blown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.813" offset="7936669">I just simply think there is no reason for that statement to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.129" offset="7957985">If there is any reason for it to be made or any possible justification for it to be made then there is no point in going any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.730" offset="7996332">One issue that might be a good starting point is concerning the description of the Arizona Court's supposed “off-the-cuff” referral to or ignoring of the Escobedo decision, or the attempt to avoid it clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.294" offset="8078566">There is no such thing in the Arizona Supreme Court opinion, and the reading of it shows that they agreed that they must follow this Court, not begrudgingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.368" offset="8118899">They simply stated that it's a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.107" offset="8129870">And then in exploring the case of Escobedo, the case of Miranda, they tried to find out what happened in Miranda, what the case of Escobedo says, and apply those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.893" offset="8196953">There's no attempt to avoid, and I don't think you can read it implicitly or otherwise in the Arizona Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.792" offset="8240630">Clearly they did not base it on a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.315" offset="8254631">They did not say we have A, B, C, D, E and D wasn't present, therefore it's not controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.262" offset="8278455">That is not what they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.944" offset="8285247">They said many courts in other jurisdictions had gone off on that particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.884" offset="8304995">They mentioned that as a factor, but they discussed hundreds of -- not hundreds, many other factors in Miranda, which differentiated it from Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.179" offset="8342089">To get to the facts in Miranda, I think it's very clear from the record that Mr. Miranda, as an individual defendant, does not particularly require any special rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.255" offset="8414396">I certainly agree with Justice Black 100%, that the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment, every other part of our Constitution applies to everyone -- poor, rich, ignorant, intellectual, what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.826" offset="8464760">There is no possible basis for differentiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.712" offset="8476254">I don't argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.445" offset="8479180">I don't think any prosecutor I've note argues it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.460" offset="8495271">But Miranda, I think, characteristically by the petitioner, is portrayed in this light in an attempt to make something that isn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.051" offset="8545635">Sure, he only went through the Eighth Grade, and one of the psychiatrist said that he had an emotional illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.686" offset="8580117">I might say, there is another psychiatric report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.944" offset="8601224">It's not in the printed record, and I just discovered it in my file, but it is in the record before this Court, the record that was on appeal, and I would urge the Court to advert to that psychiatric report also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.116" offset="8653887">And as to the fact that Mr. Miranda could not have made the statement that he made, I just don't think there is any basis for alleging that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.123" offset="8693906">The fact that he uses the words, the medical words to describe the male and female sex organ rather than some four-letter vernacular words that he might have used, this doesn't condemn him of -- just because he knew those words and maybe felt in this context in writing the statement that he could use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.799" offset="8780633">There is no indication in the record that the police put these words in his mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.590" offset="8795784">The fact that this particular one-half inch penetration is something that the police conjured up in his mind is just simply not supportable by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.967" offset="8849283">You read the psychiatric report and that is in the record and he said he was upset when he found out that she had not had sexual relations before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.928" offset="8885123">Well, she told him that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.885" offset="8888989">The only way he found out was because, obviously from the record, as he said, he was only able to make penetration, only a slight way, simply because of the fact that the woman's hymen had not been ruptured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.002" offset="8953459">This is a clear, factual as to -- that he knew why he made that statement and why it was accurate, not a fabrication of the police officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.962" offset="9949247">My position basically is -- concerning the warning, is that each case presents a factual situation in which the court would have to determine or a court or a judge or prosecutor at some level would have to make a determination as to whether or not a defendant because of the circumstances surrounding his confession was denied a specific right, whether it be right to counsel, the right to not be compelled to testify against himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.836" offset="11588796">I don't believe the Arizona Court has specifically said that warnings as such are of a constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.014" offset="11625472">The court has said that in some cases warnings may be required in a given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.289" offset="11654625">And in fact, in the Goff case, which I cite as the next case in the Arizona Court's determination, they say it's important that the -- that all steps be taken at the earliest possible time when they are indicated by the fact situation to ensure that the state doesn't overreach and that the man is given every benefit of his rights under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.086" offset="11729753">But I don't believe they have yet said as a constitutional dimension any specific warning at any specific situation needs be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.062" offset="11773639">Its my argument concerning the factors surrounding Escobedo that if Escobedo is a completely distinct and separate determination of a Sixth Amendment right, as divorced from the Fifth Amendment right, which I think is pretty hard to do, then in order for it to be meaningful and effective, not just to the defendants but to the people of the state, of the country, it's got to announce a rule which forbids affirmative conduct on the basis of police officers or prosecutors calculated in a given situation to deny the man the implementation of his right, whether it be the right to counsel or the right against compulsory self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.114" offset="11993903">As I understand it, there is no right not to incriminate himself, the right is for him not to be compelled, whether it's subtle compulsion or direct, but it is still a right not to be compelled to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.395" offset="12050954">At least this is my understanding and he doesn't have a right not to self -- not to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.191" offset="12078226">He has a right not to be compelled to incriminate himself by some means, either direct or devious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.020" offset="12117514">Now, I think if the extreme position is adopted that says he has to either have counsel at this stage, or intelligently waive counsel, that a serious problem in the enforcement of our criminal law will occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.105" offset="12401831">He has not talked to his defendant that he's appointed, let's say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.544" offset="12411549">He was appointed to an indigent, an indigent defendant who says, “I want a lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.148" offset="12453972">Now, first of all he stops the interrogation telling -- talk to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.546" offset="12463585">I would think he -- if he is going to represent him, he cannot allow him to say anything until he finds out what his story is, what he is going to stay -- is going to -- how it is going to affect him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3567.050" offset="14373658">This brings another thing into play, I believe, which is vitally important, and the prosecutors in my state consider it so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.101" offset="14401870">That if in fact, you either have counsel or you don't, and it thereby seriously circumscribes interrogation and confession, you eliminate an early part of one of the most important principles, hopefully, in our criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.068" offset="14469684">And that is not just to convict, not just to deter, not just to put somebody away, but to rehabilitate and at the earliest possible moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.708" offset="14500300">And I don't have that many personal experiences, so (Inaudible) -- we had a meeting with the prosecutors in our state and many of the cases involving confessions in pre-trial interrogation where the cases were -- whether a man has at least admitted he has done something wrong or cases where the defendants were much more susceptible to rehabilitation at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.356" offset="14598834">If you foreclose this, then you develop an attitude in the police officers, you take the personal attitude away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.187" offset="14626210">Many a hardened police officer, who needs -- developed a case of tremendous circumstantial evidence against a man, and yet the man sits there and keeps telling him “I didn't do it,” he is going to wonder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.873" offset="14676888">There's a personal factor there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.930" offset="14681172">He is going to wonder, “Why doesn't this man confess?</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.018" offset="14689531">Why doesn't he say something about doing it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.486" offset="14699353">Even assuming now arguendo that it's not coercion that we've -- I have no argument that whatever is considered coercion, whether it's subtle or otherwise, should not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.763" offset="14740522">But assuming the interrogation is good, except for that, he is going to wonder, and maybe he is going to go out and examine that eyewitness who saw him at 2 o'clock in the morning under a dark street light and examine this other evidence because he wonders that personal element, he ought to confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.387" offset="14810948">Here is all the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.206" offset="14814292">It's a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.449" offset="14827248">This is wiped out completely if you terribly circumscribed this particular pre-trial invest -- this (Inaudible) -- personal element is out, and he can say, “Well, I got the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.591" offset="14867790">Maybe he's guilty, maybe he's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.669" offset="14872074">I didn't talk to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.334" offset="14874791">I don't know how he acts or to be -- how he turns up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.594" offset="14887748">And I think its defendants could be heard as much as the -- as the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3717.847" offset="14976773">Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.788" offset="14988581">The State of New York is appearing not only in the present case, Miranda case, but in the ensuing four cases that have been scheduled for consecutive arguments in which these problems of the right to the assistance of counsel are raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.075" offset="15065694">I think the state has appeared here as amicus on numerous previous occasions when there has been a constitutional question in the general field of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.191" offset="15110207">The nature of our interest is stated in the opening pages of the brief and I do not believe that I need to elaborate that orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.081" offset="15149704">Excuse me -- I should add, the brief that has been circulated to the other states and has been joined by something over half -- I think about 27 other states, as well as Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.114" offset="15213861">Now, I will try to say what I have to say in less than the allotted time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.117" offset="15229848">And my task, its brevity is the easier because of some things I might otherwise say, I think will be said much better by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.277" offset="15262553">And I also try to say a few things that, as I read the briefs, no one else is going to say or at least say in the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.013" offset="15297452">The factor common to all five of these cases is that a confession as received in evidence which was taken when counsel were not present and when there had been no waiver of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.902" offset="15353041">And therefore a contention that runs commonly through all five of them, that is the one that emerged I think most clearly and that's Mr. Justice Black's question as to whether this is a matter of constitutional dimension under the Fifth Amendment, or for that matter the Sixth, or the Due Process Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3840.541" offset="15467562">All in the -- in a state of detention, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.164" offset="15482086">Otherwise than that, there is quite a spectrum of circumstances that these cases reveal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.973" offset="15505283">The -- of the surrounding circumstances are not uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.922" offset="15525136">Now, may I just state what the thrust of our position is very briefly before indicating likewise its limits and why we are taking this position?</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.462" offset="15563274">Our contention is that insofar as these cases present a constitutional claim that a valid confession cannot be taken unless counsel is present or has been waived, that that claim in constitutional terms in the constitutional dimension is not sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.678" offset="15640179">In other words, Justice Black's question we would answer in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.051" offset="15653658">The Fifth Amendment cannot be, should not be read as requiring counsel to be present at the time the confession is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.820" offset="15688662">I will come to my reasons for that very presently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.593" offset="15703813">Our secondary position is that if the court should decide to enunciate a rule of that sort in constitutional terms or other new rules pertaining to the validity of pre-arraignment confessions, those should not be applied retroactively but should be prospective only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.745" offset="15796391">Now, before speaking in support of those two positions and I intend to spend most of my time on the first one, may I make clear the limits of our position here and what we are not saying, because I think this is of almost equal importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.767" offset="15856473">We are not taking any position for either affirmance or reversal of any of these five cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.327" offset="15886775">That is because all five of them, as we see it, involve problems or possible problems that go beyond the limits of our contention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.846" offset="15928780">In the Miranda case, its just been argued, there is obvious to this -- division of opinion about the characteristics of the defendant, about whether the warning that Mr. Justice Fortas' questions were directed to, was given at a meaningful stage, what the significance of that warning is in legal terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.586" offset="16003803">The other five cases involve questions of trial procedure in which we are not presently interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.752" offset="16028463">They also, two of them involved a long period of detention from which counsel are making arguments derived from the McNabb-Mallory principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.716" offset="16068274">We are not taking a position on those matters and therefore we could not say that in any one of these five cases we are supporting an affirmance or reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.451" offset="16111219">Secondly, may I make quite clear that we are not saying that new rules about requiring counsel to be present when an inter -- whether an investigation is taken, interrogation is made or a confession taken, we are not saying that such rules are necessarily unwise, without merit.We say that these are not matters of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.478" offset="16219366">But we do not say that they might not be very wise rules to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.601" offset="16235875">In fact, we are saying that this whole problem of the assistance of counsel at the pre-arraignment stage can we think be more appropriately and perhaps better dealt with in the legislative dimension and in the area of judicial policy rather than on purely constitutional terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.978" offset="16309332">Now, of course, insofar as we say there's no constitutional basis here, our position cuts against the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.801" offset="16336603">But as I repeat, we are not taking a position against such rules found in other ways, through legislative means, through judicial policy, or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.142" offset="16381952">Now, may it please the Court, the inclusion of these five cases, one federal case, the Westover case, Number 761, I think underlines this distinction that I have been endeavoring to state, and it also discloses the one respect in which I think our position departs from that which taken by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.754" offset="16472440">As a federal case, this being a confession taken by federal agents introduced in evidence in a federal prosecution, I would suppose that the Westover case is susceptible of disposition in non-constitutional terms under this Court's federal supervisory jurisdiction, as enunciated in the McNabb-Mallory cases and that general line of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.216" offset="16578288">As I read the Solicitor General's brief, however, he is saying not only that the Constitution does not raise a requirement of the presence of counsel, but is also saying that such a rule should not be laid down by this Court as a matter of judicial policy in the way it was done in McNabb and Mallory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.179" offset="16662089">Our position does not extend to that second step.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.399" offset="16675046">We do not take any position one way or the other on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.420" offset="16691137">I think it entirely appropriate to say though that that would be a dimension in which we would consider this Court might very appropriately deal with the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="4303.583" offset="17319748">But when the further question was raised in a case where counsel arrived at the station while a confession was being taken, the state made the contention that that part of the confession that took place before counsel arrived could be admitted and not the latter part.</text>

            <text syncTime="4322.520" offset="17395503">I just want to say that I think the problem is whether it's not too late in the day to make that kind of a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.064" offset="17425701">I'm asking the question, that is to say that once this Court has made the rulings that it has made in Gideon and Escobedo, I wonder if it's still much availed to argue that we ought to draw the kind of line that you're suggesting here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="4347.829" offset="17496754">Well, that brings me back to Mr. Justice Black's question and its relation to the ones you have been putting, Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.830" offset="17524757">And that is whether there is anything in the Constitution, either in the Sixth Amendment Assistance of Counsel Clause, or in the Due Process Clause, or in the protection against self-incrimination, whether any of those clauses together or conjointly should be read as requiring counsel in the pre-arraignment stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.267" offset="17606468">Now it seems to me that if one is going to approach that question, one must enunciate a constitutional theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.207" offset="17638233">Are we looking to history and original meaning of the Constitution or are we looking to contemporary standards?</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.253" offset="17670416">Is the Constitution to be treated as fluid with different and perhaps more rigorous meanings obtained by common consent at a later time, or are we to look to the original understandings, it has been called?</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.773" offset="17724541">Now, I suggest, with all respect, Mr. Justice Fortas, that in those terms it's very difficult to support the contentions being made here and the situation is quite different from Gideon, quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.706" offset="17776264">I forget the exact number of states that already were furnishing counsel in all criminal trials at the time of Gideon, but my recollection is that there wasn't more than a handful that weren't already doing this as a matter of state practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.560" offset="17835614">Therefore, one had a very broad practice and consensus in the states on this very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.173" offset="17866125">The same thing, if I may say so, was true in the Mapp case, to a lesser extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.171" offset="17890053">In Mapp, you had about half the states that were applying the exclusionary rule and the trend was solidly in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.709" offset="17920251">California had changed its view between Wolf and Mapp so that in both of these situations you had a solid basis in practical experience in the states and really, your decision was not revolutionary in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.666" offset="17976048">But, in the dimension that we're now talking about, I don't know of a single state that presently excludes confessions that are taken pre-arraignment in the absence of counsel.I don't think there is such a jurisdiction.</text>
