            <text syncTime="12.074" offset="151698">-- may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.916" offset="159013">At recess yesterday, I was discussing the first of the two Arkansas laws here in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.812" offset="186598">The 1907 Act which prescribes a minimum crew on freight trains operated in Arkansas meeting its specifications of six members directing that they be engineer, fireman, conductor and three brakemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.737" offset="246366">The Act provides those requirements by its own terms regardless of any modern equipment that maybe placed on the trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.586" offset="285759">The Act prescribes a penalty of not less than $100, not less than $500 every train run to constitute a separate violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.720" offset="334242">The six plaintiff railroads in this case operate thousands of trains in Arkansas each year which is not operated in accordance with the provisions of the Act, staff with six men would constitute a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.938" offset="391084">The exceptions contained in the Act or that it does not apply to railroads having less than 50 miles of line and that it does not apply to trains with less than 25 cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.808" offset="446568">The other Act passed in 1913 prescribes a similar crew of six men for switch crews operated in Arkansas meeting its specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.357" offset="488782">A similar penalty with a similar provision that every switch crew operated without complying with it shall constitute a separate violation is contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.158" offset="527966">Its exceptions are to railroad companies with less than 100 miles of line.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.963" offset="551267">I will discuss later this morning the effect of the 100-mile and the 50-mile exceptions as they bring the impact to these statutes on the interstate railroads operating in Arkansas only and fully exempt the 17 intrastate railroads from the burdens of these Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.129" offset="627858">If other exception in the switch crew law is that it does not apply to switching operations which are conducted outside of cities of the second class and not over public crossings.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.507" offset="673416">The exception with respect to switching operations not in cities of the first or second class which is the way the statute describes it is not meaningful and that in Arkansas, a city of the second class is one with at least 500 inhabitants but there are provisions whereby lesser towns can vote to become cities of the second class without having the requisite 500 inhabitants.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.938" offset="767143">That exclusion probably has no application to any switching operation in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.085" offset="795669">These statutes of Arkansas are the most extreme form of this type of legislation that the states have undertaken to enact.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.655" offset="829942">No similar statutes have been undertaken by Arkansas nor by any other state to my knowledge to burden competing forms of transportation such as buses and trucks and barges and airplanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.703" offset="886157">The states do not undertake to prescribe the level of crew operation or the level of crew staffing for passenger buses for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.949" offset="939133">It is extreme in the sense that it's the most extreme regulation in the sense that among the seven states that still have operable crew consist statutes Arkansas being one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.370" offset="996812">None of them provide for a higher level of manning than the Arkansas' six men freight crew statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.411" offset="1028995">None of them provide other than Arkansas for -- has higher level as the six men switch crew statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.092" offset="1059715">There are no other full-crew statutes that purport to prescribe so high a requirement as the Arkansas switch crew statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.852" offset="1094823">Arkansas has historically had the most burdensome of these full-crew statutes which no doubt accounts for the fact that it is the Arkansas statutes that had been before this Court for examination on several occasions.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.844" offset="2318712">The District Court has carefully gone through them, it has filed an opinion something in excess of 50 pages analyzing that legislative history and its conclusion which I think fully is sustained by so much of the legislative history as it is contained in those proceeding before Congress was if any rational conclusion is to be drawn from a legislative history on the question, it is that Congress intentionally elected not to include a saving provision for such laws and thereby create local exceptions to the authority of the Arbitration Board to fix the size of train crews on a nationally uniformed basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.030" offset="2499480">That is the conclusion of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.214" offset="2508257">The District Court also pointed out that no one urged to it that this law was ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.319" offset="2536678">I point out here that no one has suggested to this Court that the law was ambiguous and indeed it is not, no one is -- no one has had any difficulty in applying or determining what this law means.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.900" offset="2586937">And the District Court recognized that in light of the teachings of this Court in many cases that when the intention of Congress is clearly expressed in its enactment, it's unnecessary to explore through volumes of Congressional debates and hearings in order to attempt to find some contrary conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.931" offset="2699055">It seems to me that there's supreme definite history there that would call for a very serious discussion by you?</text>
            <text syncTime="657.054" offset="2731551">For instance, the Secretary Wirtz who represented the administration that proposed the bill is alleged to that but told to the House Committee that state full-crew laws would be unaffected and the House Committee reported that the award would not supersede state crew laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.944" offset="2823189">I'm just saying what is alleged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.063" offset="2835623">And the chairman of the ICC told the Senate Committee that the legislation would not affect state laws and the chairman of the House Committee told his chamber that state laws would not be infringed and the General Counsel of ICC did very much the same thing and its also alleged that the carriers themselves recognized and stated at that time that it did not affect these laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.150" offset="3115969">And he then asked Secretary Wirtz if he could point to him where in either this legislation or the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.907" offset="3143032">It was provided that no preemption of this crew consists laws would be accomplished and the Secretary conceded that there were no such provisions and Congressman Harris asked if he would submit a legal memorandum on the point so that thorough research could be before the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.402" offset="3212936">And the memorandum was then submitted and it was to the contrary of what the Secretary had originally suggested was his opinion and that is that quite likely this legislation in its then formed and this was the administration legislation I thought was ultimately passed would preempt the pro-consist statutes and then the interstate commerce -- and following that, all of the rest of the comments that pop up through the hearings and debate usually related back to what Secretary Wirtz's original opinion that he gave the House Committee was but --</text>

            <text syncTime="1330.914" offset="5427075">The manning of trains have been prior to that time determined by local rules, arrangements, collective bargaining agreements, crew consist laws on a local basis with a sole exception that the firemen were placed on trains on the night -- on the basis of the 1937 diesel agreement which was a national agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.473" offset="6705298">In Arkansas, there are 17 intrastate railroads operating exclusively within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.690" offset="6730167">These laws by virtue of the 50-mile and 100-mile exemptions exempt all 17 from the burdens of both laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.860" offset="6766843">On the other hand, the 1907 statute with the 50-mile exemption applies to 10 of the 11 interstate railroads operating across Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.788" offset="6806549">The 1913 Act applies to eight of the 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.787" offset="6822536">It's put in better perspective as to the real impact on the interstate commerce is distinguished from intrastate commerce when it's exempt -- examined the impact to these statutes is examined in light of the interstate railroad truckage in Arkansas to which it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.625" offset="6885857">In both instances, each statute applies to well over 99% of the interstate railroad truckage operated in Arkansas whereas it applies to zero percent of the railroad truckage of the intrastate railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.864" offset="6946879">It seems to be the settle rule that while a state can burden commerce to a certain extent if it does it reasonably and the test is measuring on the one hand the local interest against the national interest on -- of an unfettered transportation system and unfettered interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.420" offset="7025037">The corollary of the rule is that a state cannot burden commerce, it can't direct the burden against commerce thereby favoring or against intrastate commerce thereby favoring its local interest and giving it a competitive advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.183" offset="7084074">Our adversaries don't really seek to answer this argument, they did not seek that -- answer it before the bar, this Court, the only suggestion contained in their briefs is that this might be something that the District Court could take some proof on to see what the effect to these statutes are on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.427" offset="7157112">If this were an undue burden argument, certainly that would be right, it takes extensive proof to make that sort of weighing but this is discrimination which this Court had said is absolutely forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.858" offset="7198804">And the only relevant proof that can be made is in this record and it is undisputed and that is that the discrimination is there, it falls only on the interstate railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.221" offset="7236211">And perhaps to add a little bit to it, I don't that it is essential that the discrimination is really a significant that the impact is significant and the cause of compliance that's contained and is undisputed in this record, proves that this is something that costs $6 million to $8 million a year to these railroads just to comply of these statutes that fall on the interstate railroads alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.492" offset="7433383">It was the Senate that was warned particularly by Mr. Ginnane, the General Counsel of the ICC about the possibly preemptive effect of legislation and the Senate did not include the saving clause and the Senate Report does not include any reference one way or the other to be sure as to what the intent of the Senate Committee was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.656" offset="7649991">The main factors that seem to dominate on that are found on pages 8 and 9 of the Senate Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.956" offset="7683218">And the problem seem to have been the workload of the Interstate Commerce Commission and also some feeling on the part of the Brotherhoods that they would not get as fair shape before the Interstate Commerce Commission in terms of what they wanted as they would before in Arbitration Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.735" offset="8034304">But the -- but that was not the approach that Congress came out with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.688" offset="8050082">What the Congress came out with the approach of the Railway Labor Act, Arbitration Board within that framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.521" offset="8097416">I think in this whole consideration of legislative history, we tend to lose sight of one thing that the -- if we assume from anything short of the expressed language of Congress in the Act that Congress wanted the state laws to remain in effect states to have powers to pass and to put into effect laws in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.457" offset="8229177">We are creating a situation in which Congress in effect could've permitted the entire effect of the arbitration award to be repealed bit by bit by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.049" offset="8271600">Certainly, I don't think anyone could contend that certain states would have the power to pass legislation here of a nature of this full-crew laws or that there was some sort of grandfather clause for the existing full-crew laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.888" offset="8338892">If there was no supersession here, then anyone of the 50 states could've moved into this area and regardless of what the award said, that state could've taken its bite out of the award, could've kept the fireman, could've kept the level of crew manning in the train service that the -- had prevailed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.723" offset="8438262">The states could've eaten up the award bit by bit and if you look into the way in which these laws get enacted, in effect, these laws are substitute for the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.846" offset="8490715">They amount to the efforts of the Brotherhoods on the one side and the carriers on the other when they come to in impasse to try to solve it through legislation one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.775" offset="8550484">And if the national award is vulnerable to being eaten up bit by bit by bit, I think we've got a very strange situation for an act of Congress to intend that and I would suggest respectfully that it would -- it should take the explicit language of the statute before we should come to that conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.995" offset="9683362">And secondly, because of the emergency or temporary as it's called, the character of the Federal Act that there should also for that reason be held not to be supersession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.267" offset="9744488">I should like to talk to those two points in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.228" offset="9764237">First, as to the safety point, whatever one may think of the relationship of these statutes to safety that may have been their justification in 1907 to what extent they are now justified by that is an issue that remains to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.850" offset="9842813">The one thing about them that is indisputable is that they are entirely different from the usual sort of railroad safety statute that we think about, they are not like the Federal Safety Appliance Act or like the rule about cabooses that the Court had before it in the Terminal Railroad case back in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.066" offset="9931630">They are not like the usual sort of industrial health and safety regulation about protective clothing or about sanitary facilities or about drinking water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.054" offset="9979591">What they do is that they go -- these laws go directly to the two central points in the labor management economic situation and I understand those two points to be jobs and money and these laws go direct jobs to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.955" offset="10055241">To be true, they might have a further safety aspect but the central fact about them is that they directly regulate the principle labor management economic problem in this industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.959" offset="12559235">I don't think that would've been a complete and final disposition of the issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.501" offset="12613360">The way in which you can -- one can put those two commands of Congress together is to hold that the award stands in effect as an award for the two-year period that thereafter the parties are free to engage in collective bargaining and can -- or certainly intended that they engaged in collective bargaining and try and settle this among themselves in the future as to what would be the situation thereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.817" offset="13002689">And it also said we will have this solution which will cut down and they foresaw that it would cut down the over manning that would reduce the fireman and reduce the trainmen and either would cut down part of the problem will be over manning that the railroads were concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.639" offset="13069876">And that thereafter, what the level of manning that you're going to have after that was up to the parties but of course they had to do it under the terms of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.531" offset="13117524">A lot of the suggestions to the contrary that this was an emergency or temporary legislation that the ordinary rules of supersession shouldn't apply to those circumstances, I think it would've been better taken if what Congress had done here would've -- was to have impose the moratorium, Congress didn't imposed a moratorium here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.732" offset="13206340">Congress didn't say to the unions simply, “Thou shalt not strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.118" offset="13215848">Congress didn't say simply to the carriers, “Thou shalt not put into effect these rules doing a way of a fireman.” Congress said, “We will provide not only a moratorium that will call off a strike but we will provide a machinery whereby there would be a solution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.523" offset="13317413">If Congress itself had provided that 90% of the fireman's jobs were to be eliminated and that the consist on the trainman was to be a conductor and two train men, there would be no gain saying of the fact that the state law as to the contrary couldn't stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.416" offset="13401004">We contend that when Congress provided not only for a procedural stay of the strike and of the carriers self-help but also for a solution to be reached through an arbitration board that had also provided in that forum for a substantive solution to this controversy and that the substantive solution that Congress provided for was not one that the states were to be permitted to take a bite out of here and a bite out of there through these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.754" offset="13546350">The ordinary rule is that Congress intends its acts to be of nationwide application.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.623" offset="14013837">I would like to take our remaining time primarily by attempting to fill out the answers on the legislative history given by distinguished counsel for the appellees to the question from the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.642" offset="14073919">First, as to the last or one of the last problems that was raised in their argument about the two-year expiration of award and about the conditions going on from then, I submit that by and large, this is not a problem that is raised in this case to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.481" offset="14149256">I submit as the amicus briefs frankly say and boldly say to the National Railway Labor Conference for example, and what they'd like to have is a ruling from this Court on the Arkansas full-crew law which they could then use to go and stop a strike and require a whole series of new notices when the awards expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.563" offset="14237654">That is a practical effect of this point as I believe the railroads are raising it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.825" offset="14262627">Now, Congress as they point out in their brief is right now considering the effects of Public Law 88-108 and the affects of the arbitration award, Congress is considering that after request to the railroads to extend that award for another two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.417" offset="14333053">Some of these legislative proceedings are quoted in the briefs -- in this brief of the railroad appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.006" offset="14367431">This is a problem which is a difficult one for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.676" offset="14382059">And I -- but I submit that it is not a problem as a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.952" offset="14403166">It is a matter of difficult decisions between competing interests which is not appropriate to a decision on preemption of state full-crew laws in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.440" offset="14449142">In (Inaudible) -- response to Mr. Justice Brennan's statement about we are asking for and legislative history compelled or suggests a bizarre result, I think this is true, it's a bizarre situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3605.044" offset="14523538">Congress knew it was a bizarre situation and was so reluctant and repeatedly said that, “If there's only some way we could do something about this the party we only agree and then they would've became apparent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3923.338" offset="15796746">Mr. Shane said, “I think this is what the railroads want because they know about Section 511 to which Mr. Ginnane had already pointed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3979.102" offset="16019832">And presumably in response to what the Brotherhoods were accusing the railroad of wanting to throw these men off in the street and that was the phrase the railroads used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.355" offset="16052746">We are not (Inaudible) off the street and the overwriting purpose of Congress in this was a desire to limit its action as much as possible in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.237" offset="16108335">It relates to the test of pervasiveness which this Court has applied in evaluating preemption contentions but certainly, it didn't want to do anymore than it absolutely had to do to stop the strike and so the railroad said, “Well, don't worry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.899" offset="16159013">You aren't doing too much here because there are 17,000 people protected by state full-crew laws.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4038.039" offset="16255561">Mr. Smith said, “In the matter of purely intrastate commerce under our constitution, the state of course would have authority but when it comes to dealing with interstate commerce I think the provisions of the constitution are such that there is no way in which a state can overcome the power of the Federal Government under the interstate commerce clause.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4066.748" offset="16370395">This is quoted in the appendix to my brief which had the legislative history which is on page 73 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.433" offset="16421073">He was talking about a constitutional theory which I submit is completely inconsistent with the Norwood decision as to full-crew laws where this Court said the state can in the matter of a certain kind affect interstate commerce not to speak of a long line of decisions since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.903" offset="16490977">As to what (Inaudible) what Mr. Ginnane said in his further answer to Mr. Justice White's question of yesterday, the railroads are expanding and Mr. Ginnane's statement into a statement that if you want to be sure you want a preempting you got to go ahead and put in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.179" offset="16568090">Now, that's not what Mr. Ginnane said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.663" offset="16578017">Mr. Ginnane was talking about a specific provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, a matter which is actually academic and moot in view of the fact that both Houses took the Interstate Commerce Act reference out of the resolution all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.572" offset="16633710">But secondly, let's assume that Mr. Ginnane's -- should've -- just should've brought to mind to the Congress the idea that they should do something specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.508" offset="16673416">Much more often than Mr. Ginnane statements were quoted to Congress, the decision of this Court in Norwood and the particular statement of this Court in Norwood that unless and until Congress expressly said to the contrary state full-crew laws remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.041" offset="16743528">I submit that Congress was entitled to rely on this statement in reference to what have to put in the legislation and I submit that this was said by Mr. Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.068" offset="16783653">It was repeatedly --repeated by railroad spokesman who quoted Mr. Wirtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.716" offset="16806222">It was said by Oren Harris on the floor of the House of Representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.292" offset="16824508">This Court's Norwood statement, again, I don't say of course that it's binding in any sense but it certainly is persuasive evidence that Congress had the right to rely on things, nothing in the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.714" offset="16878216">It is the contextual factor in relation to what is actually there that is overwhelming in denial of the whole preemption point it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.255" offset="16916355">The court below ruled and said, “We are impressed the Court said where the need for an orderly system of transportation."</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.692" offset="16942164">The railroads in the amicus frankly say, “Let's sweep this whole thing clean in this case and just have a whole series of rules.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.712" offset="16974242">We submit that this is beyond function in this case, Your Honor.</text>
