            <text syncTime="672.987" offset="2795290">Whether it's a junk case.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.107" offset="2803754">That being so, then we must measure or not whether or not there was sufficient overall need by the legislature of the State of Arizona to enter into this relatively tender area of limitation of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.278" offset="2860492">And in that case -- in this case, there's no showing of the State of Arizona that there was any such need.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.591" offset="2881703">Secondly, one of the things that this Court has been careful in the past is to see that -- assuming that a state does have a need and wishes to fulfill that need, whether or not they have used a tool, chosen the proper tool to ex -- to fulfill their need.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.863" offset="2958817">The question is whether assuming that they thought that they had a problem dealing with subversion, whether or not the tool that they've chosen is the one least disruptive of the rights of freedom of association and freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.846" offset="3010748">And in that regard, the history of -- an examination of the authorities in dealing with the adoption of loyalty oaths, say in California, as set forth in the citations and authorities of review that we've given in our brief on both occasions that we've been to this Court would indicate that the adoption of the technique of disclaimer by so-called loyalty oath with provision similar to Section (e) have been a failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.885" offset="3134882">In the State of Arizona, there hasn't been one prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.605" offset="3145749">There hasn't -- one person turned up as a subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.072" offset="3159646">The evil of it must be also considered in terms of its adverse effect upon the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.330" offset="3184724">And certainly, I think we've cited within our brief the situation, a study done under the auspices of the Twentieth Century Fund on the effect of these disclaimer oaths, on these loyalty oaths, such as Section (e) of Arizona law and the academic community, in which they were rather disastrous in terms of their attitude and feeling of freedom and their ability to speak out and undertake lines of development.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.828" offset="3290676">So, the evidence that's before this Court in terms of this type of legislation is one that in the State of Arizona show no fundamental need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.108" offset="3323800">And, secondly, it's adopted a piece of legislation which has demonstrated in its effect over the country, danger and an injury to the academic community.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.949" offset="3367163">But assuming for a minute that the legislation on those basis is perfectly constitutional, I think there are certain other aspects that one might consider with this legislation to -- that indicates it's uncons -- that's not constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.755" offset="3438425">What it -- assuming that the State of Arizona has a problem with subversion and a finding out in attempting to get rid of employees of the cities, counties, dogcatchers, garbage collectors, etcetera for being subversive, may that society -- may that legislature throw the burden of dealing with a problem from its own shoulders onto the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.580" offset="3545736">I think that's exactly what the State of Arizona has attempted to do in two fundamental ways, one, by denying of hearing and the question of procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.764" offset="3590457">The second aspect is by framing a piece of legislation that is so vague that the man of ordinary understanding cannot be properly advised of what conduct will allow him to act in safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.026" offset="3655450">What the State of Arizona does by presenting Section (e) to any employee is to shift the burden, instead of going through an administrative proceedings, with hearings, with accusations, with accusers, with transcripts, the individual must meet the issue all by himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.281" offset="3748446">Now, the question comes, and I don't think we need too much discussion on the fact that though an employee doesn't have a right to a government job, that the government in dealing with the employee must afford him basic due process in terms of -- with firing and hiring procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.980" offset="3819290">I think we've set that forth in a number of different cases before this Court in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.566" offset="3845622">But taking the situation of a right of hearing, what is the individual faced with?</text>
            <text syncTime="944.936" offset="3883133">In this case, if he wants to continue to work for income, he wants to continue to receive his salary, he must sign the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.869" offset="3926810">If he doesn't, he doesn't get a salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.867" offset="3938826">On the other case, if he wants employment, he must sign the oath or he may not be employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.640" offset="3965889">This is a -- fundamentally a denial of procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.491" offset="3993370">The quality of placing a burden upon the individual to decide all of the terms of this legislation, when we come to the vagueness question itself, but notice the burden that it puts upon the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.624" offset="4053870">One, at his penalty, he must determine all of the terms of this particular subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.132" offset="4075917">He must determine what knowing is and what advocacy is, and aid is, and what an association that has as one of its purposes the overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.077" offset="4131715">All of this burden is put on the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.165" offset="4140074">He stands there by himself, in secret, without any aid, without any really effective aid of counsel, unless he hires himself, all the burden of judging his own conduct and of interpreting the meaning of the statute is thrown upon his shoulders, what to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.327" offset="4228681">So the State of Arizona might find out if he is a subversive, might.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.230" offset="4248325">Is there enough validity to the --of placing the individual with this type of burden to gain benefit to the State of Arizona in terms of attempting to find out or discriminate or get rid of a subversive, highly doubtful on the basis of the history of this particular legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.294" offset="4336515">The -- this Court, in the second Nostrand versus Little case, noted that the -- in the second state decision, after the remand by this Court, noted that their oath was prospective only and it held that where tenure was involved on the University Professors of that State, that there would have to be a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.202" offset="4468172">The Court there, I think, erroneously determined in the State of Wisconsin that there was no right to public employment and therefore no right of hearing on any other employee other than those that have been specifically granted tenure by their reason of being a university professor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.587" offset="4541733">But the -- but this Court in Nostrand versus Little, and the state court recognized in Nostrand versus Little the essential necessity of a hearing to grant a person the right to explain why or why not they're not accepting or taking the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.245" offset="4620309">The distinction between a criminal prosecution and the placing of the burden directly upon the individual by confronting him with his decision is that in terms of a criminal prosecution, one, all of the procedure of the state would be that a trained county attorney, or district attorney, prosecuting officer would have to evaluate with his legal training and experience and knowledge the exact meaning of the statute as applied to an individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.816" offset="4730650">They have to have a proper and preliminary investigation of the purported facts of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.838" offset="4750712">There'd have to be a conclusion by the prosecution with understanding of the probabilities of success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.756" offset="4770356">There would have to be a preliminary judicial scrutiny of the case in terms of an issuance of a warrant for arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.043" offset="4795538">There would then be in nearly every state procedure and certainly in the State of Arizona a preliminary hearing or a grand jury scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.254" offset="4828348">All of this scrutiny before society would effectively act upon the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.580" offset="4857710">By presenting him with an oath and forcing him to sign it at the danger of losing his job or danger of losing his salary, the state short circuits all of the social security of the individual that we have worked out in criminal prosecution and place the whole burden on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.940" offset="4967111">The issue of giving a man an opportunity to explain his position is fundamental in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.698" offset="4994173">It's a fundamental aspect of due process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.628" offset="5013922">The opportunity to say where you stand and why you stand before one loses valuable rights is the basic concept of due process, as established by this Court, certainly in Lerner versus Casey and a number of other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1433.553" offset="5837615">The lower court felt that on the same basis, that a man must have the right to publicly say why he is not signing such an oath and the reasons why he is not signing it so that the public may know, so that he may not go about branded in our society without a forum, without a record of his opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.381" offset="5936880">And I think that in substance, that when one considers the grave consequences to an individual as to whether or not he signed this oath containing subsection (e) and his inability to create a public forum for his position, except by appeal to this Court, as suggested in the reply brief or answering brief of the state is to place an undue burden upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.349" offset="6044818">There are certain questions, questions of whether or not -- if in subsequent prosecution under the anti-subversive law, whether or not the failure of the individual who signed this oath may not be used against him in a future criminal prosecution or at least in cross-examination to show that, at that time he had a bad knowledge of his association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.195" offset="6132172">There's a question of whether or not in fact, this is not in effect self-incrimination because his very failure to take the oath labels him in the community as either of two things, one, a dangerous person by subversive association or, two, that maybe just as dangerous in our society as an unstable person, as a person who may be reckless in their affiliations or reckless in their thoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.213" offset="6256201">In either one, the black morale of our (Inaudible) -- of esteem that was upon the individual, he carries it wherever he goes into every other form of employment, particularly this school teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.770" offset="6294444">And he leaves the school district because he hasn't signed the oath and attempts to get a job any other place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.399" offset="7200998">We have many definitions of the word “knowing”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.541" offset="7221582">This is not just as clear a word as one would have it sometimes meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.748" offset="7254392">The -- in the -- in United States versus Bianco, cited in our brief, the term “knowingly” contains no element of evil purpose but purports -- imports a perception of facts requisite to make up a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.143" offset="7327953">In U.S. versus Martinez, cited in our brief, where there's a clue on it that the defendant knew what he was about to do and with such knowledge proceed to do the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.415" offset="7369017">It means that in Rubenstein, U.S. versus Rubenstein, “knowingly false” means that the party honestly did not believe it to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.858" offset="7398797">You have even in your Iberville Land co. versus Amerada Petroleum, knowledge of notice sufficient to excite action and put a person on his God and call for inquiry could be sufficient knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.014" offset="7455431">So, it's not the simple nice knowledge in toto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.283" offset="7468492">It's a knowledge that may be imputed by his conduct and to -- left to the tender mercies of a jury to decide what his basic knowledge was and his basic intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.739" offset="7510288">It's not sufficient to give the individual security from how his conduct will be in the future interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.784" offset="7538500">And this is the problem of the knowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.526" offset="7545501">Secondly, when we get into the area of vagueness of the Arizona statute, it's very interesting that the Arizona Supreme Court had to redefine -- in its first decision had to redefine the meaning of advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.016" offset="7595447">Then we go back, after the Baggett versus Bullitt, the Arizona Supreme Court had to redefine the word “aid” in light of Baggett versus Bullitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.560" offset="7637661">On its question of vagueness, Judge Bernstein, in the second opinion, he was told that there were open questions of vagueness, the question of what the statute means as to membership in an organization which has as one of its purposes the forcible overthrow of the government and how much knowledge is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.394" offset="7712998">There's no definition within the statute or in the determinations of it of how much knowledge an individual has to have of the unlawful purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.031" offset="7759496">And, in your Baggett versus Bullitt, and Cramp versus Florida, the standard which you placed in connection with statutes of this type is that the terms of the statute must be susceptible of objective measurement, and there is no objective measurements of the term “had knowledge of”, how much knowledge?</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.336" offset="7848730">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.881" offset="7854895">The individual is put on a burden of defining a lot of terms which apparently the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona has had difficulty with in a number of different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.236" offset="7896273">If the statute was so clear, it seems rather strange that our Supreme Court had to redefine its terms twice and yet, this is the burden that's put upon the individual and still hasn't decided what some of the terms mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.501" offset="7949354">And, secondly, and I think as pointed out by Justice Black in his dissent in the Scales case, one of the dangerous things of such legislation is this, is the great amount of judicial operation on the statute of adding new meanings so that in the State of Arizona now aid those no longer mean aid and advocacy does no longer mean advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.387" offset="8072965">It means something different from what it said originally in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.341" offset="8088743">The danger of rewriting this legislation by judicial interpretation to -- in an attempt to make -- come up to constitutional standards is that, one, the individual has no right to rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.530" offset="8137540">If the Court changes its mind five years from now or two years from now, the defendant has no constitutional right that's involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.664" offset="8174007">Ex post facto provisions of the constitution don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.522" offset="8189471">Stare decisis is not a binding upon the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.382" offset="8208906">All these interpretations may be allowed to be changed and the defendant would have no relief on a charge of perjury in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.638" offset="8241925">The State of Arizona is as confused as it apparently is in terms of the meaning of its own statute, notwithstanding that the -- that this Court had already determined some of the terms of advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.626" offset="8305873">It seems to be an undue burden to put upon the laymen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.357" offset="8320815">And if you wish to understand the attitude of the State Supreme Court and what the individual is against in the State of Arizona in terms of its own Court and its interpretation, I wish to read to you part of the first decision of our Court written by the same Chief Justice who is now presently Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.577" offset="8393644">He said in the first decision on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.467" offset="8409213">The breadth and intolerance that -- intolerance of the Arizona Su -- well, let me state it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.438" offset="8429171">The state's interest demands that public employees refrain from associations out of which even unconscious corruption may comfort those who seek world domination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.280" offset="8484446">It goes on to second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.040" offset="8487581">“The risk that the insidious poison may be spread is not one the people of the state are willing to accept.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.712" offset="8518196">When one's own Supreme Court talks about associations out of which even unconscious corruption may arise and then, we are asked to sign an oath with provisions as vague as past membership in terms of subsidiary organizations, in terms of organizations that have as one of their purposes the forcible overthrow, this statute, I think, fails on vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.013" offset="8651421">One other aspect of the case, I think, very much linked to the same problem is the question of whether or not this type of legislation is in effect a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.226" offset="8708263">I know that the history of bills of attainder concept with this Court, as with the doctrine of mens rea have not receive a great deal of consideration in recent times but there at appears to be at least a growing interest on the part of this Court with the attendant concepts of self-incrimination and bills of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.664" offset="8794049">It seems rather obvious in this matter that when an individual is put to the position without a hearing of having to sign an oath or not sign this type of affirmation, that if for any reason, he feels duty bound not to sign it, on the basis he's guilty, because that would make an assumption, wouldn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.430" offset="8881089">We -- we'd be doing the same thing which happens when people take the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.975" offset="8899271">We'd be making the assumption that they were guilty and that assumption we may not legally take, but it's the assumption that's taken in our society because our very reaction bespeaks of the reaction in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.337" offset="8940753">The minute he doesn't take it, he's proscribed, he's immediately denoted in our society, and this is by legislative quiet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.054" offset="8999581">There's no adjudicatory process and one of the failures of the bill of attainder -- one of the reasons for the bills of attainder is the prohibition against this lack of adjudicatory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.167" offset="9043989">In essence, it's very similar to the concept of procedural due process or the denial of procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.970" offset="9071261">The bills of attainder might be forward on that concept and the same sort of concept is a denial of procedural due process because of the historical relationship of denying an adjudicatory process to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.397" offset="9112952">And, in this sense, Mrs. Elfbrandt and all the other employees of the State of Arizona put into an ambivalent position where either you sign or you don't sign, and if you don't sign, you are considered by our society to be guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.836" offset="9170735">On this basis -- on the basis of the previous decisions in this State, in this Court, construction of the constitution, we therefore feel that the statute is unconstitutional as being unconstitutionally vague and for denial of procedural due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2300.205" offset="9304168">There are three things which are prohibited which are made crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.495" offset="9321305">One is the act of overthrowing the government by force or violence or aiding in the commission of an act to overthrow state government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.967" offset="9359235">I think it is admitted but certainly not attacked that this is a valid piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.386" offset="9384939">The second prohibition is against advocating the overthrow of government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.749" offset="9410330">The statute is limited to the word “advocate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.628" offset="9425899">The third prohibition is becoming or remaining a member of the Communist Party or any other organization, knowing that it has for one of its purposes, the overthrow of the government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.877" offset="9474905">These prohibitions apply to all citizens of the State of Arizona generally and specifically to all public employees by reason of two different statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.152" offset="9519940">The statute relative to public employees has been attacked, first of all, on the basis that provides for no administrative due process that a person may lose his possession without having a chance to explain at the administrative and procedural level his reasons why he does not wish to take an oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.825" offset="9594650">I think it is simply and best put in the dissent in Nostrand versus Little by Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3687.781" offset="14854457">In the Washington case, Baggett versus Bullitt, which this Court apparently was interested in its remand order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3772.755" offset="15194363">This Court compared it to the older Act sustained in the American Communications Association versus Douds where there was no fiver year prior period mentioned and stated that the intention was to forestall future dangerous conduct and that there was no one who by a voluntary alteration of the loyalties which impel him to action can become eligible to sign the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.665" offset="15290075">We cannot conclude that this action is a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.632" offset="15301883">We have the same thing in Arizona.No past conduct is commented on in any way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3814.232" offset="15360293">As I said before, I think there is certainly no court or public opinion.</text>
