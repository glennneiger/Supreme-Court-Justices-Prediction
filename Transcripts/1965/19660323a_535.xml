            <text syncTime="54.020" offset="319404">In the three minutes I have left, I would like to make two brief points prompted by a question asked yesterday by Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.245" offset="356394">First point, in 1952 the Secretary of the Treasury stated that the way the Commissioner was administering Regulation 162-12 by requiring an accrual method farmer to capitalize the cost of raising his breeding animals and permitting a cash method farmer to expense the same item “discriminated heavily” against the accrual method farmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.203" offset="488155">The petitioner is now as in this Court to sanction and approve that discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.103" offset="519816">And to strike from the books a 45-year old regulation which states categorically that raising costs of breeding animals constitutes an expense and therefore cannot be capitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.561" offset="585644">My second point, the petitioner argues that by electing the accrual method of accounting, a farmer binds himself to capitalize the cost of raising his breeding animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.015" offset="643427">This is simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.179" offset="656071">It is fundamental in tax law and tax accounting that a person does not by adopting the accrual method of accounting or any other method elect or agree to capitalize any item of his ordinary and necessary business expenses such as the cost of raising his breeding animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.935" offset="747081">It is only when he decides to put his breeders into inventory that the mechanics of the inventory method of accounting picks up these expenses and capitalizes them.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.567" offset="797654">It is true that the farmers in the Wardlaw case did elect to put their breeders in inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.440" offset="829106">But they did so years ago, some as far back as 1913 long before such inclusion had any significance tax wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.448" offset="873200">And when it did become significant tax wise, the Commissioner ruled under Regulation 471 that they could not take their breeders out.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.035" offset="919489">When the Lewis case came along it overruled the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.656" offset="934013">The respondents in the Wardlaw case promptly filed a claim for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.953" offset="955225">I thank the Court.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Gordon G. Hawn</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="217.004" stopTime="222.673">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="217.004" offset="971421">Mr. Hawn.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_g_hawn" startTime="222.673" stopTime="302.339">
            <label>Mr. Gordon G. Hawn</label>
            <text syncTime="222.673" offset="994095">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.921" offset="1011022">This case involves a question of discrimination and that is the Commissioner's discrimination against these accrual basis ranch payers who use the unit-livestock-price method to value their inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.527" offset="1065462">Now, the problem in this case and a great danger is that we get so involved in these Treasury Regulations, the statutes, these Treasury decisions that we will lose sight on the fundamental issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.113" offset="1119796">Now, that issue, what is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="256.728" offset="1130245">We submit the issue is, can the Commissioner by Regulation deny these taxpayers the full benefits of a statute which was intended as a relief measure applicable alike to all taxpayers?</text>
            <text syncTime="269.329" offset="1180714">Now, the statute clearly says that livestock -- breeding livestock are properly used in trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.277" offset="1212479">The statute also says that it if it's property used in trade or business, it's not properly includable in the inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.437" offset="1241109">The Regulation however, 1.471-6 (f) requires the taxpayers to include this livestock in the inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.430" offset="1277053">Now the question is, does the Regulation contravene the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.042" offset="1295548">Now historically, the Commissioner's continually attempted to defeat --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="302.339" offset="1312684">Well, not only it requires you to include it but to take it out again, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_g_hawn" startTime="306.463" stopTime="308.289">
            <label>Mr. Gordon G. Hawn</label>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="308.289" offset="1336508">Which is different from any other inventory items?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_g_hawn" startTime="311.373" stopTime="592.847">
            <label>Mr. Gordon G. Hawn</label>
            <text syncTime="311.373" offset="1348838">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.652" offset="1353958">To my knowledge it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.876" offset="1362840">Historically the Commissioner has attempted to deny the benefits of the statute to the livestock industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.797" offset="1386559">The statute was originally passed in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.966" offset="1403277">It authorized capital gains on property used in trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.553" offset="1417592">Now livestock weren't specifically mentioned.But since they had all the characteristics of property used in the trade or business, when the farmer or rancher began to sell them, they claim capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.290" offset="1464508">Now the first case, the Albright case was decided in March of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.684" offset="1486137">In that case, the Commissioner attempts to deny it to the cash-basis taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.337" offset="1504737">The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected that.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.438" offset="1517171">Then, the tax court followed within the Fawn Lake case where the Commissioner attempted to deny it to the accrual-basis taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.108" offset="1547786">Finally, in the Bennett case decided in June of 1951, the Commissioner in that case was ordering that all livestock are held primarily for sale, they never can qualify for capital gain treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.440" offset="1601181">The Fifth Circuit rejected the Commissioner's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.681" offset="1614137">Thereafter, the Commissioner issued a Mimeograph 6660, and he said he would follow Albright and Bennett.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.157" offset="1647992">But for the first time he says that he is going to deny the benefits of the section to young animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.826" offset="1674637">Well, at this point Congress had to intervene, they amended the statute, they said it specifically to define, to draft dairy and breeding livestock regardless of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.332" offset="1720717">Yet in -- subsequently, in 1954, we find the Commissioner in the McDonald case trying to impose new standards of age and reproductivity on young animals and this was rejected by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.718" offset="1790203">Now, as counsel for the respondent in the Wardlaw case as pointed out, the Commissioner has continually shifted his position in this case and in all of this historical development.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.406" offset="1849031">According to the Government's theory now the Regulation had apparently changed from the time it was -- that the case was in the Court of Appeals until when it reached the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.481" offset="1889259">And the Court of Appeals -- the Regulation required the inclusion of all these raise breeding animals in the inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.229" offset="1912247">But in brief, in oral argument before this Court, the Government says, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.784" offset="1930533">All that's required is the taxpayer has to accumulate the cost of raising animals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="462.222" offset="1952266">This is the Government's ultimate position.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.297" offset="1960521">I submit that it must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.121" offset="1967835">As Mr. Gregory has pointed out, then Regulation 471-6 (f) conflicts with Regulation 162-12 which was promulgated back in the early 20's.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.596" offset="2021752">And through this document statutory enactment has achieved the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.382" offset="2044949">Now, I submit though that the Regulation thus require the inclusions of breeding animals in the inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.330" offset="2068668">In the first place, the Government stipulated in this case in the trial court that the taxpayers were required to include these animals in the inventory in accordance with this Treasury Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.840" offset="2114748">Now if the taxpayers were required to do this they didn't do it voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.884" offset="2138885">Also, every Court of Appeals that has considered the question, Lewis, Ekberg, Catto and Wardlaw has concluded that the Regulation makes this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.667" offset="2190085">Now, to really understand the problem involved it's necessary to consider fundamentals of federal income taxation of ranchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.671" offset="2226030">Now, we must distinguish I think between fundamentals of income taxation and general principles of accounting, that these are not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.909" offset="2266990">For example, taxpayer in the oil and gas business is permitted by election to expense or capitalize intangible drilling cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.076" offset="2303666">Clearly, from an accounting standpoint these are capital expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.926" offset="2323101">They are costs of acquiring an asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.698" offset="2338147">But for income tax purposes, the taxpayer had his election, can treat them as an expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.630" offset="2369912">Now, suppose the Commissioner would now pass a Regulation and say that accrual-basis oil and gas operators are required to include all wells in the inventory, in other words the Section 1231 asset, property used in the trade or business in the inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.585" offset="2441697">Now, I don't believe this Court would have any difficulty reaching their conclusion that that Regulation is invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.884" offset="2634898">It says all farmers can deduct the cost of raising their animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.522" offset="2657468">Now briefly, let us consider the cash-basis taxpayer and the accrual-basis taxpayer insofar as the ranchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.601" offset="2685785">Now cash-basis taxpayer, he reports his income as he receives it and he deducts his expenses as he pays them.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.373" offset="2712848">Now he is permitted to deduct the cost of raising his livestock.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.261" offset="2740433">He is not required to include in his ordinary income the value of his livestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.525" offset="2757465">And when he sells his 1231 assets, breeding livestock, he gets capital gains on the entire sales price.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.487" offset="3937364">But as a result to the enactment of 117 (j) in 1942 all that was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.278" offset="3964531">And at the outset, the benefits of this action were either limited or denied in full to the livestock industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.578" offset="3993684">And even after the Albright case and the Bennett decision since 1949 to 1951 was necessary for Congress to amend Section 117 (j) making it specifically applicable to the livestock industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.300" offset="4048541">Now in the meantime, the Commissioner in 1944 had issued this unit-livestock-price method Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.665" offset="4082082">And through this process he commenced -- discriminated against the accrual-basis taxpayers by requiring them to include their raised breeding animals in the inventory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.201" offset="4212172">And the discriminatory effect of the Regulation was first brought to the attention of the Courts in the Lewis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.448" offset="4233174">And the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit there held that the Regulation was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.326" offset="4252714">The Court there concluded that under the 1951 amendment to Section 117 (j) the taxpayers were not required to include the raised breeding animals in the inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.195" offset="4292106">And that's the Treasury Regulation which compelled the taxpayer to include breeding animals in the inventory contravened the statute and was therefore invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.936" offset="4331081">Undaunted, the Commission had succeeded in the Ekberg case and in drafting onto the Lewis case the doctrine of knowledgeable choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.516" offset="4365458">Now under the theory of the Ekberg case, if the taxpayer elect to the accrual basis after the issuance of this I.T. in 1945, he was bound by the advantages and disadvantages under the accrual method.</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.603" offset="4445811">The difficulty for the Government however is that a knowledgeable choice presupposes a full knowledge of all material facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.659" offset="4477994">Now the Catto's had the choice -- their choice to elect the cash or accrual method of accounting and select the method of evaluating the inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.953" offset="4507146">When they commenced their ranching operations in 1938, that time a rancher could not get capital gains on breeding livestock under any circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.954" offset="4947153">But you've never asked for permission to change?</text>

          <turn speaker="gordon_g_hawn" startTime="1216.024" stopTime="1532.897">
            <label>Mr. Gordon G. Hawn</label>
            <text syncTime="1216.024" offset="4967424">No sir, we have never submitted an application because it would have been a useless thing because they wouldn't even -- to have considered it for a period of approximately 10 or 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.802" offset="5062614">As a practical matter, the law did not become clear until the law -- until the statute was codified and (Inaudible) -- and cast in unequivocable terms in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.885" offset="5110888">Now, even though at that time Albright had been decided in 1949 the Commissioner did not accept this as the law as he continued to litigate the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.982" offset="5151326">As late as 1951 in the Bennett case, he was still contending that all livestock were held primarily for sale as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.575" offset="5181628">And that no rancher was entitled to capital gains on any of the proceeds of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.818" offset="5202631">Now, the Government in its reply brief and in the oral argument raised the point that a taxpayer can't revoke an election merely because there's been a change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.968" offset="5247248">And they cite this Court's decision in Wilshire Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.566" offset="5261667">Now I submit that that case is distinguishable on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.318" offset="5276609">One, the statute there was not a relief statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.511" offset="5289462">It was merely a statute dealing with the computation of depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.230" offset="5308270">Two, after the statute was passed in that case the Commissioner by regulation afforded taxpayers a new option, six months period in which to make a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.065" offset="5355604">In that case, the taxpayer did not exercise that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.304" offset="5372635">We in this case have never been afforded an option to make any such election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.397" offset="5396982">But the Government argues here that the doctrine of statutory reenactment applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.800" offset="5418611">They go on to say that Congress was aware of the situation, discrimination between the cash and accrual-basis taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.481" offset="5453302">And in any event the -- that they were prevented from changing the regulation because the Secretary of Treasury wrote a letter to the Senate Finance Committee chairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.941" offset="5499173">Since the code was reenacted, the provision was reenacted in the 1954 Code verbatim that it's been frozen in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.879" offset="5530937">My first answer to that in which I -- I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit, is not included in the brief because I just quite overlooked it until this weekend, is the letter itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.487" offset="5585272">The letter is dated June 27, 1952 and it says and I quote, “My Dear Senator, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has called to my attention the tax situation which deserves serious legislative consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.701" offset="5646190">The problem is of such importance that I feel it should promptly be brought to the attention of congressional committees concerned with taxation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.636" offset="5673880">In 1952, in June of 1952, the Secretary of Treasury first learned about the problem and at that time he said he thought it ought to be brought to the Committee's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.284" offset="5724557">There are several other reasons the doctrine doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.748" offset="5738350">One is that there's not a line from any congressional hearing, any committee report, or any floor debate, to show that Congress was ever aware of the situation much less that it intended to improve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.522" offset="5789445">Finally, the Government argues that the removal of these animals from the inventory constitutes the change of accounting method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.855" offset="5822777">And since that the Commissioner's position was not obtained, the removal was illegal, and our cause of action must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.133" offset="5855901">Our reply here is again two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.435" offset="5865096">In the first place, no change of accounting method is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.950" offset="5879202">The animals were erroneously included in the inventory in compliance with the invalid regulation and in violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.806" offset="5906578">Therefore, the taxpayers are simply corrected and they're caused by an invalid regulation and in complying with the expressed terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.448" offset="5937194">Hence, no change of accounting method is involved and the taxpayers were not required to obtain the Commissioner's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.172" offset="5968018">But even if we assume that it -- the change of accounting method is involved, the Commissioner's consent would not be required here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.833" offset="5994663">As I pointed out, it was stipulated in this case that the Commissioner would have refused to consider and as a consequence to act upon an application during the years in question and this is precisely the same situation which existed during the years involved in the Lewis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.939" offset="6055163">Now, conceding the statute gives the Commission the power to pass on application for change of accounting method, and conceded also that the Commission is vested with the discretion to refuse these applications, we submit however that the Commission is not vested with the power or authority to arbitrarily refuse to even consider application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.397" offset="6133008">In our brief, there are several opinions by this Court that stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.053" offset="6151607">We submit that the proposition that a public official vested with discretionary power must exercise that discretion and may not arbitrarily determine the issues without even considering the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.312" offset="6196642">I'm specifically referring to United States v. Shaughnessy, a decision by Justice Clark in Yellin versus United States was -- the decision was by Chief Justice Warren.</text>
