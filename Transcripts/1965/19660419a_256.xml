            <label>Mr. Jerome M. Feit</label>
            <text syncTime="22.245" offset="192345">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.228" offset="204257">At the outset, I would request the Court's permission for Mr. Thomas H. Peebles of the Tennessee Bar to argue this case for appellee's pro hac vice.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.369" offset="256815">This case is here on direct appeal from an order of the District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee dismissing an indictment on the ground that it failed to charge an offense under the statute upon which it was based, 18 U.S.C. 660.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.811" offset="326614">The indictment which is set out at page 1 of the record charged that while riding on his employer's truck moving in interstate commerce, appellee embezzled funds belonging to his employer who was an individual engaged in commerce as a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.374" offset="408848">18 U.S.C. 660 proscribed such embezzlement when committed by an employee of any firm, association, or corporation engaged in commerce as a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.932" offset="475094">The District Court read the statutory language firm, association, corporation as excluding from the statute's coverage individually owned carriers and accordingly dismissed the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.698" offset="530160">In so doing, it followed the lead of the Tenth Circuit which in 1950, in a per curiam decision earlier reached the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.573" offset="573628">It is the Government's position that the District Court has given the statute an unnecessarily circumscribed reading contrary to the underlying legislative purpose and not commanded by the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.154" offset="639979">As we will show the statute in general and the employee provision in particular, protects all common carriers engaged in the business of interstate carrier, irrespective of their size, and no matter the internal business structure in which the carrier chooses to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.265" offset="724407">I would first like to turn to an examination of this legislative purpose and then to the question of whether the actual language employed in the statute can reasonably be read and fairly understood as convened to this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.993" offset="791385">18 U.S.C. 660 is an amalgam of two distinct provisions of a Criminal Code brought together by the 1948 revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.704" offset="834226">One, dealing with embezzlement by executives of carriers which had been previously Section 412 of the 1946 Code, and the other with certain kinds of employee embezzlement which had been Section 409 of the 1946 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.368" offset="920848">The employee part under which appellee was here indicted was first adopted in 1946, only two years before the 1948 revision as one of the series of broadening amendments of the Carlin Act of 1913 which had its aim, the protection of -- from theft of property entrusted to carriers for interstate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.884" offset="1030875">The 1946 amendment to Section 409, streamlined statutes by setting it up in separate provisions, broadened it to cover air as well as surface transportation and embezzlement as well as larceny and in addition, added Section 409 (a) (5) which is set out at page 9 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.555" offset="1129618">In essence, this Section provided that an employee of any carrier who embezzles his employer's funds while riding either upon any vehicle belonging to his employer shall be guilty of a penalty -- of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.609" offset="1205791">The language in the statute, any carrier clearly covered all forms of carrier business regardless of size or their internal business structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.814" offset="1246647">Indeed, there is no question that appellee agrees that if 409 (a) (5) was the law today and the indictment was specifically drawn under that Section, the indictment was quite proper and authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.845" offset="1314774">The argument is made, however, that the Congressional purpose was changed and that the scope of 409 (a) (5) was narrow by virtue of its combination with what had been this executive provision, Section 412 of the 1946 Code which had proscribed embezzlements by any president, director, officer, or manager of any firm, association or corporation engaged in commerce as a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.650" offset="1446013">The result of the 1948 revision, the creation of Section 660, was that the language employee of any carrier was substituted and the language of the statute became an employee of any firm, association or corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.391" offset="1536920">All the trustworthy evidence we submit points to the fact that this was -- this change of the revises did not narrow the statute but was basically a stylistic change not certainly a change of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.927" offset="1603062">First of all, Section 412 as it had existed in the Criminal Code prior to the 1948 revision does not require such a reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.012" offset="1643395">It derives intact from Section 9 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.415" offset="1661053">Undeniably, this provision adopted almost 35 years before the 1948 revision was principally concerned and meant to prevent financial depletion of railroad businesses through executive embezzlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.929" offset="1731062">It is, however, also a fair inference we think to draw from both the language of the Section 9 and from some of the Senate debate that the intent was more broad -- was broader, that in addition to protecting against embezzlement by executives of railroads, Congress aimed at serving the public interest in protecting all interstate carriers from impairment of effective operation through embezzlement by executives.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.503" offset="1865435">As one of the managers of the Senate Bill said of Section 9, we are dealing with all carriers alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.992" offset="1895320">This view is supported by the language, the comprehensive language used.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.533" offset="1913501">If Congress have merely decided to reach multiple ownership carriers, the words “corporation and association” would have been sufficient since associations would include partnerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.561" offset="1965641">By also using the word firm, Congress, we submit indicated its intent to cover all carriers in the business of common carriage without regard to form of ownership, the form of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.514" offset="2029380">In addition, it is significant I think that Section 9 jurisdiction was not based upon size of the carrier but on the connection of the embezzled funds to commoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.905" offset="2095000">This provision, Section 9, was thereafter carried over into the Criminal Code in 1926, and every six to eight years thereafter, whenever a new addition of the Code was published, and in 1948 was combined with Section 409 (a) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="517.957" offset="2175248">There is no cogent reason apart from the language of 412 submitted by appellee or the court below why Congress would've limited the scope of 409 (a) (5) in the 1948 revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.349" offset="2232717">Appellee urges an explanation of this cutting down that the employees of individual carriers on -- on the truck employees of individual carriers and their acts of embezzlement would involve small amounts and not be within the congressional concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.789" offset="2310562">The sure answer to that is that the employee provision only applies to employees who worked on the trucks of carriers and whether the carrier is a multiple ownership carrier or individually owned carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.986" offset="2371271">It would have been very strange indeed, we submit, if Congress, having undertaken to protect the small as well as the large carriers would have through the -- by the way of a revision, change that purpose to exclude the individually owned small carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.543" offset="2449533">We have made a random survey of about ten percent of the -- some 11,700 odd common carriers with an annual revenue of $200,000 or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.774" offset="2506480">And we find that almost 40% of those carriers were individually owned, many operating under a company name and having over 2000 employees and during the same period of time, during 1964, only one percent of the carriers registered operated as partnerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.740" offset="2606373">Quite appropriate here is what the Court said in United States against A &amp; P Trucking Company at 358 U.S. which held that a partnership was an entity for purposes of criminal prosecution under the Motor Carrier Act of 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.955" offset="2671156">The Court said, the conclusion is not likely to be reached that Congress intended that some carriers should not be subject to the full gamut of sanctions provided for infractions of ICC regulations merely because of the form under which they were organized to do business.</text>

            <text syncTime="661.320" offset="2748688">I'm quoting from United States against A &amp; P Trucking Company, Your Honor at 358 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.932" offset="2783065">This approach which seems to us is even more applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.671" offset="2798007">It is difficult to believe that Congress could have intended that small carrier, the carrier perhaps more in need of protection than any other carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.509" offset="2841370">And would not be under the Act and that the jurisdiction would depend upon whether an individual chose to do business as a sole proprietorship even though he had the name company after the sole proprietorship or as a one-man corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.508" offset="2921409">Finally, we submit in this connection that Congress would hardly have sought this change if it so intended through the means of a revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.203" offset="2960175">The reviser's note accompanying Section 660 make plain that the original intent of Congress is preserved and that a uniform style of statutory expression is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.521" offset="3013465">Also, in the practice to Title 18 U.S.C. the reviser state in general, with few exceptions, the Code does not attempt to change existing law.</text>

            <text syncTime="857.381" offset="3532884">And this brings me precisely to the major argument that appellee makes, and that is that the word firm has some fixed indefinite common law meaning or other meaning which necessarily excludes carriers from coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.450" offset="4597217">It's interesting in this connection in terms of the word firm that appellee cites a case, an early Ohio case in which under that particular statute, the Court said that firm covers only partnerships and neither private corporations nor individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.216" offset="4664195">23 years later under an entirely different statute, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the word “firm” in common usage was sufficiently broad to cover corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.572" offset="4717693">And as a recent Wisconsin decision which suggest that the word “firm” means a business association, something perhaps less than a partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.792" offset="4770565">Our position is that the word “firm” should be determined in light of the particular statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.674" offset="4814033">It has no fixed and definite meaning that the common understanding it seems to us is when the word “firm” is used, it suggests a business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.904" offset="4963035">And we think, as I have said, that Congress clearly meant to protect the business of all common carriers from specific kinds of employee and executive embezzlement that the word “firm” can fairly be read to achieve that result.</text>
