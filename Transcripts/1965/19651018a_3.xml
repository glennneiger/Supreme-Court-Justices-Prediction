            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="14.887" offset="59455">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.063" offset="68232">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.673" offset="78681">This case brings to the Court for review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, affirming two orders of the Subversive Activities Control Board, each order is addressed to one of the petitioners and requires him to register with the Attorney General under Sections 8 (a) and (c) of the Subversive Activities Control Act and I quote, “As a member of the Communist Party of the United States of America, a Communist-action organization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="56.178" offset="224653">The Court has so -- the Board rather has so far issued similar orders against 40 other -- 41 other persons which it has been stipulated are to abide the result in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.229" offset="280869">The case is one of the sequels to the Court's 1961 decision in Communist Party versus Subversive Activities Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.398" offset="321515">There, as you will recall, the Court affirmed the Board's 1953 finding that the Communist Party is a Communist-action organization and the order that it register as such under Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.381" offset="389433">The Court held, however, that it was premature to decide whether enforcement of this order was constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.041" offset="428095">Under the Act's definitions, a Communist-action organization is a domestic agent of the World Communist Movement which Section 2 describes as a worldwide seditious conspiracy under the domination and control of the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.293" offset="513149">Section 8 (a) of the Act provides upon the failure of an organization to register as a Communist-action organization in obedience to a final registration order and to furnish the Attorney General with a list of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.306" offset="585143">It becomes the duty of each member to register himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.739" offset="606877">Failure to register is not punishable at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.170" offset="624640">However, Section 13 provides for Board proceedings on petition of the Attorney General for a finding that an accused individual is a member of a Communist-action organization and for an order that he register as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.548" offset="702171">One such a board order becomes final, failure to register is punishable by imprisonment for five years and a fine of $10,000 both penalties cumulative for each day that the failure to register continues.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="192.937" offset="771657">Is there a hearing provided that the Attorney General makes such an application to find the mem -- an alleged member -- a member?</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="201.900" offset="807497">There was in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="202.903" stopTime="359.953">
            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="202.903" offset="811572">There was in this case and I'll come to a description of that here momentarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.612" offset="830380">Section 8 (c) provides that the registration of an individual shall be accompanied by a registration statement containing such information as the Attorney General may by regulation prescribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.901" offset="891507">Failure to file a statement is punishable by a -- by imprisonment for five years and a $10,000 fine but noncumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.328" offset="941244">Under regulations of the Attorney General, registration under Section 8 (a) is accomplished by filing a form, IS-52a which appears at page 65 of our brief, signed by the registrant and stating, and again I quote, “that he hereby registers as a member of blank,” naming the organization, “a Communist-action organization”.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.885" offset="1063497">The registration statement under 8 (c) consists of a separate form, Form IS-52, which is reproduced at page 66 of our brief which calls for the registrant's name and address, his aliases, the date and place of his birth, the name of the Communist-action organization of which he is a member, and the offices and the organization held by him during the preceding year.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.928" offset="1183660">Now, the Communist Party did not register subsequent to this Court's decision of 1961, instead, it has resisted enforcement of the Board's order that it do so in criminal proceedings in which it has reasserted all the constitutional objections to enforcement which this Court held premature in the '61 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.901" offset="1291598">Its conviction in 1962 for failure to register was reversed by the Court of Appeals on the grounds that the Government had not met its burden of proving the existence of some person who is willing to incriminate himself by signing and submitting to the Attorney General of the required registration documents on behalf of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.162" offset="1388565">After the denial of certiorari, the Government moved for a retrial of this criminal case which is now scheduled to begin in the District Court on November first.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="359.953" stopTime="361.452">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="359.953" offset="1439765">Was there a new indictment with that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="361.452" stopTime="849.198">
            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="361.452" offset="1445721">There was also a new indictment and the Government is retrying the old indictment pursuant to the option that the Court of Appeals gave and the Government secured a new indictment charging a subsequent failure to register on the part of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.850" offset="1499324">The District Court consolidated the two indictments and the consolidated case is going to trial, as I say, in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.497" offset="1537985">Meantime, in 1962, the Attorney General instituted the present proceedings before the Board, alleging that the Communist Party had not complied with the order that it register, petitioners who are members of the party and that they had not registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.554" offset="1610188">In their answers to the Attorney General's petition, petitioners claim their Fifth Amendment privilege against being required to register and file a registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.391" offset="1653551">And on the same ground, decline to answer the allegations of the petition with respect to their membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.257" offset="1685002">They also in their answers denied the allegation of the petition that the party is a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.278" offset="1717081">The Attorney General's evidence consisted of the testimony of informer witnesses that the petitioners had attended party meetings and had been elected to party officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.268" offset="1761071">Petitioners offered no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.990" offset="1775909">In a report accompanying its order in the case of petitioner Albertson, the Board held that petitioners were bound by and could not relitigate the 1953 determination that the Communist Party is a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.106" offset="1848424">The Act neither requires nor was there any evidence or finding in the Board proceedings that petitioners had engaged in any unlawful conduct or advocacy, had knowledge of such conduct or advocacy on the part of the Communist Party or knew believed that it had the characteristics ascribed by the Act to Communist-action organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.828" offset="1955213">Petitioner's challenge of the Act and the orders is confined to constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.497" offset="1977887">We raise no evidentiary and no procedural issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.184" offset="2000666">The court below held that adjudication of the privilege issue which is in this case is premature and could be raised only in a criminal prosecution of the petitioners for failure to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.253" offset="2052911">And that the remaining issues are either likewise premature or are foreclosed by year 1961 decision in the Party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.706" offset="2090736">Now, before coming to petitioner's specific constitutional objections, I want first for a moment to examine the function or purpose of the member registration requirement of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.943" offset="2159700">The purpose of registration under the Act as stated in the report of the Senate Committee was and I quote, “to effect disclosure of the identity and propaganda of individual Communists and Communist organizations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="558.228" offset="2232842">Similarly, the Court in the Party case found constitutional justification for requiring the Party to register and disclose the names of its members in the need to strip what it called the mask of anonymity from an organization that Congress had declared to be a foreign control seditious conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.224" offset="2332839">Now, Mr. Forer and I, I'm sure the Court knows, disagree with the decision in the Party case for reasons that are eloquently stated in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.542" offset="2386129">But it is unnecessary to rephrase that ground here.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.606" offset="2406400">For the requirement of self-registration by members as distinguished from the requirement of organizational registration has no conceivable justification as a disclosure measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.611" offset="2466377">This is so because a person is not required to register as a member until after the Board has made the disclosure that he is a member by finding him to be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.469" offset="2521861">Self-registration as a member after the Board has found him to be one is therefore completely superfluous to any conceivable disclosure objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.076" offset="2576300">And the government's fruitless effort to unearth any other legitimate function for this self -- compulsory self-registration requirement confirms a fact that indeed it hasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.545" offset="2634083">The Government says that the major, embodied at one point calls the sole function of compulsory registration as a member is to enable the Attorney General to compile a centralized public roster of registrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.848" offset="2707331">But as it appears from Section 9 (a) of the Act, Congress made no provision for such a roster of individual members provided for such a roster of organi -- registered organizations but not of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.193" offset="2760725">And obviously, had it desired such a roster, it could have directed the Attorney General to compile one from the orders of the Board rather than to require self-registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.502" offset="2809940">Besides, it would be preposterous to suppose that Congress prescribed cumulative penalties amounting to life imprison -- imprisonment merely to -- for a refusal to cooperate with the Attorney General in this minor clerical duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.989" offset="2891860">The fact is that the object of self-registration is not to get disclosure but to get Communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.018" offset="2931984">The means used in the Act is to confront them with the alternatives of self-incrimination, self-defamation, and the sacrifice of privacy, conscience, and belief by registering or life imprisonment for non-registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.549" offset="3010142">The Act admits of no other rational interpretation and neither the Government nor the court below could offer one.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.332" offset="3053296">It is against this background that I turn to petitioner's specific constitutional objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.203" offset="3088718">Our first objection is that the requirement of self-registration requires petitioners to incriminate themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.541" offset="3126126">They claim their privilege as I indicated in their answers to the Attorney General's petitions and began in their petitions for review of the registration orders by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.329" offset="3181296">These claims were denied by the Attorney General in continuing to prosecute the proceedings by the Board in issuing the registration orders and by both in descending those orders in these review proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.687" offset="3246707">Under these circumstances as the Government now acknowledge, the court below was clearly in no error in holding that adjudication of the privilege issue is premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.728" offset="3302818">The Government now concedes that petitioner's claims are right for adjudication insofar as they are addressed to any form of registration and any form of registration statement that would meet the requirements of Section 8 (a) and (c) and the Board's orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.689" offset="3486720">Is that your understanding of their position?</text>

            <text syncTime="874.470" offset="3497796">Well, my under -- no, they say the same -- they say in words -- say the same thing about the act of registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.974" offset="3523814">But as I'll try to show, Justice Fortas, neither of their reservations, their reservations that I'm coming to as they make it are of no consequence as applied either to the act of registration or to the registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.236" offset="3580865">If you could give me just a moment, I think I'll make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.805" offset="3595180">What they urge is that the issue was premature insofar as petitioner's claims of privilege are addressed to particular items of both forms, the form of registration and the form of registration statement which are not required by the terms of the Act and the Board's orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.003" offset="3679922">Now, as it will appear in just a moment, there are no such items in Form IS-52a that is the registration form, except for the bare detail of the registrant's address.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.499" offset="3737913">And for reasons that I'll discuss later, the Government's reservation is likewise of no consequence with respect to Form IS-52 the registration statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.248" offset="3784934">But I'd like first to turn to the merits of petitioner's claims of privilege with respect to the bare requirement of registration under Section 8 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="960.858" offset="3843344">Section 8 (a) and Section 13 (g) of the Act, the orders of the Board and Form IS-52a, all specifically require each petitioner to register and I quote, “as a member of the Communist Party of the United States of America”, and thereby to admit membership in that organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.003" offset="3935922">Such an admission as this Court has frequently held is incriminating and may not be compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.963" offset="3963820">Moreover, Sections 8 (a) and 13 (g) seem to require a registrant not only to admit membership in the organization but to describe it as and thus to admit that it is a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.969" offset="4035814">The Government has so interpreted these two sections for the Board's orders and the Attorney General's form, all require petitioners to register not only as members of the Communist Party but as members of the Communist Party, a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.374" offset="4109479">This admission at the Communist Party has a criminal and conspiratorial character which the Act attributes to Communist-action organizations is of course also incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.502" offset="4161933">And if you'll look at, Mr. Justice Fortas, at the registration Form IS-52a, you'll observe that it requires nothing but these two admissions, an admission of membership and admission that the organization is a Communist-action organization other than appending the address of the registrant below as signatured.</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.853" offset="5363357">By the very nature of the case, any -- any questions that the Attorney General's got authority to ask under 8 (c) must necessarily be incriminating.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.543" offset="5418109">And petitioners have claimed their privilege against filing a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.660" offset="5446635">Now, coming back to -- to the act of registration under the Act of the Board's order and Form IS-52a, Congress itself was acutely aware of the fact that the self-registration of a person under Section 8 (a) as a member of a Communist-action organization, involves self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.303" offset="5561156">This appears from the fact that it added a partial immunity provision, Section 4 (f) to the Act and it's made even clearer by the legislative history of that section which is recounted in Scales versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.105" offset="5624372">Now, Scales indicated, however, and as Congress was frequently warned in the course of the debate, Section 4 (f) does not displace the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.002" offset="5667944">It provides first that membership in a Communist-action organization shall not constitute per se a violation of any criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.978" offset="5707860">This provision is inadequate since it does not protect against prosecutions for crimes like the membership clause of the Smith Act in which membership is only one ingre -- ingredient of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.856" offset="5763344">The section, second sentence of 4 (f) prohibits to recede an evidence of the registration of a person as a member of a Communist-action organization in a prosecution against him for violating Section 4 (a) or (c) or any other criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.202" offset="5840771">This provision is indistinguishable from the statute which Counselman versus Hitchcock invalidated because it did not afford the witness absolute immunity from prosecution for any offense to which the incriminating admission related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.416" offset="5905659">Now, the Government acknowledges as it must under Counselman that Section 4 (f) does not supplant the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.474" offset="5933871">Yet its argument was really its only argument that belies this acknowledgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.808" offset="5967203">The argument is that in view of the evidentiary bar of Section 4 (f), the privilege does not protect the person from being compelled to register as a member of the Communist Party because this admission of membership is not required until after such membership has been proved by the Attorney General in the Board proceeding, and says the Government it therefore appears that the admission will not furnish the Attorney General with any lead he does not already have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.940" offset="6135745">That's one of the questions I'd like -- that I -- that I ask also, Justice Black, because the fair majority in Brown versus Walker that -- that sustained a grant of absolute immunity as a substitute for the privilege did so on the theory that this was a necessary aid to law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.961" offset="6219755">But under the Government's theory, they can't compel an admission unless the admission is absolutely valueless to the prosecutor because it doesn't give him any -- any information or any leads that he can use for enforcement purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.705" offset="6278792">But the Government's proposition is, is that the statute of the Counselman type does supplant the privilege wherever the Government can show that it's already in possession of the incriminating information whose disclosure it seeks to compel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.767" offset="6343053">That is wherever it can show that the disclosure is valued most.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.390" offset="6361548">Acceptance of this proposition would make deep in roads under the protection -- protection which the privilege has long been held to afford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.768" offset="6399060">Up to now, a claim of privilege has been honored whenever the Court was able to discern some rational connection between the disclosures which is sought and some sort of criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.596" offset="6454335">No court has ever believed that it relevant to go on to inquire whether the Government already had knowledge of the facts which it seeks to elicit from the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.398" offset="6493518">And this has been so whether the inquiry arose on a proceeding to which a Counselman type of statute was applicable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.636" offset="6534478">For example, a Counselman type of statute used to be applicable to the inquiries of congressional committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.351" offset="6565303">Yet the Court as in the Chief Justice's decision in the Emspack case has sustained claims of privilege to the question, are you a member of the Communist Party?</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.472" offset="6613786">In situations where it appeared that the committee had evidence that the witness was a member and indeed as in the Emspack case where they had made a finding that the witness was a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.331" offset="6665300">The courts have always thought that circumstances like these showing at the body which subpoenaed the witness had incriminating evidence against him supported and bolstered his claim of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.551" offset="6730188">Now, the Government claims that it invalidates the assertion of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.327" offset="6757251">And as Justice Black has already pointed out, the purpose of extorting this kind of an admission or the extortion of this kind of an admission is as purposeless as it is unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.633" offset="6830498">Now -- now turning from the act of registration under Section 8 (a) to the registration statement required by Section 8 (c), if as I have urged, the petitioners cannot be compelled to register under Section 8 (a), it is our position that they're under no duty to comply with Section 8 (c) for the reasons that I've already indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.171" offset="6940630">Because of the text of the Act, because of the nature of the penalties, and finally because of principle of restrict construction of criminal statutes would require that kind of an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.119" offset="6992457">But even if our interpretation of 8 (c) as being ancillary only to registration under 8 (a) is rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.006" offset="7031954">It's perfectly obvious not only that particularly -- particular inquiries which the Attorney General has made in IS -- Form IS-52 call for incriminating answers but that any inquiries within the Attorney General's competence under Section 8 (c) would do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.474" offset="7117845">If the undefined authority of the Attorney General under 8 (c) to prescribe the form of registration statements is to escape condemnation as an invalid delegation of legislative power and the violation of the Fourth Amendment seems obvious that its authority must be confined to inquiries which bare some relation to the registrants, membership and activities in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.662" offset="7230589">And since federal legislation has made the Communist Party what the Court of Appeals called virtually a conspiracy per se, any such questions within the Attorney General's competence would obviously call for incriminating answers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1867.474" offset="7469871">And so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.601" offset="7478335">Now, generations of lawyers have advised their clients that in situations like that, you don't have to answer such questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.475" offset="7509891">And decisions, like Mr. Justice Clark's decision in Hoffman versus United States have sustained us in this advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.838" offset="7543327">Now, the Government tells us we've been all wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.543" offset="7554090">And that the answers can be compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.350" offset="7565375">Its contention, apart from the proposition that the privilege is inapplicable where the Government already knows the answers, is that what euphemistically calls identifying information, it's indistinguishable from fingerprinting and as outside the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.330" offset="7637264">Now, whatever may be the case with fingerprinting or other means of physical identification, the registration statement like the questioning of a prosecutor is a demand for communication and is indisputably within the protection of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.880" offset="7715422">We make four other constitutional objections to the member registration requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.380" offset="7741440">First, we say that since as I have shown, the requirement has no legitimate governmental purpose, the restraint which it imposes on individual liberty is a denial of substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.062" offset="7792222">Second, we say, that this due process defect is compounded by the fact that compulsories self-registration is a form of compelled communication and hence within the ambit of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.955" offset="7855752">The Act singles out the members of a particular group and compels them both to avow their political affiliation and to admit to the truth of the governmental finding that the party to which they belong is a seditious conspiracy under foreign control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.521" offset="7926073">The Act thus coerces persons to make those durations which are contrary to their conscience and belief, invasions of their privacy, and self-defamatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.883" offset="7975497">Moreover, the self-registration requirement is a restraint on the individual's right of association and for that reason also, they're subject to First Amendment limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.724" offset="8030877">Decisions of this Court,Mr. Justice Harlan's in Barenblatt for example, holding that the First Amendment did not prohibit inquiry into a person's membership in the Communist Party reached that conclusion on the ground that the Government's interest in obtaining an answer outweighed the interest of the individual in privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.685" offset="8126694">And it was on similar grounds that the Court sustained the registration order in the Party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.036" offset="8152085">Here, if we are once more to balance self-registration as I have shown, serves no conceivable public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.827" offset="8191269">So there is nothing to balance off against the claim of the individual to the protection of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.752" offset="8230975">Next, we argue that petitioners were denied procedural due process by the Act and the Board's ruling, both of which precluded them from challenging the 1953 determination that the Communist Party is a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.895" offset="8315507">This due process violation results first from the fact that the petitioners were not parties to the proceeding in which the determination was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.975" offset="8359811">Moreover, even if they could be held to be bound in their absence, they would still be entitled to litigate the current validity of this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.935" offset="8403696">Now, 12 years old and based primarily on what the Chief Justice characterized as stale evidence of the events that antedate 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.816" offset="8455210">The majority in the Party case held that the provisions of Section 13 of the Act, submitting a registered organization periodically to seek a redetermination of its status, saved the Act as to the organization from condemnation under the Due Process Clause and the prohibition against bills of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.978" offset="8547892">But the Communist Party cannot ask for a redetermination under Section 13 since it is not registered and is still litigating the constitutionality of the requirement that it do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.761" offset="8598988">Moreover, if it wins this litigation, establish its right not to be compelled to register, it can never apply for a redetermination under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.095" offset="8644336">And the Act does not permit a member to seek such a redetermination whether or not, he or the organization is registered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2274.382" offset="9097509">And the only proof that the Attorney General offered of that allegation was his request for judicial notice of the Board's 1953 determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.470" offset="9137842">The Party case also recognized that the validity of the Board's 1953 determination at any future time would depend upon the validity at that time of the Board's conclusion that the Soviet Union is the unnamed foreign power referred to in Section 2 which controls a monolithic world Communist movement described in that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.897" offset="9239510">Accordingly, the Court held that as due process requires, the soundness of this conclusion in the right -- in the light of the contemporaneous political realities would be subject to review by the Board or the courts in any subsequent proceeding under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.800" offset="9315161">Today, it is common knowledge that Communism is characterized by what the experts call polycentrism.</text>

            <text syncTime="2724.837" offset="10899331">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.819" offset="10915213">It seems clear that the central question in this case relates to the Fifth Amendment, although many other issues are raised both in their brief and in argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.781" offset="10959099">The First Amendment questions, we submit, are -- were substantially settled by this Court's decision in the Communist Party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.176" offset="11000686">They do make a -- a distinction here as to purpose -- as to governmental purpose following disclosure during the course of a Board proceeding and I intend to discuss that in a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.385" offset="11057528">But before discussing the Fifth Amendment question, I would like to take just a few minutes to discuss their contention that Section 4 (f) is not sufficiently sweeping to cover -- to preclude the use of the fact of registration for prosecution especially under Sections 5 and 15 of -- of the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.181" offset="11164630">They make the claim supposedly based on the legislative history of the statute that because the House version of the bill contained a specific provision which would have precluded the fact of registration from being used in connection with proving violations of Section 5 and 6 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.766" offset="11271001">And since those specific provisions were later eliminated following the conference between the House and the Senate, they conclude that it was thereby the intent of Congress to not have applicable to the violations set forth in Section 5 and 6, the immunity provisions of Section 4 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.502" offset="11377998">We think that the -- the history of the bills as they progress through the Congress makes it quite clear that Section 4 (f) was intended to be and does in fact in specific words, was intended to preclude the use of the fact of registration in any criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.096" offset="11504327">Now, the -- the Wood bill which was the House -- which was the bill that pass the House had in Sections 5 -- Sections 4, 5 and 6, each of which established new offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.132" offset="11572454">Each of those provisions in the Wood bill as it came out of the Committee provided that the fact of registration cannot be used in evidence to prove the violation previously set forth in this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.314" offset="11665241">So that each Section, 4, 5 and 6 had a similar provision and it related particularly to the section in which it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.333" offset="11709231">Now, on the floor of the House when the question was being debated, Congressman Cellar and Mark Antonio made the objection that the provision -- that the immunity provision set forth in -- in these sections was not sufficiently broad, that it would permit for example the use of the proof of the fact of registration in a Smith Act prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.920" offset="11799615">Since this clearly was not the intent of the sponsors of the bill, the bill was amended on the floor subsequently so that Section 4 (f) was made to read that the fact of registration shall not be received in evidence for a violation of subsection (a) and (c) of this -- this section which was the original wording and they added for in the prosecution of any other criminal case.Sections 5 and 6 were left as they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.067" offset="11936183">The Senate versions did not have comparable provisions in Sections 5 and 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.877" offset="11959484">That is they didn't have comparable immunity provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.111" offset="11972441">It did have a comparable Section 4 (f) without the phraseology for any other criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.177" offset="12008699">And when the bills went to Congress, the final version came out with Section 4 (f) being all inclusive or any other criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.191" offset="12064705">Nothing said in Section 5 or Section 6 obviously because they were already covered by the all inclusive wording or Section 4 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.533" offset="12114129">And the -- I think that that history coupled with the -- the very phraseology itself plus the fact -- plus the fact that it was a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.902" offset="12167523">The clear purpose of Congress in enacting this legislation was to require disclosure and not to secure incriminating admissions from the registrants.</text>

            <text syncTime="3133.253" offset="12532924">Now, that in it of itself would not meet the rule of the Counselman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.614" offset="12554449">But what takes this out of the rule of the Counselman case is the fact that in these cases, we have had a Board hearing at which the Attorney General at his initiative has been called upon and has produced evidence showing that these people are members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.974" offset="12647863">That fact, the fact that the Attorney General had the lead, so to speak, that these people were members of the Communist Party, was able to produce evidence sufficient to sustain the requirement of the Act to establish that they were members of the Communist Party, taken together with the -- what I will short handedly call the immunity provisions of Section 4 (f) are sufficiently effective to remove any -- any fear of self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.005" offset="13859944">The situation in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.169" offset="13876663">The question was whether a state immunity statute under which a witness was being compelled to answer was sufficient to give him immunity from federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.135" offset="13956493">Now, this Court in the -- in the Murphy case laid down the ruling that if he was compelled in a state proceeding to testify in an incriminatory fashion concerning criminal offenses that the Fifth Amendment would bar the use by the federal government not only of the evidence to which he testified but of leads derived from such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.189" offset="14072686">So that -- so that the Court was saying that although his testimony is compelled and some other jurisdiction might secure leads, the Fifth Amendment would not permit those leads to be used against him in a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.105" offset="14136320">So that it seems to me what the Court has said in -- in the Murphy case, what it was saying in Counselman is that if the circumstances under which he is called upon to -- to testify or to make an admission or such, if the circumstances are such that his answers cannot possibly incriminate then his Fifth Amendment claim is of no avail to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="5867.844" offset="23471334">And as this Court held in the Sullivan case that the fact of certain information required should be stated on your income tax form might be incriminatory and concerning which you might be able to invoke the proper Fifth Amendment claim then it did not permit you to take the position that you would file no return at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="6067.652" offset="24270576">The Court in the Party case held that that was a matter of statutory construction which would be resolved on -- on a matter of judicial notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="6213.477" offset="24853838">For example, in every proceeding now before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, in order to satisfy this Court's decision on requiring and showing of pertinency, the Committee first calls a whole series of so-called friendly witnesses who would testify that X, as a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6233.844" offset="24935340">And then they call X and they say, “We have evidence before us and we found that you're a member of the Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="6245.592" offset="24982361">Under Mr. Maroney's argument, this claim of privilege wouldn't all -- would be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.289" offset="25025097">Similarly, before a grand jury, if a statute of the Counselman type or applicable to some kind of a proceeding before the grand jury, prosecutor is accustomed at first call, all of the prosecuting witnesses who would identify the accused as a person who commits a -- has committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.436" offset="25113704">The grand jury transcript which show all these evidence, then they'd call the accused and say, “Are you -- are you the fellow that -- that did this thing?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6286.998" offset="25147977">And if the man has searched his privilege, they take him before the judge and they say, “Here judge, here's the transcript of his -- of our grand jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6294.026" offset="25176085">Look at this mountain of evidence we have that the man is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6296.922" offset="25187683">Obviously, he has no privilege under those circumstances.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6299.650" offset="25198550">That's Mr. Maroney's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.740" offset="25218926">Beyond that, I think, it should be bore in mind that -- that this isn't a taste like Counselman that concerned some commercial transaction, a grain merchant who was receiving illegal railroad rebates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6321.097" offset="25284336">This is a case in which the claim of the Fifth Amendment is raised in the context of a prosecution for political affiliation and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6335.751" offset="25342955">The case in which the Fifth Amendment has its historic and traditional relationship to -- to First Amendment rights and it's in that context that the claim of privilege has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.067" offset="25400216">Now, Mr. Maroney, as in the Government's brief, keeps on repeating the fact that the decision in the Party case is controlling here on the issue of the First Amendment because in the Party case, it was held that Congress has the -- the right to require disclosure and stripped the mask of anonymity from the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.279" offset="25505019">But the Government ignores and continues to ignore and will never recognize is that whatever justification this removal of the so-called mask of anonymity might give to the provisions for a registration by the organization, it can't excuse the requirement of self-registration because the mask of anonymity has been stripped; disclosure has been made by the finding of the Board itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6408.732" offset="25634900">And in First Amendment terms, this case is just like the Barnette case, the Flag Salute case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6418.960" offset="25675755">The question here is whether the Government has got the right to compel a man to come forward and avow, not only to avow his political association but against his conscience and belief to declare that the organization of which he is associated is a criminal conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6445.405" offset="25781603">In Mr. Justice Jackson in the Barnette case said that you couldn't compel a person by sign or symbols to indicate his acquiescence in the political ideas that flag salute speaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.848" offset="25839386">So we say here, the First Amendment again stands as a bar to compelling persons by registration, by the sign and symbol of registration to indicate their acquiescence in the political beliefs that the McCarran Act speaks, this Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6482.211" offset="25928829">And the best evidence of the fact that -- that this is a requirement -- much as requirement and the requirement that invades a conscience and belief of the person who's compelled to make such a sign and symbol is a fact that in all these years and under the threat of all these penalties, not a single person has yet registered as a member of the Communist Party with the Attorney General under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6509.487" offset="26037917">Thank you very much.</text>
