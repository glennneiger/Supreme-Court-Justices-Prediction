            <text syncTime="47.442" offset="293177">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.814" offset="310627">This is an action by six veterans of World War II against their former employer, the Pennsylvania Railroad to enforce claims based on the Section 8, the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.507" offset="373426">The Act provides for the representation of such claimants by the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.866" offset="398817">Petitioners prevailed in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.709" offset="410206">But the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed cases here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.115" offset="435806">The facts were stipulated and may be briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.502" offset="457331">Petitioners were hired in 1941 and 1942 as firemen on tugboats operated by the Railroad in New York Harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.068" offset="499649">Shortly after being hired, they left to enter military service in World War II and after serving for about three years, were honorably discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.775" offset="542490">The railroad as required in Section 8 (b) of the Act, restored petitioners to their old jobs as firemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.071" offset="583659">In 1959, the job of firemen or as sometimes called oilier on all for the railroads diesel tugboats in New York Harbor was abolished on the ground that diesel tugboats don't need a fireman.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.640" offset="645935">And this action of the railroad precipitated a major strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.122" offset="663907">The strike was settled by an agreement between the railroad and the union representing its employees which provided among other things for separation allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.280" offset="712495">That is severance pay to be given those employees like petitioners whose jobs were abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.533" offset="753455">Now, the amount of these separation allowances was measured by the number of months of the employees compensated service for the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.410" offset="800998">Compensated service, being a term defined in this fashion, a month of compensated service was any month in which the employee had worked at least one day for the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.404" offset="853034">And a year of compensated service was 12 such months or a major portion thereof, seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.782" offset="890546">These petitioners, these veterans, of course, had not been able to work one day of month during their three years in military service in World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.246" offset="932342">And the railroad decided that their period of military service should not be counted as compensated service for purpose of computing the amount of the separation allowances to which they were entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.163" offset="995976">And the result was that each of these petitioners received some $1200 less in separation allowances than he would have received had his military service been counted or in other words had his civilian employment with the railroad never been interrupted by military service.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.989" offset="1119378">Stay on and they have 20 years to stay on that the job?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Posner</label>
            <text syncTime="259.740" offset="1142366">Employees who had 20 years seniority, seniority being measured from first being hired by the railroad were given an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.105" offset="1183744">Petitioner Accardi was the only one of the six veterans who qualified who have the 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.601" offset="1209762">He is the only one could elect and he elected instead to take these -- to take his separation allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.760" offset="1246438">Now, Section 8 (c) of the Selective Training and Service Act requires that any veteran who is restored to his former civilian employment, as Section 8 (b) requires and as was done here, shall be restored without loss of seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.155" offset="1328044">And the only issue in this case is whether these petitioners were denied seniority in being refused separation allowances in an amount equal to what they would have received had their military service, had their civilian employment not been interrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.981" offset="1419264">This issue in turn ends on how two questions were answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.990" offset="1447372">The first is whether the measure of the separation allowances, what the contract between the union and the railroad calls length of compensated service was seniority in the statuary sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.330" offset="1516648">And the second question is, if so, are these allowances accorded on the basis of seniority the kind of benefits which the Act means to protect for the veteran?</text>
            <text syncTime="371.222" offset="1588224">And the first of these questions requires us to examine the concept of seniority as it's used in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.723" offset="1626258">And I think we can usefully approach this by asking why Congress should have selected seniority as a standard of the veterans' reemployment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.838" offset="1686758">It's clear I think what the basic impulse behind these veterans legislation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.085" offset="1715702">It's the feeling that veterans should not be penalized in their civilian employment careers, by reason of having been called into the armed services in an hour of the country's great need.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.234" offset="1784351">On the other hand, if this thought, this desire for equality were carried to its logical extreme, the results would be rather disruptive and impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.141" offset="1835969">Because if one really wants to fully equalize the employments status of a veteran and of a nonveteran, that would mean, for example, compiling the employer to make up the difference in pay scales between the armed forces and the civilian employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.509" offset="1925413">Or it might require compelling an employer to attribute to a veteran a skill or qualification that he might have received had he not been inducted into the armed forces but that he didn't receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.397" offset="2000959">In other words, there are difficult questions in social policy involved in -- if one is to go so far as to require an employer to pay a veteran for work he didn't do or for a skill he didn't attain, although he would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.542" offset="2069504">On the other hand, as Congress well knew, at least in those industries where collective bargaining with independent unions is the prevailing mode of regulating industrial relations, many of the perquisites of employment, promotions of various sorts, wage increases, vacation rights, retirement rights, order of lay-off and recall, are made to flow automatically from the length of the employee's service with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.965" offset="2215267">And these benefits or perquisites are not intended to compensate an employee for the work he's done or as an incentive better work in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.143" offset="2263960">And if you require just these benefits, benefits which are accorded mechanically, automatically on a basis of time served to a veteran as if he had never been inducted, you don't have any of these disruptive effects on the employer's managerial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.687" offset="2358105">And we submit that in making seniority the statutory test to these veterans' employment rights, Congress meant to protect for the veteran this entire range of benefits which are conferred on the basis of how long you've been on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.870" offset="2430830">And don't have any implication of the reward for the value the employee's contribution or for the skill of his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.983" offset="2483284">And if this is the proper test, then clearly, the veterans in this case were improperly denied separate -- the full separation allowances to which they were entitled because the measure used in this agreement defined the amount of separation allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.577" offset="2565726">What the parties called length of compensated service was in all practical respects a measure based on time of the employee in the railroads employ and it had nothing to do with attempting to compensate employees for their particular contributions to the railroad's business or for the skills they had attained or anything of that sort.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="645.122" offset="2683904">If the collective bargaining agreement was giving them a lump sum which is less and what they would've earned have they been working during -- that they would have received a period of service, you wouldn't quarrel with that?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_a_posner" startTime="657.846" stopTime="698.523">

            <text syncTime="658.167" offset="2736044">There is no requirement that -- if I understand your question correctly that the employer pay any amount in lieu of wages for the period when the veteran was in the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.253" offset="2792364">He didn't work for the employer he is not entitled to any wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.007" offset="2807411">Now, these separation allowances are not a -- they're not an end of employment bonus or additional wage compensation, they're a method of a tiding over the employee in readjusting to another job to his lost of this job.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Posner</label>
            <text syncTime="705.707" offset="2926216">Yes, they are in essence an exchange for giving up your job rights for what you're going to do in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.944" offset="2963101">And they were provided here on a basis simply, in all practical sense, simply on how long you happen to have been around the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.635" offset="3001866">An employee who started work the same day as these veterans in 1941 or 1942 and who worked, he may have worked very sporadically over 20 years but nevertheless managed to put in at least one day a month, he would be entitled to a far larger separation allowance than a veteran who worked steadily.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.078" offset="3103640">All of the 17 years he was on the job but of course during the three years of his military service couldn't render this nominal service of one day a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.517" offset="3153481">And this kind of inequity, this arbitrary, a distinction and treatment between veterans and nonveterans, we think, is just the kind of inequity that the statute was meant to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.302" offset="3212622">Because from the employer standpoint, he can treat the veteran and the nonveteran alike in terms of these separation allowances without being involved in problems of paying compensation for work that that wasn't done.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.896" offset="3303006">I might say that on this first point, the court below was in agreement with the Government's position, although the respondent has taken vigorous issue with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.616" offset="3369880">The court agreed that these separation allowances were measured by seniority by length of service within the meaning of the statutory term.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.109" offset="3415855">What troubled the court was, some additional language in Section 8 (c) which in the court's view carve out a set of benefits as to which the veteran and doesn't have the right to be treated the same as his co-workers who were not inducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.819" offset="3502686">This language which is set out on page 3 our brief is the first and third clauses of 8 (c), where it says that any person who is restored to a position as required by the Act shall be considered as having been on furlough or leave of absence during his period of training and service and shall be entitled to participate in insurance or other benefits offered by the employer pursuant to the established rules and practices relating to employees on furlough or leave of absence in effect with the employer at the time such a person was inducted into the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.803" offset="3694634">Now, what the court below felt was that there is a -- there is this category of insurance or other benefits which the court felt included these separation allowances as to which you treat the restored veteran, as if he had been on a leave of absence rather than as if he had been working during his period in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.352" offset="3812812">Now, we read this language in 8 (c), these leave of absence benefits created in the statute, rather differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.690" offset="3858160">This language on which the court relied was added, as we explain more fully in our brief, as an amendment to the basic bill which had created these veteran reemployment rights based on seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.481" offset="3925347">And the purpose of this additional language was not to curtail or qualify those rights, carve out an exception for some seniority rights, but to create additional rights, and specifically as the legislative history indicates, the intent was to protect the continued participation by inducted employees in group insurance plans which employers set up with their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.853" offset="4058781">Now, under these group insurance plans, the plan would continue in effect, continue to protect an employee even if happen to be laid off or take a leave of absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.015" offset="4115414">And what Congress desired was that when a man was called into the armed forces he should be treated no worse in terms to these insurance programs than his co-workers who might be on leave of absence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.108" offset="4251773">I think the language is broad enough to embrace any benefit which employers extend to their furloughed employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.176" offset="4300048">It seems to me, if -- another example doesn't come to mind but whatever benefits at the time these people were called into the service, the railroad had in effect four furloughed employees, would continue to accrue in favor of these inducted men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.050" offset="4387610">They wouldn't lose the benefit of this merely by being inducted, and if -- so that what we're talking about here is benefits of the pre-restoration stage in the employee's career.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.010" offset="4455424">While he's in the service, he's entitled to these 8 (c) leave of absence benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.813" offset="4482591">When he's restored to his civilian employment, he then becomes entitled to all benefits perquisites of seniority which may accrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.422" offset="4533060">Here, these separation allowances were first created in 1960 long after these veterans returned from the service and were available to employees in the service of the company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1225.543" offset="5005563">But if the employer decides that furloughed employees are entitled to a continuing share in the profits, it seems entirely fair and inconsonance with the benevolent purposes of this legislation that a person involuntarily furlough because he was called into armed forces should be entitled to the same profit sharing or other benefits as a man, an employee, who likewise is not actually rendering service because he's on furlough.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.269" offset="6408443">I think I should underline that the real issue here is whether or not there is anything in the provisions of the Selective Service Act, specifically provisions in the Section 8 (c) which should be read to override the plain provisions of a collective bargaining agreement that was freely negotiated and freely arrived at by the employer and the union representing the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.429" offset="6553057">And I think, to see this issue in its proper setting it would be helpful if I make a somewhat in large statement of the facts gave a somewhat greater interpretation of the agreement than has thus far been placed before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.026" offset="6659427">As the Court has been informed, when these petitioners went in the military service back in 1943, there were no provisions in the collective bargaining agreement for separation pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.341" offset="6720763">Separation pay was a thing unheard of so far as the railroad was concerned in any of its collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.139" offset="6755976">And that was so for many years after these veterans were restored, and when they were restored after their completion of their military service, they were restored with seniority date which in every way complied with the provisions of the Selective Training and Service Act of Section 8 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.601" offset="6833821">That is included -- stipulated in the stipulation which is in the record before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.833" offset="6862660">Now, these petitioners had no antecedent rights to separation allowances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.832" offset="6910725">We come now down to 15 years later, in the year 1959, and at that time a labor dispute arose between not only the Pennsylvania Railroad, but seven other railroads who operate railroad tugs in New York Harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.157" offset="6983973">Between them and the employees who perform the duties of the job classification known as oilers on those tugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.004" offset="7031411">And this dispute precipitated a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.651" offset="7053981">It was a strike that tied up the movement of the rail freight and the harbor of the City of New York for some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.667" offset="7082088">It eventually resulted in litigation which finally reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.888" offset="7106957">And ultimately, after these many months of turmoil, the parties got together and they solved their differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.037" offset="7151470">This agreement that they made was a two-pronged agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.179" offset="7188041">First, it provided that all employees in the oilers classification who had seniority of 20 years or more could stay on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.858" offset="7246764">And in computing seniority, full credit was given to the time of the veterans in military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.632" offset="7285948">When it came to measuring the quantum of the separation allowance, here the parties bargained for a separation allowance based on a measuring run of length of compensated service and this length of compensated service by its definition excluded the period of time that these petitioners spent in military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.981" offset="7391274">And also, another very vital point, excluded the time of any other employees who were on furlough during the course of their employment for any other nonmilitary reason and there were many of those.</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.991" offset="8911287">Now here, the plain fact is that the employer and the union negotiated a settlement of this strike by awarding separation allowances based not on seniority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.292" offset="10272580">Never got into the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.217" offset="10280208">And the record -- the stipulation in the record affirmatively shows or stipulates that this agreement was made in good faith and there was an affidavit before the Court, which was not contradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.569" offset="10349693">An affidavit submitted on behalf of the railroad which stated by a person who was involved in the negotiations that there was no intention on the part anybody to discriminate against veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.644" offset="10401938">Now, let me point out what might have happened if the parties had attempted to accommodate this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.549" offset="10445615">Our basic position is that they were not required by Section 8 (c) to accommodate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.577" offset="10465677">But let's suppose that it had been raised and they have attempted to accommodate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.679" offset="10490128">I think the only thing that can realistically be hypothesized here is that they would have tried to rearrange the formula to still fit within the total cost of the package.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.991" offset="10551359">And they probably would have then, if they gave the veterans credit for their time in military service, would have given the other furloughed employees credit for their time while they were laid-off or on leave of absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.429" offset="10617083">And in the end, these veterans might have gotten a less individual benefit than they've already received, because this would necessarily have deluded the benefit that went to each individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.619" offset="10673821">Now, I think that it's a matter of fact the agreement itself --</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.109" offset="10771832">I think there is another significant provision that is directly relevant to the point that I was just making, Your Honor, contained on page 12 of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.593" offset="10821778">You will note down there under paragraph 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.933" offset="10847065">The parties addressed themselves to the question of the New York Central Railroad Company which at that time didn't have any diesel tugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.283" offset="10880502">They had steam tugs but they were planning a diesel operation and they were looking forward when they planned the diesel operation to laying-off these oilers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.546" offset="10917595">And the agreements specifically says as dieselization proceeds the parties will endeavor to accommodate the principles adopted herein to the success of steps of dieselization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.474" offset="10965243">The carrier shall not be required to provide any benefits more extensive or relatively more expensive than those provided herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.789" offset="10998575">Obviously, what the railroads were interested in was in achieving their objective within their own financial limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.094" offset="11039744">Presumably, each one had put a limit on the amount to the package, the amount he was willing to pay to achieve this objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.762" offset="11070464">And if substantial additional cost is now to be imposed upon them, we think that certainly it's not required by Section 8 (c) and would be obviously inequitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.001" offset="11115395">Now, I would like to close by saying a word about the last clause of Section 8 (c) which -- Section 8 (c) contains four different provisions with respect to veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.155" offset="11232005">It says, first, that after they're restored, they shall be considered as having been on furlough or leave of absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.424" offset="11265024">Now, that's just exactly the way we treated them as though they've been on furlough or leave of absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.994" offset="11291355">So we have certainly complied with that part of Section 8 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.872" offset="11314866">But the last clause is the one to which I would like to direct the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.150" offset="11339943">And that is the clause which provides that he after being restored and given these rights, he shall not be discharged from such position without cause within one year after such restoration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.839" offset="11394696">Now, this Court has held in the Oakley case that that one year period is not a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.826" offset="11446627">Nevertheless, in Whirl Mobiles, this Court held that that did apply not only to discharges but to the cutting back of any other kind of employment benefits which a veteran had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.011" offset="11515382">So that while in the Oakley case, it was held to be not a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.707" offset="11554252">It stands here in the statute as testimony of Congress' intent that these benefits not be frozen into the employment relationship per omnia saecula saeculorum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.401" offset="11616946">And here, we have a collective bargaining agreement and into 15 years after these people completed their period of military service and we thing that the agreement was nondiscriminatory at its terms excluded there time in military service and if the judgment below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.949" offset="11695208">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.341" offset="11864691">The first is that in the Fishgold case, the leading case in by Mr. Justice Douglas in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.384" offset="11892903">The Court stated explicitly that the parties in their contract could not cut down the rights of veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.403" offset="11924982">But I think beyond that, this case illustrates how if you permit the parties to have carte blanche in dealing with these rights of seniority the results are anomalous because Mr. Butler concedes that if pure length of service were the criteria these veterans would be entitled to equal treatment with nonveterans.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.045" offset="12035532">But on the other hand do you concede that the parties that the employer here and they could agree now to make earnings the basis for seniority and therefore not include any times spent in the military?</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.205" offset="12272201">Your point is that the man -- if an employer is going out of business and he's going to make a separation pay provision, well then -- and it's going to be based on anything that is related to employment which the veteran could not perform because he was in the service.</text>
