            <text syncTime="146.420" offset="689089">The first question is the time of the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.921" offset="703091">That is when you will deduct what you have deducted at the time you incur it or whether you will postpone it until you --</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack S. Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="155.422" offset="725034">-- disposed of an asset and deducted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.578" offset="737677">The second question is the type of income against which that expenditure will be offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.234" offset="760351">That is whether ordinary income or capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.110" offset="775816">And these are the two question which we must answer in this case, which regard to the costs of raising breeding livestock, stated as Your Honor has stated it, whether they get a deduction as they expend their money for raising their livestock, their breeding livestock, or whether they must add the expenses to the basis of the livestock and then deduct them from the sales proceeds in computing gain from the sale of that livestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.627" offset="881873">This is livestock, which typically they raised from birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.625" offset="893889">And if they deducted all of the expenses of raising them --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="200.257" offset="904443">That'd be a zero base?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack S. Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="200.575" offset="905697">-- when they sold them, they would have a zero basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.614" offset="917817">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.099" offset="923773">There are nine cases consolidated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.347" offset="936730">Respondents and all of them raised livestock, mostly cattle but including some sheep and goats, and they hold these livestock for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.943" offset="975182">As an incident to their business of raising livestock for sale, they also raise breeding cattle, breeding livestock, which they used to produce their beef animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.579" offset="1029726">A rancher's income derived from selling beef animals is ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.533" offset="1053550">It's like the cost -- it's like the income from selling shoes to a manufacturer of shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.213" offset="1080195">A -- the rancher's income from selling his breeding cattle is capital gain, like the shoe manufacturer's income from selling his shoe machinery because the breeding cattle are used in his trade or business to produce his inventory, that is his beef animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.200" offset="1164204">All of the respondents have elected the accrual method of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.982" offset="1179251">And during the years here in question, they complied with the Treasury Regulations, which required them to defer the costs of raising both their beef animals and their breeding animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.690" offset="1238183">They deferred these costs and with regard to the animals sold and the years here in question, they deducted those deferred costs in computing their gain, which in the case of beef animals was ordinary income and the case of breeding animals, was capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.179" offset="1312057">Thereafter, the respondents filed claims for refund in which they argued that the Treasury Regulations were invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.200" offset="1348211">And that they were really entitled to deduct the costs of raising their breeding cattle as incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.341" offset="1376737">They said that they were content to continue to defer the cost of raising their beef cattle, but that they wanted to deduct the costs of raising breeding cattle as incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.582" offset="1417697">Thus, having a zero basis as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, so that when they sold their breeding cattle, they would have capital gain to the extent of 100% of the sales proceeds, whereas when they sold their beef cattle they were perfectly content to report only the gain, that is the excess of the sales proceeds over the accumulated costs of raising as ordinary income gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.100" offset="1511737">Although two circuits have rejected this argument that the regulations were invalid, the Fifth Circuit in this case reluctantly held the regulations invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.260" offset="1552384">It did so in two per curiam opinions, in which it stated that it felt bound by its previous opinion in Scofield versus Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.426" offset="1589060">The Fifth Circuit said, “While we are fully cognizant of the anomaly of allowing such tax treatment of the capital asset and appreciate the appealing conceptual arguments of the Government, we regard Scofield is controlling until its legislative or judicial demise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="392.386" offset="1672965">With regard to every business expenditure, as I've said before, there are these two questions, that is the timing of the deduction and the type of income against which is to be offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.183" offset="1716120">Normally, all taxpayers --this is not referring here the necessarily ranchers or farmers -- but all taxpayers, are required to accumulate rather than to deduct immediately the cost of producing assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.546" offset="1769514">And that is true whether those assets are inventory or a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.957" offset="1787173">Then they offset the -- these costs against the proceeds derived from the sale of the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.251" offset="1812355">If their assets were inventory, they get -- their net income produced by offsetting the accumulated cost of producing the asset against these sales proceeds, are ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.464" offset="1861256">If that asset happens to be a capital asset, such as a machine used to produce inventory, they have capital gain.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.620" offset="2409827">However, because of the peculiarities of livestock accounting, the taxpayers, the ranchers frequently find themselves with a basis which is so low, merely the expenses of raising the animal, that they are less than what the animal will eventually bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.315" offset="2472626">Because when it's -- when they finish, whether it is a breeding animal, they sell it as a beef animal and they get the full -- the full selling price from it.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.657" offset="2629987">Birth to maturity, when it's put into service.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.755" offset="2642422">Now, in the -- as I've said, taxpayers and virtually all industries are required regardless of the method of accounting or regardless of whether we're talking about inventory or capitalize assets accumulate deferential sale, the costs of manufacturing the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.855" offset="2710758">Now, in the early 1920s, the Commissioner recognized that many small farmers and ranchers were unable to perform that the bookkeeping, and accounting, and allocation tasks necessary to accumulating the costs -- properly accumulating the cost of raising crops and livestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.880" offset="2794872">So, it created in the regulations two methods of livestock accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.948" offset="2819114">He created first, a simplified cash method of accounting under which he relaxed the normal rule of capitalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.758" offset="2850356">The regulations provide that with respect to taxpayers, ranchers and farmers who elect the simplified cash method of accounting, they may expense as incurred, take a deduction as incurred, for all of the cost of raising their crops and their livestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.503" offset="2917334">They need to accumulate no basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.852" offset="2930813">However, as the taxpayers who elect the more sophisticated accrual method of accounting, and this method of accounting was made available because it is a much more accurate method.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.266" offset="2972400">It prevents normally income from going up and down as a cash method taxpayer would have it and tends to equalize income.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.948" offset="3003120">Therefore, the big ranchers normally prefer the more accurate accrual method of accounting, big ranchers and farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.004" offset="3027362">As to the accrual method of accounting, he'll -- he continued the normal rules under which the rancher or farmer would continue to defer and accumulate until sale the cost of raising crops and livestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.033" offset="3091519">Until 1942, from the early ‘20s when these regulations were adopted, until 1942, this created only one difference between the cash and accrual rancher.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.357" offset="3136763">That is a question of timing, when he deducted the cost of raising his livestock at the time incurred or at the time the animal sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.859" offset="3174797">However in 1942, Congress enacted Section 117 (j) of the Code, the Internal Revenue Code in 1939, it's now Section 1231.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.804" offset="3214608">This section granted capital gain treatment for the first time to ranchers -- well, it granted capital gain treatment to, is to gains from the sale of property used in the trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.700" offset="3270196">The Commissioner quickly conceded that at least as to some breeding cattle, they were property used in the trade or business and they were entitled to capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.597" offset="3309798">The Court shortly overruled the Commissioner's distinctions and said, no all breeding cattle, all breeders are entitled to capital grain -- gain treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.976" offset="3343235">And Congress codified this view into Section 1231 in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.028" offset="3367476">Now, after this amendment to the Code, the gain from breeders constituted capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.477" offset="3397256">The gain from beef animals constituted ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.846" offset="3410735">And this created a second difference between cash and accrual-method taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.719" offset="3430275">Cash-method taxpayers deducted all the cost of raising their breeders as incurred against ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.870" offset="3466846">Accrual-method ranchers deferred the costs of raising their breeders and deducted them at the time of sale against the sales proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.044" offset="3503522">In other words, they deducted them against capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.835" offset="3522748">To illustrate in a simple example, the difference between these two, a cash -- in accrual-method taxpayer who raised a breeder for $100 and then sold it $150, we have no deduction at the time he incurred the $100 of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.185" offset="3588159">That is over perhaps a five-year period or three-year period of raising the animal to maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.811" offset="3606653">At the time he sold the animal for $150, he would deduct his $100 of costs, which he'd accumulated as a cost basis, against the $150 of sales proceeds, and he would report it $50 capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.363" offset="3660779">The cash-method rancher on the other hand, would deduct the $100 of costs as he incurred, having a $100 deduction against ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.817" offset="3702680">When he sold the breeder, he would have $150 of capital gain because he would have no basis accumulated to offset against the sales proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.889" offset="3742908">Now, what this -- what resulted from this was a distortion in the income of the cash basis taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.062" offset="3779584">The accrual-method rancher was reporting his income precisely correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.397" offset="3796929">He did have $50 capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.539" offset="3809573">The cash-method rancher reported that transaction as if he'd had a $25 loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.860" offset="3838830">Here's what I mean by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.079" offset="3843636">He took a $100 deduction from his ordinary income at the time he incurred the expenses, he had a $150 gain, capital gain on the sale of the animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.624" offset="3893896">But capital gain is taxable at a maximum rate of one-half of your normal ordinary income rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.944" offset="3923153">In other words, the maximum rate that can be assessed against capital gain is to divide your capital gain by two and put half of it in ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.707" offset="3954186">So in other words, the cash basis rancher -- when he really had a $150 capital gain, put that into ordinary income as a $75 gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.586" offset="3993684">One-half of capital gain is taxable as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.773" offset="4006431">So, he had a $100 deduction at the time he raised the animal and a $75 gain at the time he sold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.986" offset="4035271">He thus had, letting the two together, a $25 loss on the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.496" offset="4065364">Now, the Commissioner shortly recognized that this was not the way in which a cash method taxpayer should ideally be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.538" offset="4113533">He recognized, however, that he had given this requirement of accumulation or deferral of cost away with regard to the cash basis taxpayer or rancher in the first place, in order to give them a simple method of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.611" offset="4165778">The Commissioner was reluctant to withdraw it and to immediately begin requiring the cash-method rancher to accumulate, in other words, to take away from a simple method of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.577" offset="4213635">But after a couple of years of pondering the situation, a relatively few years in which it was determined that all breeders are illegible for capital gain, the Commissioner then wished to require cash-method ranchers to accumulate the cost of raising breeders, recognizing that this would withdraw some of the simplicity of their methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.204" offset="4300152">However, a careful examination of the status of the legislative history and the Code at that time convinced the Commissioner that he was precluded by Congress from doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.481" offset="4353337">For 30 years, cash-method ranchers at that time was 30 years, had been permitted to deduct as incurred the cost of raising breeders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.226" offset="4392312">During this period, the Code had been reenacted in numerous times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.902" offset="4406941">Moreover, and of even more significant, is the fact when Congress in 1951, specifically codified in Section 1231 the concept that all breeders are entitled to capital gain treatment under this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.854" offset="4466813">The legislative history showed that Congress recognized that there were two methods of accounting for breeders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.515" offset="4497429">One, the cash simple method and the other, the accrual more sophisticated method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.885" offset="4514879">And that Congress recognized that some ranchers would compute gain one way and other ranchers the other way and approved this method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.020" offset="4551450">The Commissioner would have rightly or wrongly felt himself bound by this legislative history and the statutory reenactment over 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.252" offset="4588335">He felt that he could not administratively withdraw from the cash-method taxpayers the right to deduct their expenses as incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.137" offset="4627937">Therefore, he went to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.278" offset="4636505">The Secretary of the Treasury in 1952 wrote a letter to Congress, requesting legislation which would require cash-method ranchers to accumulate the cost of raising breeders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.006" offset="4687391">At approximately the same time, representatives of the livestock industry went to Congress and a bill was introduced, authorizing accrual-method ranchers to write off their costs as incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.333" offset="4744756">In other words, just exactly what the respondents are here requesting.Congress took no action on either one of these proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.375" offset="4780910">Instead, in 1954, two years later, Congress reenacted the relevant code provisions verbatim in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.185" offset="5312136">One reason to do it is that the accrual method of accounting still has certain advantages, it has certain disadvantages but it has certain advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.896" offset="5346931">In cases of draught, large forced sales and other such circumstance, a cash-method rancher would have a great bunching of his income in one year, which might push him up into the 70% bracket.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.842" offset="5790699">Respondents made three specific tax on the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.384" offset="5808880">First they say, that Section 1231 of the Code itself, forbids the Commissioner from requiring them to accumulate the cost of raising breeders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.831" offset="5854647">They argued that Section 1231 was intended to give ranchers capital gain treatment on the full proceeds from the sale of breeding animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.524" offset="5897488">We submit that the clear language of that section shows that it grants preferential capital gain treatment only to the “gains” recognized from the sale of breeding livestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.299" offset="5948583">The word ‘gain' is defined in the -- elsewhere in the Code, as the excess of the sales proceeds over the accumulated or other cost basis of the animal -- or of the asset sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.313" offset="6000619">The full sales proceeds would thus constitute the gain, that is the capital gain, only if the ranchers were right, respondents were right, that they didn't have to accumulate the costs of raising the animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.430" offset="6057044">Thus, their argument with regard to the meaning of Section 1231, leads into the question of what do the regulations require and what did Congress understand the regulations to require when it enacted 1231.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.028" offset="6111483">Their next argument is that even that if it would be consistent with 1231 to require them to accumulate the basis of breeding animals, the regulations do not in effect -- do not in fact require them to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.250" offset="6180342">They concede that with respect to most industries, that general principles of the Code enunciated in Sections 263, 471 and certain other sections cited specially in our reply brief, require taxpayers to accumulate the costs of manufacturing creating or constructing assets, and that this applies to both inventory assets and capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.573" offset="6293713">They concede that this principle applies to require them to accumulate the cost of raising their beef animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.628" offset="6321925">However, they say, the Commissioner has relaxed this requirement with regard to their breeding animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.512" offset="6349406">As I explained earlier, it is our position the Commissioner relaxed this requirement only with regard to the cash method taxpayer where it makes sense to relax the requirement in order, solely in order, to give the cash-method rancher and farmer a simplified method of accounting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1763.651" offset="7157948">And in -- I would like now to turn directly to that question and deal with the language of the regulations, which is not easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.272" offset="7200475">It's complex language and it's set out in a number of different sections which interlocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.660" offset="7218030">And if I may, I would like to state just one or two points with regard to ranch and farmer accounting before I get to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.100" offset="7251780">I'll try to make it very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.067" offset="7259617">In ranching and farming, it is particularly difficult to ascertain which expenses have been incurred with regard to which assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.513" offset="7297442">In other words, the farm hands or ranch hands, may as a group, at one time work on growing crops, on the corn crop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.966" offset="7335267">But another time, they may work on -- they may spend their time caring for the breeding animals, at another time they may spend their time caring for the beef animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.621" offset="7377899">If and -- if an accrual rancher was to apply an exact method of accounting, he would have to keep records to show what percentage of each man's time was spent on what type of animal, he would have to break down the salary and allocate it, so on with all the other expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.141" offset="7451982">The Commissioner recognized, as do respondents, that ranch and farm operators are particularly unsuited to keeping this type of detailed records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.529" offset="7497540">Therefore, early back in the 1920's, there grew up to practice, not then recognized in the regulations but subsequently specifically adopted by the regulations, which permitted accrual farmers and ranchers to use an estimated method of accounting it, estimated cost method of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.969" offset="7571205">Under this estimated method, a livestock raiser would estimate the amount it costs him to raise a cow or a steer from birth to one year old, from one year old to two-year old, to three years old, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.912" offset="7642990">He would then value his inventory according to those estimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.855" offset="7658768">In other words, if he estimated that it costs him $10, in salaries, feed, medical care, etcetera, to raise a cow from birth to one year old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.545" offset="7705579">And then at the end of the year, he had on hand ten one-year old cows, he would value those at $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.209" offset="7736195">That was an estimated method of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.392" offset="7748942">Then he would use -- this is called the unit-livestock price method of accounting, now that has been adopted specifically by the regulations and authorized by the regulations, and all of the respondents are on this estimated cost method of accounting as our most livestock raisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.866" offset="7806830">Now, this estimated cost method of accounting, requires a two-step procedure in order to use it on an income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.568" offset="7837654">First, the rancher takes a deduction for all of this expenses, he deducts the cost of labor, he deducts the cost feed, he deducts all of his expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.520" offset="7877465">He then adds to his income which in effect reduces the amount of the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.482" offset="7909334">He adds to the income the amount which his estimated raising costs are, with regard to the livestock still on hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.079" offset="7955728">In other words, if a taxpayer estimates that it cost him $10 a year to raise a cow, the beginning of the year let's assume for simplicity has nothing on hand, no cows on hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.896" offset="8006928">At the end of the year, he has ten one-year-old cows on hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.828" offset="8026676">So he estimates that his inventory at the end of the year cost him $100 to raise during that year, ten one-year-old at the end of the year at $10 per year raising costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.211" offset="8064188">Let's assume that during that year, he incurred a $110 worth of expenses for labor, feed, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.954" offset="8095222">He takes $105 deduction on his income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.123" offset="8115911">He then adds to his income the increase in the estimated cost basis of the animals on hand, that is a hundred dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.842" offset="8150706">And it nets out to give him a deduction of $5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.932" offset="8163140">Now, if all of these expenses have been incurred in relation to raising these animals, it would show that his estimates were off a little, but that they were fairly accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.451" offset="8197204">Now, this example illustrates one very important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.904" offset="8218937">That this estimated method of accounting, which is a two-step affair, take a deduction for all your expenses then add to income, which in effect reduces the deduction by the increase in your estimated costs of cattle on hand, this estimated method does not create ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.169" offset="8288005">What it does is to offset a portion of the deduction, which was allowed by the first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.289" offset="8324577">In other words, going back to my hypothetical, the taxpayer instead of having a $105 deduction has to put a $5 deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.561" offset="8353625">Adding that $100 back to income, his increase in cattle on hand does not create a hundred dollars worth of income.</text>

            <text syncTime="2167.877" offset="8774928">And they cite that regulation throughout their brief, and it's there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.284" offset="8788511">It's there, it's in 160-12 of the regulations today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.625" offset="8801886">It's been there since the early ‘20s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.361" offset="8808782">But when the Commissioner put that regulation in, he also put in a second regulation which was intended to be read together with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.802" offset="8842533">And that regulation is the one that requires you to add that to income in effect for an accrual-method taxpayer offset a part of that deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.405" offset="8877014">That regulation that respondents tediously ignore, that's we cite it, especially in our reply brief, we set it forth extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.149" offset="8915989">Now, the second regulation, which is found in Section 61-4 of the regulations, states that with regard to a cash-method rancher, he doesn't have to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.200" offset="8956217">He doesn't have to make any adjustment on account of raising costs with regard to cattle still on hand, because he supposed to have the simplified method of accounting, he just takes the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.767" offset="9006477">However, it goes on the state, in part B of the Reg. 61-4 that with regard to an accrual-method rancher, he must add that to income, the increase in the estimated costs of raising the animals, which are still on hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.681" offset="9078053">In other words, it effectuates that two-step procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.659" offset="9098010">Take a deduction then add that to income, the estimated costs of the animal still on hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.283" offset="9128521">Now, this is true regardless of whether the animals are treated as -- let me restate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.321" offset="9164675">This is true regardless of whether the rancher has elected to include his breeding animals in his inventory or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.637" offset="9201873">This is a -- this is a method -- this is a question which we consider purely mechanical, for accounting convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.471" offset="9225279">Back in ‘20s, ranchers typically included breeding animals in their inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.047" offset="9243564">It was just a convenient way of keeping a sheet of paper to said inventory, beef animals, breeding animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.895" offset="9266970">If they don't elect to keep their breeding animals in inventory, they must nevertheless prepare a sheet of paper to his capital assets and estimate the amount, which the cost of raising these capital assets has increased and add that back to income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.827" offset="9326634">The Commissioner and the Regulations specifically says that if a rancher wishes, he can include his breeders in inventory or he may treat them as capital assets, whichever he prefers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.394" offset="9380968">In either event, he's entitled to capital gain and it makes no real difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.255" offset="9400404">It's primarily a question of convenience and mechanics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.453" offset="9421197">Now, respondents make a third argument -- the third and last argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.556" offset="9441573">Is that even if accrual-method ranchers have always been required to accumulate the cost of raising their breeding animals, nevertheless, there is -- these respondents should be excused from that requirement because they had no “meaningful choice”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.253" offset="9512417">By this, they mean, that at the time they chose the accrual method of accounting, it was not yet recognized that breeders would be entitled to capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.129" offset="9559855">Most of them made their choice, and I'll deal with the point of most of them in just a moment, before 1942, before the statute was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.024" offset="9599457">In effect, they're arguing that they bought a pig in a poke, and that they have no meaningful choice when they made their selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.106" offset="9627773">Now, there are three answers to this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.795" offset="9642506">The sure answer is that respondents have elected the more accurate accrual method of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.927" offset="9667062">It had certain advantages and certain disadvantages at the time they elected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.844" offset="9682735">There are certain advantages and certain disadvantages today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.675" offset="9698095">And they may not revoke their election, merely because it changed in the law, alters one of the advantages or disadvantages, relative advantages or disadvantages of one method of accounting in relationship to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.452" offset="9757132">As this Court's said in a similar case, Helvering versus Wilshire Oil, cited and discussed on pages 11 and 12 of our reply brief, “Tax statutes and tax regulations have never been static.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.981" offset="9807287">Experienced changing needs, changing philosophies, inevitably produce constant change in each.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.159" offset="9832051">One making an election between accounting methods takes the risk that the method of treatment of an item might be changed by Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.825" offset="9870712">In that case, this Court refused to allow the taxpayer to make a new election to give up this election between the two methods to take the other one, merely because the law was changed with regard to one of the relative advantages and disadvantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.975" offset="9931316">In this case, just as in Wilshire when respondents elected the accrual method of accounting, they took the risk that the method of taxing gain on the sale of breeding animals might be changed by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.316" offset="10080632">For example, every time Congress lowered or increased the rate of taxing ordinary income as they do frequently, it would make a difference in the relative advantages of the cash and accrual method of farm accounting, because if they raised the rates on cash -- if they raised the rates an ordinary income, it would make the cash method more attractive, vis-à-vis the accrual method of accounting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.119" offset="10447809">If -- now, what are the standards by which the Commissioner generally grants changes in elections?</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.069" offset="10471633">The standard is typically, before a taxpayer can obtain a change in an election of a method of accounting, he must show that he has a business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.013" offset="10503398">He must show that there's something more than a slight change in the relative tax advantages of various methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.805" offset="10522624">He must show that there is a business reason for making the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.848" offset="10538715">For example, if a rancher, who had an inventory of cattle, say $30,000 came and say, “I'm on the accrual method, I want to make it change to the cash method.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.932" offset="10579048">The Commissioner would as a matter of course allow to make that change because the costs of keeping the records necessary to the accrual method are disproportionate regarded the small amount of the inventory concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.139" offset="10627950">But with other taxpayers, such as the respondents here, where they have inventories of cattle of quarter million dollars or so, it would make a very, very substantial change in the -- difference in the computation of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.481" offset="10697331">The Commissioner would like to see both cash and accrual methods ranchers required to accumulate the cost of raising breeders.</text>

            <text syncTime="3100.310" offset="12504586">This case began as a conflict between two regulations of the Commissioner, Regulation 162-12 and Regulation 471-6 (f).</text>

            <text syncTime="3126.898" offset="12610957">And the conflict was this, Regulation 162-12, which was promulgated 45 years ago and is a very simple clear-cut regulation, stated that livestock raisers were permitted to deduct the cost of raising their breeding animals as a current expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.638" offset="12705938">The Secretary of the Treasury noted this in 1952, and he made a very clear statement that since the early days of income tax, livestock raisers have been permitted to deduct their raising cost of their breeding animals as a current expense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.811" offset="13130585">In 1944, Regulation 471 was promulgated and the Commissioner interpreted that regulation as saying that the cost of raising breeding animals should be capitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.851" offset="13198817">And that was exactly contrary to what is existing regulation said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.054" offset="13219610">And in the court below, he stated that Regulation 4471 said that breeding animals must be included in the inventory if a livestock farmer selected the unit livestock price benefit of valuing his other animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.854" offset="13294738">Well, by putting them in inventory, he has admitted and it follows naturally that he is capitalizing the cost of raising those breeding animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.615" offset="13333817">That's what he said in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.031" offset="13343535">Now, in his brief in this Court, his opening brief, he changed his mind and said, “That's not so, you don't have to put your raised breeding animals in inventory, 471 doesn't require that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.716" offset="13406229">No other regulation requires that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.493" offset="13417305">But 471 does require, that if you use -- elect the unit-livestock price method of valuing your animals, then you've got to capitalize the raise and cost of all your breeding animals, whether they're in inventory or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.722" offset="13482297">That was his position in his opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.409" offset="13497031">Yesterday, late afternoon, I was served a copy of his reply brief and I found that he has changed his position very materially again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.513" offset="13537468">This change is that he no longer rests his case on Regulation 471.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.197" offset="13572159">He no longer confines his contention to livestock farmers who have selected the unit-livestock price method of valuing their inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.520" offset="13613432">He says now, that all livestock farmers must capitalize the cost of raising their breeding animals, all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.292" offset="13644570">And he doesn't care whether they fall under 471 by election or voluntary election and anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.314" offset="13672678">He doesn't care what that method of valuation is whether it's that method or the farm-price method, he doesn't care whether they're on the accounting method or the cost method and he doesn't care whether animals had put in inventory or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.585" offset="13741746">Now, I regard this as a major change in his position which as I'll point out in a minute, we don't worry about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.609" offset="13785840">But I want to note the fact that up until now, up until this reply brief, the Government has premised its claim on the proposition that Section 471 is the Section they're talking about and that we are under Section 471 because we elected the unit livestock price, about the value of inventories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.572" offset="13881657">And because we are under there, first, we must put our animals, our breeders into inventory and that means we've got to capitalize our raising cost or judging by his opening brief, he said you don't have to put a meaning but he says the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.001" offset="13951352">He says, you've got capitalize the raising -- the raising costs of your breeders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.798" offset="13970578">So, he has moved out away completely from Section 471, he is no longer confining himself to farmers who elected the unit-livestock price method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.241" offset="14016345">That was the situation in the Lewis case that was the situation in the Ekberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.900" offset="14034944">Now, he's taking it across the board position, that all livestock farmers, without the qualification or limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3734.850" offset="15042748">That's what he's quarreling with, he's quarreling with the culmination of his own regulation of 45 years standing and its interaction with the will of Congress.</text>
