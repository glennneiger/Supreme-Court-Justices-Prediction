            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="21.471" offset="189210">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.878" offset="206869">This case involves a dismissal of an indictment charging willful attempts to evade and defeat personal income taxes on the -- the dismissal was on the ground of the defendant's right against compulsory self-incrimination had been violated as a result of a previously made jeopardy assessment against the same defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.639" offset="305925">On August 5, 1964, the appellee was indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.746" offset="342392">It was a six-count indictment charging violations of willful attempt to evade payment of the taxes and also to subscribing false corporate returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.208" offset="396204">A motion to dismiss was filed against indictment and the motion dismissed was grounded on three propositions that the defendant could not get a fair trial, second, the alleged he was denied right to counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, and third that he had been compelled to testify against himself in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.470" offset="541236">The facts are reasonably simple and not essentially in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.018" offset="567463">The counsel for the appellee attended conferences with the Internal Revenue Service officials in November of 1962 and again in March of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.548" offset="613543">And that both of these meetings, Internal Revenue made it clear to the counsel for appellee that they were going to recommend criminal prosecution with no question that was understood on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.227" offset="676237">And on April 9 of 1963, the jeopardy assessment against appellees known assets was issued pursuant to Section 6861 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.289" offset="724511">And on June 6 of the same year, the statutory notice of deficiencies for each of the tax years involved were issued with the usual letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.794" offset="770591">The attorneys for the appellee filed their petitions with the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.599" offset="793788">And these petitions appeared to be a normal type and they provide the appellee's name and address, et cetera, the office, “the deficiencies as claimed,” and then in each of these petitions, concluded with the allegations repeating an affirmative form of the specific assertions of error contained in the earlier paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.446" offset="909145">These were practically identical and the sample of one is set out on page 5 of our brief so that it would not be necessary to go into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.771" offset="954493">And it was the appellee's position that the filing of these petitions amounted to testimony and incriminating evidence which made it impossible to try him for criminal charges at anytime involving the same years involved.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="249.553" stopTime="818.909">
            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="249.553" offset="1101615">To file his petition in the Tax Court and that in the petition in the Tax Court, he gave up some information.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.976" offset="1135261">When we read the petitions there, the usual type of petitions, which says that the jeopardy assessment is wrong, solely it says -- it says it over and over again in their beautiful language, well that's all there is good.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.912" offset="1195029">And that I think I should mention that throughout the colloquy with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.971" offset="1219271">The judge consulaire says that he has incriminated himself in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.575" offset="1249677">Not that he will later, I'm sure he means that this will be used in trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.566" offset="1277680">However, the U.S. Attorney repeatedly made it clear that these jeopardy assessments, the petitions and nothing else were going to be used at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.859" offset="1334836">There was no question, if they weren't going to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.607" offset="1345808">There was -- it was true that they were into files, this criminal -- the U.S. Attorney's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.462" offset="1373184">And the position taken by the court below is that the -- this in and of itself was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.508" offset="1421354">We then applied to the Court's -- appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and on that motion, the case was appealed and certified here.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.878" offset="1466911">There are two points that we have involved and there are only two.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.522" offset="1485511">One is the question as to whether or not this case is properly here on certification from the Court of Appeals in the form of a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.553" offset="1529605">And I meet that one first because it's the Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.535" offset="1549563">And 18 U.S. Code 3731 provides for this direct appeal when an indictment is dismissed as a result of a motion in bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.805" offset="1602644">Now, first of all, as to whether or not this is actually what the statute says, I would like to point out that there's no question on the finality of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.224" offset="1664293">The judge did not issue an order even though he invited an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.214" offset="1692191">He started out inviting one and ended up inviting one, he didn't write an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.131" offset="1715911">But the order itself says specifically that the indictment is dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.568" offset="1745690">The bail is discharged and the defendant is released.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.375" offset="1772857">And the District Judge said specifically from the bench, “When the Government said in motion the jeopardy assessment and the 90-day letter which compelled him to come forward within a certain time and filed his petition in the Tax Court, they, the Government, foreclosed themselves from proceeding in the criminal case during that time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="446.810" offset="1890617">Now, while this phrase, “during that time” somebody might think meant temporarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.615" offset="1917785">In fact, as the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit said in this case, “If the trial court's views are correct, there is no possible way in which the defect in the indictment can be cured in this case or in any other indictment that may be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.529" offset="2001481">Secondly, there is no question that this ruling was made on the motion by the defendant based upon facts not covered by the criminal statute or the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.838" offset="2050696">It was not in any person who brought him in.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.252" offset="2064384">And the appellee's position in this regard was summarized in its assertion which was in its motion to dismiss that by virtue of the assertion of taxes, penalties and interest against the defendant, the filing of income tax, liens, and the seizure of his assets, defendant had been compelled to execute statements of fact pertaining to his income tax liabilities from the years 1958 to 1960 in pleadings required to be presented to the Tax Court of the United States and to the Internal Revenue Service, thereby, compelling this defendant to testify against himself in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the characters of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="539.216" offset="2260198">That seems to me clearly that this is within the general rule on the question of appellate jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.323" offset="2308681">I would say further that it's clearly set forth in the Court of Appeals decision in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.431" offset="2349119">The appellee here claims and indeed the District Court followed what they considered to be the law of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.899" offset="2391019">And when this case reached the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit distinguished both of the cases and held that it was no question that this case was not the type of case which they relied upon.And now as to the merits themselves, well, I think first I have to -- I just notice here we have the problem that both sides are relying on United States against Mersky which is the recent case of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.400" offset="2564995">And I would say that this case is certainly of course different.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.303" offset="2600626">But on in each of these cases -- I mean in the Mersky case, it appeared that the previous cases of Hark and Murdock and Storrs were in bar and that it was clear that the manner in which the defendant frames his pleading is not determinative of whether or not it was actually a motion in bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.329" offset="2700727">The critical factor is the effect of the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.202" offset="2720162">On the other hand, the justices of this Court came to the diverging conclusion with respect to the type of ruling which would have the requisite effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.031" offset="2771466">Justices Brennan and Justice Whitaker expressed the view that a judgment which will end of course an escapade of the defendant was sufficient to make it a motion in bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.839" offset="2822771">Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, and Mr. Justice Harlan interpreted the pertinent jurisdiction in the ground of Section 3731 as limited to the old common law “special plead in bar.”</text>
            <text syncTime="695.129" offset="2883897">And it was stated that it must be a plea in confession and avoidance which does not contest the facts of the indictment but relies on matters outside the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.097" offset="2931754">And we say that the dimis -- dismissal of this indictment by the District Court satisfies both of these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.415" offset="2969057">And whichever way this Court reads the Mersky opinion as of this case, we think it is clear that the District Court was not only in error but that we come under Section 3731 and the case is properly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.817" offset="3038647">We say that because we believe that the only reason for interpretation of the District Court ruling is that it is necessarily had the effect of permanently baring prosecution for income tax violation during that period of time from 1958 to 1961 and actually escapaded the appellee for any Internal Revenue charges during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.022" offset="3151496">And in view of the rejection of the Government's argument below and of its suggestion of an alternative remedy which is a motion to dismiss or any other kind of remedy other than to dismiss the indictment, the Court's dismissal in indictment was after it had intended to leave no means open to the Government by which indictment could be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.880" offset="3242924">And the cases relied on by appellees, there are cases of suppression of evidence, of evidence that could be produced and could make future trial possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.543" offset="3293497">In this case, the only way that this man under the decision of the District Court here, the only way the appellee could be reindicted legally under this opinion would be to turn the clock back and not file the jeopardy assessment which has already been filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.909" offset="3378970">But General, only jurisdictional point of -- as -- if we could determine that this is subject to direct appeal, is there any kind of situation in which the indictment would be dismissed before a jeopardy of taxes which is not appealable here?</text>

            <text syncTime="882.929" offset="3635075">To the contrary, one of the Ninth Circuit cases if I remember was where the Court ordered the District -- the U.S. Attorney to produce certain documents before trial and the claim was made that they couldn't find them or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.488" offset="3713337">And the District Court says, “Well, the defendant cannot try this case without those.”</text>
            <text syncTime="908.482" offset="3737266">And the indictment was dismissed and that held was held not to be a plea in bar because there was a possibility that they could eventually find them.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.735" offset="3770284">And if ever they found those papers, they could retry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.658" offset="7762004">I would like to say something about jeopardy assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.588" offset="7785723">When the jeopardy assessment is filed, levies are made against all the known assets of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.967" offset="7819264">And in the County Recorder's Office, liens are filed showing the same amounts of taxes due that are in the jeopardy assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.442" offset="7865135">Now, as stated by the Solicitor General, the Government did not take any current earnings of Ben Blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.188" offset="7896168">But it had a right to do it over attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.129" offset="7919888">Not only that but the liens that were filed attached to not only the property and existence at the time of the assessments but after acquired property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.596" offset="7969729">And if Ben Blue had no funds, and borrowed some from -- let's say his sister, the lien would attach to that if it were paid over to an attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.361" offset="8144854">It's material in this respect, as the Solicitor General stated, in the Daeche case in particular, it takes a lot of money to defend a case and we don't know how much money Ben Blue is going to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.423" offset="8205040">This much is sure the record shows that none of the money that was levied upon had been released at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.309" offset="8236596">But we are not urging at this point that Ben Blue cannot employ counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.244" offset="8264391">That is not being urged at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.296" offset="8272541">We don't know what the future will hold in that regard because we don't know how long this case is going to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.362" offset="8300857">Now, back to the jeopardy and I'm sorry I didn't stress this in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.898" offset="8323009">I alluded to it but I didn't give any figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.351" offset="8340773">In the transcript, the first thing we have is the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.592" offset="8369716">And count 1 shows -- count 1 states that Ben Blue reported on his return taxable income of $9,817.98, that he shouldn't have reported $12,649.56.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.221" offset="8476296">In other words, he had a deficiency of $2,831.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.800" offset="8498552">That's -- that's the money that he owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.178" offset="8508061">That's according to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.242" offset="8520391">Now, if you turn to page 76 of the record, you find that the jeopardy assessment was made in the amount of $12,023.18, three or four times that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.745" offset="8610356">And assets were seized to cover that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.188" offset="8624149">In addition to that, the jeopardy assessment was in $6,011.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.014" offset="8647450">Now, the indictment figures are but a small fraction of the jeopardy assessment fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.811" offset="8690604">But note also that when the statutory notices were sent out, 60 days after the jeopardy assessments were made, the Government admitted in its report that the assessment was in excess of the liability by $2,850.67 for that year and the penalty was in excess of $1,425.33.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.341" offset="8808782">Now, after the Government takes his assets, within two months, it finds that it has taken $5,000 too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.315" offset="8864684">And a year and four months later, in his indictment, it says well, we -- at this point, we can only prove $2,831 instead of $12,023.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.019" offset="8919437">I have to say, I mentioned in my brief that these amounts have been reduced but I didn't put the figures in there and I think I should have because when we take the six counts, this is what we find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.693" offset="8986102">That in the indictment it claims that he understated his tax and that of the corporation by little less than $40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.499" offset="9029360">But if you take the figures from the jeopardy assessment, which are in the transcript, the amount there is about $135,000 or about three times as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.690" offset="9078157">And as the record also shows, during this whole period in between the jeopardy assessment and the time of the indictment, none of the liens were abated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.800" offset="9130611">They stayed in the recorder's office, in the same amounts that it were -- that they had when they were originally filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.672" offset="9170108">Now, another thing there, when the jeopardy assessment was made, 50% civil penalty was assessed which was reduced admittedly because they were in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.233" offset="9224338">And there, the Government has the burden of proof on a jeopardy assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.435" offset="9245132">The point is that it shows how loose the Government is in doing these jeopardy assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.408" offset="9285047">It -- it admits in -- within 60 days that was quite long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.266" offset="9308453">And by the time he gets throughout the indictment a year or more later, that it was even worst of than it originally thought it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.155" offset="9352025">Now, with regard to the operation of the Tax Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.578" offset="9393716">Well, what I am saying is that the use of the jeopardy assessment procedures, which was intended to be purely for civil purposes, is being used in this case to compel the defendant to incriminate himself, because the same income, the same tax is involved in the Tax Court case -- in the Tax Court petitions in the Tax Court case as are in the indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.240" offset="9588381">Now, if the jeopardy assessment had been for $40,000 as the indictment fixed the amount, wouldn't he then have, under your theory, have been called upon to violate and called upon to -- called upon to testify as to that and therefore the -- in the same shape?</text>

            <text syncTime="2430.923" offset="9827035">But my point in showing these figures is to show that the jeopardy assessment itself is a loose procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.264" offset="9864443">And in this case, were used apparently to set up a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.405" offset="9892968">Now, let me give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.051" offset="9903626">As you find in the record in these -- in the statutory notices that were sent out by the Government, they raised the question of depreciation on an automobile that was disallowed on the part of the Merry-Go-Round Incorporation and the use of the automobile was said to be personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.127" offset="9999862">It doesn't involve an awful lot of money compared with the whole picture but it's one of the items there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.639" offset="10021909">Alright, now the Tax Court petitions are filed a year ahead -- a year or more ahead of the -- of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.180" offset="10060048">And if the Tax Court case comes to trial first, and the Tax Court does not necessarily follow the recommendation of the Government, then I've said that in the case in my brief where the Circuit Court held that the Tax Court need not continue a case if there is a related criminal case pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.267" offset="10140400">But the Tax Court case can come to trial and he -- that the taxpayer has the burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.792" offset="11922578">Well, there's another point which I haven't mentioned and that is the discrimination element of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.104" offset="11967822">It is conceded by the Government, that it is not the usual procedure to make a jeopardy assessment when criminal prosecution is under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.893" offset="12002931">That is conceded by the Government in this brief at page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.181" offset="12028113">Now, there isn't one iota of evidence regarding the reason for the jeopardy assessment, not one bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.484" offset="12069282">The Chief of the Intelligence Division in Los Angeles was on the stand during the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.995" offset="12091329">No questions were asked to him about the reason for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.638" offset="12109928">So we have a -- we have a situation where the Government admits that it doesn't do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.391" offset="12136887">The mere fact that it doesn't indicates two, the unfairness of the procedure of having a jeopardy and then having a trial on the issues later on, on the same issues because here, there's a -- the income is the same, the tax -- and the tax is the same for both the jeopardy assessment and for the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.905" offset="12242944">The -- it seems to me that in the light of the cases that have been decided by this Court recently, and I mentioned the Griffin case, Douglas, Coppage, Draper, Gideon, the Rideout case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.252" offset="12324342">Now, you've gone beyond the matter of using evidentiary rules to give a man a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.669" offset="12370004">Here, I repeat what I said before that the jeopardy assessment procedure which is intended as a civil matter was used here to compel Ben Blue to come in and make statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.938" offset="12427160">Now, you say, well, these are just general denials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.514" offset="12445445">Every item that was in the statutory notice had been answered in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.061" offset="12471568">And it puts -- it puts the defendant in a position where he has one case in one court and if he use the material there, and a case in another court, and you don't know how that's going to come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.876" offset="12530918">And incidentally, in the criminal case, that's dealt on a bank deposit, on a bank deposit method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.807" offset="12570624">And some years back, you have the four net worth cases, Holland and Smith on -- there you laid down some rules in the use of evidence and procedures in net worth cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.089" offset="12655679">Bank deposit is a similar type of prosecution where you use indirect evidence was all circumstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.977" offset="12695280">In fact, there should be more safeguard around a bank deposit case than there are in the net worth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.823" offset="12718686">And yet here, the Government comes in and makes the defendant swear to some petitions, and then more than a year later, indicts on the same income and the same tax.</text>
