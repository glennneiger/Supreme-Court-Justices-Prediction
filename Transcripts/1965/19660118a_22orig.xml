            <text syncTime="21.125" offset="188876">Georgia like South Carolina is brought under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by virtue of the number of first instant voting in the 1964 general election rather in the number of people who are registered to vote that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.494" offset="258361">In 1964, 63% of all persons of voting age in Georgia were registered, but only 43.2% of the persons of voting age actually voted in the 1964 general election.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="55.761" offset="327429">That is correct sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.819" offset="331713">We think that's one reason that is always comparatively a lower percent of people voting in our state because 18-year olds do not tend to register and vote as much as adults.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="71.869" offset="391899">We did not have a primary of any consequence that year that I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.385" offset="409976">We had one in 1962 for governor and the voting in the primary for governor in 1962 I think was somewhat smaller than the vote into presidential election.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.988" offset="464311">I'd like to discuss one or two instances of what we conceive to be arbitrary application of the triggering mechanism of the Voting Rights Act then I will deal with Section 5 as a general proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.234" offset="521362">The effect of Section 4 is to raise a presumption of discrimination at the registration stage, but Georgia like South Carolina is brought under the Act by virtue of something that happened at the voting stage that only 80% of the registered voters in Georgia in 1964 voted Georgia would not have been brought under the 1965 Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.542" offset="626584">Therefore, we say that there's no rational connection between the fact presumed and the fact assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.565" offset="658662">Secondly, keeping in mind that the Act operates to suspend one aspect of registration because of discrimination assumed to occur at that stage, it appears that Georgia has a higher percentage of its voting age population registered than the five states of Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky and Texas, none of which are subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.060" offset="756673">Thirdly, all the 159 counties in Georgia are placed under the Act when in fact complaints of discrimination have been limited to two or three, perhaps four small counties in Southwest, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.440" offset="814143">We have had only two counties involved in voting rights suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.701" offset="831175">One county, Randolph County involved a damage suit in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.039" offset="848520">There's been no problem since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.959" offset="860223">There were two suits in Terrell County, Georgia in 19 -- one in 1958 and one in the 60's.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.461" offset="886241">And in 1964, the Attorney General of United States reported that voters were being permitted to register without difficulty in Terrell County.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="279.151" offset="1221026">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.907" offset="1231997">We point out that the Negro vote in almost of the urban counties in Georgia is the controlling force.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.540" offset="1266584">I think Georgia probably has a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.474" offset="1274316">We have 10 Negro members of the General Assembly, two in the Senate and eight in the House of Representatives and yet the effect of the Act is to place all of the counties of Georgia, all 159 counties under the Act when it is obvious that no discrimination has been practiced in Fulton, Dekalb, Muscogee, Chatham and Richmond counties in many, many years and there's no evidence of discrimination in the great majority of the other counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.974" offset="1392285">Since the Act declares that it applies in any political subdivision within a state where less than 50% of the person's of voting age voted, there's no reason why that's even though the state itself voted less than 50%, there's no reasonable reason why that same requirement was not made in the Act as a general proposition so that this Act would be applicable only to a particular political subdivisions where the necessary percentage was not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.309" offset="1517672">Four, the presumption established by Section 4 applies as Attorney General Katzenbach testified before the Senate Committee in any state where the formula has met even though no discrimination in fact existed in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.073" offset="1580680">Five, although 100% of all of the persons of voting age were actually registered in the State, therefore, conclusively rebutting any discrimination in the registration state the Act nevertheless applies if less than 50% actually voted in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.762" offset="1663436">The Act does become operative not because of state action but because of the apathy of voters in going to the polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.172" offset="1693111">Six, the Act raises a presumption of discrimination states where literacy test or in effect from percentages of citizen's voting which exceed those existing in other areas to which the Act does not apply namely Texas and the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.862" offset="1763850">Seven, the Act covers 120 counties in Georgia, every one of which voted a larger percentage of its persons of voting age than did the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.522" offset="1810453">There were 71 counties in Georgia where more than 50% of the re -- of the person's of voting age actually voted.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.494" offset="1846397">None of the larger counties other than Dekalb, I think, and this illustrates to me the arbitrariness of the presumption as applied to Georgia, there's never been any claim of any discrimination in the urban counties and yet those counties voted substantially less percentage of their people of voting age than did many rural counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.389" offset="1953917">Dekalb County is -- which has posted along is the only county of any size in Georgia which voted more than 50% of it's population in the presidential election.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.897" offset="1999997">The eighth observation that we would like to make is the fact that the Act is not even directly related to Negro voting although every Negro of voting age was registered and actually voted in the presidential election.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.471" offset="2058303">The Act would nevertheless be applicable if an insufficient number of other persons failed to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.045" offset="2092575">On the sum total of these considerations, we submit that the Voting Rights Act is left exposed as an unconstitutional effort to supersede the qualifications for voting prescribed by a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.099" offset="2148791">Congress admittedly could not pass a law, striking down these qualifications direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.176" offset="2173137">We submit that it cannot accomplish the same thing indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.068" offset="2188706">I think we need to distinguish between the types of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.065" offset="2208664">Now, under the Commerce Clause, Congress engages in a classification because it does not want the impact of a law to fall on a particular object.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.126" offset="2248892">In the Voting Rights Act, the Congress undertook to set up a classification or formula because it had to in order to make the Act constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.731" offset="2287344">It had to set up a formula which would undertake to make it applicable -- the Act applicable only to instances of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.837" offset="2327782">In the commerce type of classification, there is no Equal Protection Clause applicable to Congress and Currin versus Wallace relied upon by the Government simply holds that there's no uniformity requirement other than the Due Process Clause which imposes a very general prohibition against arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.389" offset="2409911">That is not true here because if the -- if the classification is arbitrary in this instance, it's not just simply a question of due process but it's a question of the Act having an impact in an area where Congress is not authorized to legislate as I would come to momentarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.149" offset="2485039">What the Voting Rights Act seeks to do is to deal with illegal administration by striking at the law itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.952" offset="2516177">This is not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.232" offset="2521297">This was settled we think in a case Cummings versus National Bank in 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.473" offset="2542299">In that case, the state had structured its ad valorem tax laws in such a manner as the Court found to invite discrimination by the equalizers as between varying classes of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.095" offset="2596739">Moreover, the evidence showed that the law had in fact had this effect and therefore a challenge was made to the law itself and this Court said that a law cannot be held unconstitutional because while it's interpretation is consistent with the Constitution, it is unfaithfully administered by those who are charged with it's executions.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.424" offset="2686077">We submit that it would be just as reasonable to say that because in times past some states have abused their police power that the laws finding this police power could be suspended under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.405" offset="3653966">I think there's a difference that I will attempt to point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.640" offset="3666923">I would like first to deal with the question raised by Mr. Justice Black yesterday and that is the Congress's power under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.102" offset="3704853">I'd like to deal with this by posing three hypothetical situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.474" offset="3722303">Suppose Congress should decide in 1967 that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has not worked, has not been successful, that the only way to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment is to impose severe criminal penalties, and since, suppose Congress further finds that southern juries are not inclined to convict, the only way that this can be made effective that the only way that they can enforce this amendment is by providing for trial by three judges without a jury, would that law be constitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="938.085" offset="3856781">Let's take another situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.221" offset="3865245">Suppose that in 1967, Congress should likewise conclude that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has not been affective and the only way to enforce it would be to deny every state that involved in a discrimination of its equal suffrage in the same contrary to Article V, could Congress do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="961.060" offset="3948628">Well, you may answer that by saying well that deals with inactive Congress that comes in to direct conflict with another provision of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.287" offset="3989588">Of course, our reply to that would be that so does the particular act here that Article I, Section 2 and Section 2 of the Seventeenth Amendment which is passed in the states, the right to prescribe qualifications certainly stands as a prohibition against Congress dealing with the problem and I think we can take even a stronger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.072" offset="4080703">Assume this the Congress should decide in 1967 that the only way to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment because of the difficulties in proving discrimination, the Attorney General will tell you that he has to prove a pattern and he has to prove how groups of 15 or 20 White people were treated ten prove how groups of 15 or 20 colored people were treated, compare to show that they were treated different and that is the difficult burden of proof in some instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.837" offset="4195746">Suppose Congress recognizing that concludes that the only way is to simply say that any deprivation of the right to vote for any reason will be proscribed without limiting it to discrimination based upon the race because of the inherent difficulty of proving that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.146" offset="4265023">Would that type of law to be upheld under Section 2, I don't think there's any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.299" offset="4289578">This Court held in 1876 that it could not, that is United States versus Reese.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.447" offset="4318208">The key I think to the construction of Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment is the fact that the amendment does not say that Congress can enforce it by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.410" offset="4366064">It says by appropriate legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.011" offset="4376409">Now, what is meant by appropriate?</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.562" offset="4382678">Obviously, it means something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.295" offset="4389575">It's a limiting term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.585" offset="4394695">It qualifies the word legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.745" offset="4407338">It cuts it down somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.451" offset="4422175">We think that the obvious purpose of the word appropriate was to limit Congress in Section 2 to the scope defined in Section 1 which is discrimination based on race and calls by state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.836" offset="4483720">Legislation which is not limited is not appropriate and Congress cannot make legislation appropriate simply by declaring it so worded otherwise Congress would not distort would be the final [Inaudible] of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.185" offset="4549130">This brings me to Section 5, a veto power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.679" offset="4567103">This Section declares that with regard to any state for which a determination has been made by Section 4 that no new qualification standard practice or procedure different from that existing on November 1st 1964 shall be effective to deny any person the right to vote until either first, the District Court and the District of Columbia makes a certain determination or secondly until the Attorney General fails to object to the law within a period of 60 days after it's been submitted to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.939" offset="4688102">Now, even after such an adjudication by the District Court or failure to object by the Attorney General, Section 5 declares that notwithstanding, that will not act as a bar to any federal court enjoining the use of any such new law or standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.230" offset="4757274">Before Congress, the Attorney General sought to sustain this particular section by drawing an analogy to the freezing principle involved in Louisiana versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.098" offset="4800742">But the freezing principle, Mr. Justice White, differs in this -- in these respects from what Congress has sought to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.473" offset="4830312">First, the freezing principle applies only where discrimination has been found to exist in fact by evidence in a judicial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.388" offset="4865944">Second, the freezing principle applies only in the particular political subdivision where this discrimination has been found to exist where Section 5 by the Attorney General's own admission applies to innocent and willful conduct alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.144" offset="4928951">For example in the Louisiana case, the freezing doctrine was invoked only with respect to 21 of the state's 64 countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.751" offset="4963432">Thirdly, and this is very important, the freezing principle is applicable only with respect to the victims of discrimination that is those persons who were during the period, discrimination was taking place where voting age were not disqualified because of conviction of felony or otherwise will qualify under the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.300" offset="5045561">Section 5 applies regardless of whether the persons involved, wherever the victims were even capable of being the victims of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.952" offset="5088193">Fourth, under the freezing principle, the suspension of state law automatically is ended if the state effectuates a complete re-registration under Section 5, however, even though the state conducted a complete overall re-registration of all its voters in a nondiscriminatory manner, Section 5 would still apply to remove by some court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.231" offset="5185369">Coming to the constitutionality of Section 5, we -- it would do good to observe that assuming that the triggering mechanism of Section 4 be held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.009" offset="5232389">Section 5 would likewise fall because it's dependent for it's being put into operation by Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.511" offset="5262482">But independently of that, we submit that there are two independent reasons why Section 5 cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.444" offset="5290172">The most basic premise of the federal system is that stated in United States versus Harris, every valid act of Congress must find in the Constitution somewhat for its passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.617" offset="5334894">In Slaughter-House cases, this Court recognized that we have in this nation a government of each of the states and a government of all of the states, that it is a dual sovereignty that recognizing that this type of situation that conflicts would inevitably arise between the two governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.378" offset="5409917">The Constitution provided a means whereby these conflicts could be resolved in Article III in which the federal judiciary was created, but the Congress did not say that the federal courts would be a sense of moral of all state legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.773" offset="5463521">If you were limited to cases in controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.784" offset="5479508">As stated and as delineated there faithfully in Hamilton's essay in number 78 of the federal and expounded upon by Chief Justice Marshall in Cohens versus Virginia, we think the unavoidable deduction which must be gained from this juxtaposition of dual sovereignty and the judicial power is that no state law can be made to depend upon the ascent or the consent of any federal instrumentality whether the Court or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.682" offset="5603119">Means havebeen provided both for resolving these conflicts when they come before the Court in a case of controversy but their idea of a dual sovereignty refutes the fact that the law of a state can in the first instance be made to depend upon some federal agency of proving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.171" offset="5681068">It's pointed out by General McLeod yesterday that was one of the evils against which the declaration of independence railed where it was said that “for suspending our own legislation and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us and all keepers whatsoever”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.695" offset="5747210">We submit that if the Congress can suspend the operation of a state law for five years or until some federal court approves it that it can suspend it for a 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.800" offset="5787648">The Congress can under the Fifteenth Amendment, let's assume in advance from prior misconduct that all laws thereafter enacted will be invalid, so to could it assume under the Commerce Clause that because states had in some times past, imposed illegal exactions upon interstate commerce that no state income tax or sales tax law that there have to be passed until such time as it had been approved by federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.781" offset="5891511">Secondly, aside from the power of Congress to require federal approval as a condition generally of a state law becoming effective, we think that the Act here is subject to challenge because of the peculiar nature of the federal tribunal to which this power has been invested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.086" offset="5972699">This arises because of the fact that even though the federal court in the District of Columbia makes a favorable determination, its decision is not binding and the law says “that neither the Attorney General's failure to object nor a declaratory judgment entered under this Section shall bar a subsequent action to enjoin enforcement of such qualification prerequisite standard of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.308" offset="6065591">We submit that this is in effect an effort to invest the federal court in the District of Columbia with the authority to render advisory opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.482" offset="6102371">It is early as 1792 when Congress sought to vest in the federal courts certain duties in connection with the granting of pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.596" offset="6134763">It was -- it's been recognized as stated by Circuit Court in the footnote to Hayburn's case, the Court was composed of Chief Justice Jay and Mr. Justice Cushing, “That neither the Legislative nor the Executive branches can constitutionally assign to the judiciary any duties but such as are properly judicial and to be performed in a judicial manner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.930" offset="6216161">One year later in 1793, President Washington asked this Court for an opinion or advice with respect to the construction of certain treaties and the laws arising out of the French Revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.935" offset="6268092">The Court there respectively declined to do so and since that time no principle has been no more well settled in that the federal courts in Article III do not render an advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.760" offset="6315426">In Chicago versus -- in Southern Airlines versus Waterman Steamship Corporation, this Court struck down a statute which sought to give the federal courts the duty of rendering an opinion on a matter which would not be binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.705" offset="6375194">This Court said “that would be to render an advisory opinion in its most obnoxious form” and this is precisely what we say Congress is sought to do in Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.282" offset="6417512">In the O'Donoghue case, that the Courts in the District of Columbia were held to be constitutional on Article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.889" offset="6443948">In the Glidden case, it was recognized that while these courts might also perform certain local functions under the District of Columbia Clause like state courts do in states that this was limited to functions that were local in nature not national in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.919" offset="6504030">That was referred to in the body of the decision as well as in the footnote dealing with the old Federal Radio Commission case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.981" offset="6532347">So we say that Congress cannot impose this advisory jurisdiction upon the federal courts in the District of Columbia and in footage with the Glidden case, an effort to do so results in that jurisdiction falling not in the Court losing it's Article III status.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.654" offset="7030972">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.686" offset="7051139">The position of the United States in this case can be very simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.538" offset="7070574">Section 2 with the Fifteenth Amendment gives the Congress an express power to enforce the prohibition contained in Section 1 against the denial or abridgment of voting on account of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.284" offset="7133581">We simply contend that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is appropriate legislation viewed as a whole and its operating context, it's well adapted, it operates fairly and reasonably to achieve the objective which is as explicitly within the power of Congress to achieve and indeed the provision which puts a duty on the Congress to enforce that provision of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.808" offset="7247579">In developing this position, I want first to describe the actual problem of compliance as it was presented to Congress and as it exists in fact as Congress faced and understood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.247" offset="7301392">The so-called triggers contained in Section 4 of the Act aren't mere mechanical abstractions pulled out of the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.322" offset="7333679">They can't be fairly viewed or understood in isolation from their function, in relation to other provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.774" offset="7371504">For example, to the problem of enforcement of Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment as understood by Congress, these triggers are temporary, automatic, suspension of inherently dangerous test and devices and they're coupled with the provision in Section 4 (d) which permits more detailed judicial inquiry at the request of any state or subdivision affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.713" offset="7483204">In these two sections, Section 4 should be seen as a single integrated measure for solving problems revealed by experience and demonstrated to Congress by ample testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.772" offset="7559481">So after outlining the problem which was before Congress and the relationship to the Act to the solution, if time permits, I'll take up some specific objections raised against it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.937" offset="7684138">No sir, as the references to that record appear with frequency in the briefs Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.427" offset="7714126">The problem before Congress was compounded by the three separate distinct elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.497" offset="7742339">First, literacy test and similar test and devices for determining the qualification of voters were widely used and they're being wildly and persistently used as engines of racial discrimination in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.540" offset="7818512">So Congress focused its attention first upon literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.574" offset="7838678">Secondly, despite prior legislation to enforce Section 1, Congress with ample justification concluded that the scheme of prior legislation case by case, county by county, parish by parish adjudication had proved too slow and ineffective, a remedy for continued denials on a widespread basis of the most basic of all rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.145" offset="7944944">And thirdly, there was urgent need in the national interest to secure compliance with the Fifteenth Amendment and secure compliance now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.715" offset="7987263">Turning first to tests and devices as engines of discrimination; Section 4 (c) defines test and devices as including any requirement for the persons of prerequisite for voting or registration for voting, demonstrates the ability to read, write, understand or interpret any matter, demonstrate any educational achievement or it's knowledge on any particular subject, possess good moral character or prove his qualifications by the voucher of registered voters or members of any other class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.050" offset="8120592">In so defining test and devices, Congress used experience before it to strike at those forms of qualification, most inherently capable of abuse and where in fact there was evidence that they had been repeatedly abused in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2024.818" offset="8203661">I understood from the argument yesterday that there was no such evidence in the current contemporary Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.829" offset="8235739">There was no such evidence with respect to current contemporary Virginia Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.176" offset="8257055">The point that I am making here is that these tests so defined, had in fact been used as engines of racial discrimination in various states and counties where suits had been brought, where the observation of objective observers had noted them and they had been used and used repeatedly on a widespread basis in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.859" offset="8343782">Now, in fashioning the particular trigger in this instance, we contend that the Congress was capable and had the power to include on a temporary suspension basis, areas where it believed there was an inherent danger, the possibility that these tests were being abused, and it did not require to have evidence in front of it that they were in fact being abused at this particular moment in the State of Virginia or in the State of South Carolina or in any of the particular counties or in the State of Alaska that were covered by the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.557" offset="8514623">The trigger was based upon the fact, I hope to demonstrate in this argument that these tests were inherently dangerous that they had in fact on many instances been used for purposes of racial discrimination and that the existing remedies of the law were inadequate and that for those reasons in those areas where Congress believed they had been so used or there was a danger that they would be so used, they could temporarily suspend them awaiting a more refined judicial inquiry as to whether or not in fact in those areas they were being abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.373" offset="8657878">The Congress provided that if in fact they were not being abused and had not recently been abused then the proceeding was set up so that the state could escape from the coverage of Section 4.</text>

            <text syncTime="2196.096" offset="8888801">I think the reason that they did not was that that raises more difficult questions as to the reasonableness of the legislation and it's propriety because it was clear to Congress that in at least some states, there was very little possibility of these being abused in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment and I think the question raises the difficult point, can Congress abolish or even suspend tests in areas of the country where to make the case most clear, there are no Negroes?</text>

            <text syncTime="4350.446" offset="17506179">They then looked at the other evidence before them, they looked at the number particularly, the number of people voted in that election that was hotly contested and hotly contested in these areas in 1964 and felt that some inference could be drawn from the fact that these states were way below the national average I their voting turnout.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.305" offset="17617565">Now, it can be said that -- it's been said that there's no relationship between voting and registration because it's an obvious relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="4394.646" offset="17682975">Not satisfied with this alone, Congress examined who would be covered by this trigger and what did they find when they examined it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.225" offset="17725294">What they found was that in these states that six of the seven states covered had a history of racial discrimination coming into the recent test with respect to other matters other than voting.</text>

            <text syncTime="4812.884" offset="19355961">It was one of the considerations which Congress obviously had on it's mind and I raise it for that reason, but this legislation is not based on the -- it's based on the Fifteenth Amendment and it was suggested by several that if it hit somewhat unequally as far as literacy was concerned that prior violations of the Fourteenth Amendment shouldn't now frustrate Congress in enacting under the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.738" offset="19459302">I don't think it's necessary to come to in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.402" offset="19509979">Now the common thread and the point that I want to give the most emphasis to is the actual abuse of these tests and devices and their inherent possibility of abuse and the fact that Congress had before it great evidence, many of these areas although not all of them that in fact it had been abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.906" offset="19595975">In addition, the Congress had before it evidence that many of these tests and devices had their frank and candid inception with respect to a desire to discriminate against Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.360" offset="19681865">They had been designed for that explicit purpose while in some states this went back many years, in other states for example in Louisiana record this Court is familiar with that same purpose was being stated by legislators in the 1960s.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.914" offset="19764099">We have brought over some 70 cases involving tests and devices of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.719" offset="19791266">32 of which have come to final judgment and in all 32 a pattern of discrimination was found and we've been upheld either by the District Court or the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.756" offset="19835465">And this Court is familiar with the problem, Schnell against Davis, United States against Thomas, and Alabama against United States, Louisiana against United States, United States against Mississippi, all cases before this Court have been testing the fact that the sorts of tests and devices outlaw suspended in statute before us have been grossly abused in their administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.547" offset="19946538">And the same facts have been found by others presented to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.807" offset="19967645">I could quote as we do in our brief from Professor Keith who says flatly that the Southern literacy test was a fraud and nothing more and there were testimony before Congress that frequently that the test was applied to Negroes only, they're not fairly not applied to Whites at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.518" offset="20074433">We go in at some length to the history of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.531" offset="20094495">The history of purpose, the fact is that you had a history that's been before this Court time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.584" offset="20130753">You start it with your older clauses, your fighting Grandfather Clauses, that kind of thing in order to keep Negroes from the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.621" offset="20174848">You went from there into such things as the -- the White primer, those issues came before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.078" offset="20232735">The Congress acted in an attempt to deal with this problem in 1957, 1960, and 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.069" offset="20256664">The point is that here is the Fifteenth Amendment on the books for 95 years and a long history of devices which opened up the opportunities to bad motivated registrars to abuse them back in many instances where the legislation history indicates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.525" offset="20342450">Indeed, if you look to the good moral character test, they were used primarily as an exemption for many literacy requirement saying well, if the person wasn't literate but the registrar found him to be of good moral character, he could register anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.178" offset="20453104">An application that was made to White citizens much frequently than it was to Negro citizens and still another form of exemption clearly had a racial purpose in it's origin was the $300 property qualification which is in the South Carolina statute a qualification which to say the very least that there's literal relationship to the kind of issues discussed as to the need for literate voters but there's a significant relationship to race in the state such as South Carolina where the incidence of poverty is so much greater among the Negroes than it is among the Whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.128" offset="20624886">Indeed, the same kind of literacy test prescribed by South Carolina was reviewed by this Court, United States against Alabama and this Court affirmed a judgment that such a test had been used as an engine of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.272" offset="20685490">Now, the District Court with that opinion vividly described how the Alabama test which is identical with this had been manipulated thus demonstrating at least the potential in the statute that it could be used as they had in fact been used in Alabama as an engine for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.813" offset="20767619">And indeed, the Congress had before it an existing fact, the Court decisions which have demonstrated the fact that these tests and devices were not given to Whites at all in Clarke, Forrest, Georgia, Panola, Sunflower, Tallahatchie, and Walthall counties in Mississippi and Macon, Sumter counties in Alabama, Jackson, Plaquemines Parish in Louisiana and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.052" offset="20868556">And so there was some justification for the Senate in concluding as it did in its report when it said and I quote “in suspending the use of tests and devices, Congress would be applying to Negroes the ‘law' applied to Whites”, and the word law there is ending in a quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5215.446" offset="20966149">Was that record first which was before Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.082" offset="20980673">Secondly, the Congress had before it failure prior records to obtain compliance with the Fifteenth Amendment to a recourse to judicial relief found that those are proved genetically.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.567" offset="21042636">Now, our constitutional system rests on the proposition that when a valid law is enacted and when the constitution is amended or already exists, the state and local officials in good faith comply with federal law in supremacy with the provisions of the Constitution which they've taken oath -- taken an oath to uphold, but unfortunately in matters of high emotional content such as race relations, this hasn't always been the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.148" offset="21180980">And so, a remedy that says and in fact in our federal system sometimes rarely a person will not act as he's meant to act, an officer of the law or state official, such an instance you can go to Court and that works as long as those are exceptional circumstances and as long as its good faith compliance and it simply hasn't work in the voting field.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.851" offset="21291844">Beyond that, Fifteenth Amendment doesn't speak just to the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.823" offset="21311697">The Fifteenth Amendment speaks to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.111" offset="21328833">It imposes obligations directly upon them to secure compliance with the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.055" offset="21368644">There's been no such record in many states and indeed the contrary is too often been the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.572" offset="21402708">We have found in many of our lawsuits not that the state was in there and anxious to cure a situation clearly in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment but it was in there making motions and defending on narrow and technical grounds what had been going on and making no effort to cure it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.124" offset="21484941">And I think that a great deal of burden was best put upon the judiciary and upon the lower courts and upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.785" offset="21519527">The Congress sought for the first time and I think it waited too long a period of time to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment that the 1957 Voting Rights Act would authorize the United States to bring suit wherever persons had been deprived, not at least equalizing to a certain extent the burden had been put on a private plaintiff who have the faith to secure his right to vote or to have it vindicated and then actually, it was always dependent to the taxpayers' expense that brought the United States in to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.092" offset="21660797">And we found quickly Congress did the violations of the Fifteenth Amendment were too widespread to make that relief adequate and the Act was amended in 1960 so as to permit the courts to deal with violations which went beyond individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.513" offset="21726417">That is to say to put in the provisions for federal registration where a pattern of practice was found to exist into a point where we believe to register eligible voters whenever the government was able to demonstrate that pattern of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.706" offset="21787230">It also provided absolute right on the part of the federal government to examine voting records despite the fact that this remedy was in many respects unique, despite vigorous efforts by the Department of Justice that again can only be concluded to be a failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.472" offset="21870299">The record before Congress complete with testimony and concrete individuals of resistance to its enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.473" offset="21906244">Even such relatively clear rights is that to examine voter records were resisted by state and local officials who insisted upon making every motion and every argument possible under the law and I recall in one case we took over four years simply to secure the voter records.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.431" offset="21990149">And Mississippi, the State of Mississippi two weeks before the enactment of the 1960 Act repealed its state law which made the destruction of voter records unlawful so that registrars would be free to destroy records.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.167" offset="22073114">Furthermore, the problems the counsel this morning conceded of proving a pattern or practice are formidable problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.719" offset="22111253">Again those were illustrated by a testimony before Congress, thousands upon thousands of man-hours spent in the examination of records alone, 10,000 man-hours, 12,000 man-hours simply to examine voting records to see a pattern or practice of discrimination can be found from those records because it's extremely difficult to get the testimony of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.805" offset="22223579">One can get the testimony often of Negro citizens deprived.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.869" offset="22239880">It's extremely difficult to get the testimony of White citizens who haven't taken a literacy test or who had been helped by the registrar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.643" offset="22282930">Occasionally, this comes out, one can see it in the records, case of occupation forms in one area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.689" offset="22315112">We did note a coincidence of some 11,000 forms -- 1100 forms that's made out with the same handwriting, all White, so that each case was vigorously fought and enforced at every level through the courts and the average time in securing relief and relief which often wasn't adequate relief exceeded two years not including the year or so that was necessary to determine whether or not you had the facts on which to base a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.939" offset="22448128">I don't quarrel with the resort to the judicial process, but the point before Congress was whether or not delays taken in this way whether or not taken in good faith, the result was delay and delay and delay and delay in securing this right and Congress was very conscious of that realizing that every election that went by where a person was wrongfully given the right to vote -- denied the right to vote was irretrievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.755" offset="22571426">While I've heard discussion of distinguished counsel on the other side about the delusion of the vote of literates and those who have $300 with people who can't meet that, let me suggest to this Court that there's another delusion in here because every single person who was wrongfully denied his right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment dilutes the vote of every single other person who would have voted in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.892" offset="22687932">The argument cuts in two ways with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.518" offset="22722518">So it was the conclusion of Congress that county by county, parish by parish lawsuit was simply inadequate to deal with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.285" offset="22761493">And after statewide action in this Court is familiar with them were inadequate for the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.843" offset="22795766">State legislature was acting to frustrate the will of Congress enacted two tests and devices in Mississippi, in Louisiana had elsewhere and that bears upon the reason for Section 5 in this legislation and attempts to set aside these efforts were meant with procedural points which require the United States to come to this Court for resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.683" offset="22887090">In the case of United States against Mississippi, a process involving 36 months from the filing of the complaint without even hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.712" offset="22947276">The Congress said before it and the facts to test almost countless illustrations of frustrations, delay and the adequacy of the remedy under existing law to deal with these hardcore areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.405" offset="23005999">The most dramatic example because of the circumstances surrounding the 1965 Act was the litigation in Dallas County which was testified to at length by the Attorney General and it appears in the Senate hearings at page 10 and 12 and it gives any capsule kinds of frustrations in vindicating of right which we were faced with, but that's not a unique example.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.248" offset="23101398">Somehow Alabama was not a unique example.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.594" offset="23114773">The plain fact was that adequate remedies simply could not be achieved by the process of lawsuit within any reasonable period of time in the foreseeable future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5767.239" offset="23173392">So the sort of delay that was illustrated by experience under the 1957 and 1960 Acts made it clear to Congress that some more effective system of enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.529" offset="23234518">So it was faced with a problem of devising legislation which recognized both the importance of achieving the right to vote and of enumerating the grievances and the loss of confidence in the political institutions of the United States and especially in the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.012" offset="23332425">Congress went and enacted this legislation not enacting it because of my distinguished colleagues suggest because of pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.358" offset="23369832">Congress had before it in 1965 a crisis situation in the sense of a simply a loss of confidence in the political institutions of this country to deal with that problem, to deal with enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5834.700" offset="23443184">And it was for that reason and it's that reason why it was so important that Congress had enacted this piece of legislation that could secure for it compliance now before the disillusionment with the whole process of democratic government and the supremacy of the rule of laws set in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5856.446" offset="23530224">And so as those three facts, public sentiment not only among Negroes, but among others, among all citizens outraged at incapacity to deal with this problem against that factual record of the use and abuse of these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="5874.262" offset="23601486">And the whole nation looked to Congress to find the workable solution, a solution which would both establish the integrity and viability of the Fifteenth Amendment and even more importantly as I suggested the integrity of the viability of our basic democratic political institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="5906.442" offset="23730113">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.821" offset="23755713">I attempted this morning to describe the situation that Congress faced it and so on and faced with those three elements, literacy test, record of the abuse of literacy test, massive scale in some areas and with the need for finding an effective and efficient solution which the Congress had failed to find prior legislation as to the process of litigation that crafted this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5950.877" offset="23907955">And I think it's worth the point of emphasis that in doing so -- well, as I said in answer to a question by Mr. Justice Fortas while the Act covers discrimination in voting anywhere this was a particular problem which it focused upon in view of the record in front of it in the history of past abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.846" offset="23999801">And in that sense, as it treated literacy test differently or at least by a different method of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5983.570" offset="24038672">And so it determined to have provided for the suspension of tests or devices coupled with a potential appointment of federal examiners in those places where in the judgment of Congress, the danger of racial discrimination in voting rights was greatest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.445" offset="24118188">Faced with the need for immediate and effective action, it provided for the initial use of semi-automatic objective criteria, so-called triggers, which incorporated the information immediately available to Congress to determine where those tests had in fact been abused indicated by prior litigation and decisions of courts or where in the judgment of Congress the danger of the abuse was greatest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.091" offset="24264788">Congress recognized as I said earlier that given more time, a refined judicial inquiry could lead to different conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.142" offset="24312957">Therefore, it preserved the power of the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief under prior voting acts and in fact strengthened that power somewhat in Section 3 and for areas outside the so-called trigger that it authorized any state within the standards to sue for the purpose of demonstrating that in truth and in fact tests and devices were not being and had not in the immediate past been used as engines of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.300" offset="24453601">Thus, the triggers govern only for a relatively short period of time in which the goal of compliance for the Fifteenth Amendment without delay, required action simply on the basis of the best available information pending a full investigation, pending a full hearing on the actualities of your use for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.805" offset="24559658">After that, judicial decision replaces the triggers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.231" offset="24589333">Now there would seem to be only two possible objections to this approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="6126.954" offset="24612216">The first is that Congress has no broad authority to enact legislation under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment to deal with the substantive evil, but that that section can be used only to provide procedural remedies, including criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.626" offset="24682851">And the second would be that the machinery established by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 lacks any reasonable relationship to its objective and in that sense is not appropriate legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6322.816" offset="25395681">But it's merely a method of describing the -- who is permitted to vote in federal elections and simply assumes as indeed all other parts of the Constitution assume that the -- that the power is not given expressly to the federal government or reserved for the states and I think it is no different situation than any other rights reserved to the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="6393.715" offset="25679266">And I think under that section Mr. Justice Black Congress has the power not merely to guard against past violations but to guard against the possibility of future violations wherever that's a reasonable judgment and assessment to make, to eliminate tempting opportunities which have in fact on the basis of experience whether it's in that state or another state, it's been widely abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="6419.690" offset="25783129">It seems to me that the interpretation given by Section 2 of -- by the plaintiffs in this action is contrary to the interpretation of this Court to other similar express powers contrary to the history of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and contrary to judicial precedent in this Court with respect to the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6441.524" offset="25870482">Now, a general principle constitutional law is that the breathe for legislative discretion is still as it was and as expressed by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch against Maryland that they can be legitimate let it be within the scope of the Constitution and all means which are appropriate which are plainly to that end and which are not prohibited that it consists through letter and spirit of the Constitution are constitutional that this rule is equally applicable to the amendments of the Constitution, that's certainly demonstrated by Everard's Breweries against Day where this Court stated that the Congress is not limited to such measures as are indispensably necessary to give effect to it's express power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.632" offset="26066923">The history of the adoption both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments supports in our judgment the view that the enforcement section was intended to be treated in exactly the same way as other affirmative powers of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.055" offset="26132647">That is to say appropriate legislation was legislation which was necessary and proper to carry out Section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.163" offset="26169010">That was recognized by this Court in ex parte Virginia where speaking of the -- all the post war, Civil War Amendments, this Court said, whatever legislation is appropriate that is adopted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view, whatever it tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions they contain and to secure all persons the enjoyment perfect equality of civil rights and equal protection of the law against state denial or invasions if not prohibits it is brought within the domain of congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6555.226" offset="26325326">In that same decision, this Court pointed out explicitly that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments derived much of their force from their enforcement provisions which enlarge the power of Congress to achieve the -- end sought by the prohibitions themselves of the first section.</text>

            <text syncTime="6671.541" offset="26790515">There were those who foresaw the future at that time and thought that the test ought to be banned by Section 1 itself to put into the Constitution and banned in that way and their view didn't prevail and the great bulk of the debates is to whether or not the Congress should in Section 1 banned off such devices because they realized even then that these would be capable of discriminatory application.</text>
            <text syncTime="6700.628" offset="26906917">But I don't think that it follows and I don't think that there's anything in the debates that indicated that Section 2 therefore left the Congress powerless to deal with those tests.</text>

            <text syncTime="6917.884" offset="27775958">Their fear was not a constitutional fear, their fear was simply that that if it were not done future Congresses would not take full advantage of Section 2, and indeed I might say history bears them out to a considerable extent because there has been precious little with respect to Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment despite it's widespread noncompliance and violation over the years to first small steps in 1957 and then followed by this legislation in 1965.</text>

            <text syncTime="7021.558" offset="28190678">And this Court at that time stated and it's one of the basis for this piece of legislation that the lower court had the power and duty to render a decree which will so far as possible eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in the future and it approved the decree entered by the District Court which enjoined the future use of the Louisiana interpretation test, and also enjoined in 21 parishes of adoption of the new citizenship test which had been passed for a previous use of the interpretation test that greatly reduced the proportion of Negroes registered to vote at least until such time that there would be a complete re-registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="7066.939" offset="28372177">And our proposition that is simply stated is that such power exists in the federal judiciary to enforce the mandate of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7074.540" offset="28402584">It likewise exists in the Congress under the specific authority of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="7081.236" offset="28429333">In fact, Congress does not only like that even a broader power and that's clear from a number of decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7089.448" offset="28462143">It has established principle of constitutional law; we believe that Congress may exercise its expressed powers to deal potential evils at least where the restriction is reasonably related to the danger to be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="7103.722" offset="28519299">This Court expressly said in North American against SEC, the evils disclose themselves which entitled Congress to legislate as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="7113.350" offset="28557751">The Congress has the power to legislate generally unlimited by the proof of existence of the evils in each particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7123.202" offset="28597248">Now clearly, Congress didn't lack the problem or the power to meet the problem as it did and I think the other question would be whether or not that formula which we've discussed is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7136.714" offset="28651269">And to a certain extent, I've already discussed this in response to questions I like -- just briefly to review why we think the test itself is reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="7148.904" offset="28699961">The problem the Congress was facing was the abuse of literacy test as a particular part of a larger problem of discrimination in voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="7160.234" offset="28745310">Its attention was focused upon that abuse and it therefore directed its attention in the first instance to those states which maintain test or devices of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="7174.150" offset="28801003">It's concentrated upon those 21 states and from the facts as they exist as they were presented to Congress, the mere presence of such laws gives light to the inference that they could be used as engines of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="7197.331" offset="28893686">But Congress didn't rest on that inference alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="7200.775" offset="28907478">It sought by other criteria to refine its judgment and one such test clearly is how many people are participating in the political process and it took as a criteria for that participation in a hotly contested election particularly hotly contested election in the states involved here and concluded that where the number of people going out to vote was significantly less than the national average, 50% as against some 62% on the national average and if you eliminate these states or you contrast them, it's about an average of 43 as against an average of about 66%.</text>
            <text syncTime="7245.754" offset="29087410">It's a big gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="7247.952" offset="29096187">That one inference that could be drawn would be that qualified citizens were being denied the right to vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="8682.665" offset="34835080">In my judgment, Section 5 as it was discussed here in the view of the Government, if it's legitimate for Congress to suspend the operation of tests and devices under Section 4, those which presently exist than it would seem to me to follow from that, that Congress could take any such similar laws or laws affecting the same situation and suspend those absence on form of judicial or executive approval, executive approval which resort to the judiciary or judicial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="8714.341" offset="34961721">I think it's particularly true if you look to the history of the efforts in some states as soon as you deal with an existing law to enact a new law which makes it more difficult to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="8726.265" offset="35009473">I think to say that Congress has one power without the other is to deny that they really have a power to enforce the scheme under the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8737.263" offset="35053464">I think the procedures that require people to come in to the District of Columbia states subdivisions are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="8743.019" offset="35076451">They have judicial precedent for requiring people to come in not merely the Emergency Court of Appeals, but until very recently it was the common practice in suits against government officers and agencies which for reasons venue always had to be filed in the District of Columbia so that it seems to me that there's nothing particularly unusual or horrendous in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="8765.395" offset="35165999">There has been discussions saying about a hundred mile subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="8768.673" offset="35179060">I call the Court's attention to the fact that subpoena power apart from the facts you're dealing here with state officials and one might think would testify freely the subpoena power can run beyond the 100 miles with the -- with the approval of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8783.502" offset="35238410">As far as the proof, non-discrimination is concerned, there's a testimony in the record for Congress that really this isn't a difficult proof because what happens is you simply come in, you get testimony or depositions, state officials saying there have been no complaints, no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="8801.725" offset="35311344">And then incumbent upon the Attorney General to go back in and show that there has been voting discrimination and to produce that evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="9218.141" offset="36976912">Massachusetts -- I might go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="9221.870" offset="36991854">Massachusetts is directly and vitally concerned with ending the denial everywhere in the nation of the constitutional rights of Negro citizens of the United States and what I perhaps would like to emphasize is the interest that Massachusetts has in saying that the rights under the Fifteenth Amendment throughout the nation are enforced and a much greater interest perhaps that we have in this that in the question of literacy test as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="9250.291" offset="37105539">I might say that even in my state there is considerable question now as to the continuation of the Massachusetts literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="9259.238" offset="37141379">The day as long since vanished that if it ever existed when systematic denial of rights under the Fifteenth Amendment in one or more states could be regarded mainly as a local phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="9269.952" offset="37184219">Let me outline a few of the reasons why this appears to be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="9275.660" offset="37206998">Last August, I was sent by the Attorney General to Springfield, Massachusetts where incidents which had occurred which we feared might lead to racial disturbances of the type that have occurred in many Northern and Western cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="9290.612" offset="37266871">Fortunately, the immediate trouble in Springfield subsided, but my point is that Springfield, Massachusetts like Boston, like New Bedford, like Cambridge, like other Massachusetts cities and areas has a steadily growing, very large Negro population.</text>
            <text syncTime="9306.836" offset="37331759">Between 1950 and 1960, the total Negro population of Massachusetts grew by approximately 50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="9314.668" offset="37363106">Of these inquiries, we estimate that almost 50% or 25,000 came from outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="9321.359" offset="37389855">In many cases, these new citizens came from the Southern states.</text>
            <text syncTime="9327.049" offset="37412634">Is it not plain that Massachusetts is deeply and vitally concerned by the attitudes and the backgrounds that these new residents bring to our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="9336.915" offset="37452027">We want them to be law abiding to participate as good citizens in our electoral process and yet one wonders what attitudes a man or a woman is going to bring into a state where he has been the victim of systematic discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="9354.391" offset="37521930">A man or a woman who has been systematically deprived of his constitutional rights in one state can hardly be blamed if he or she is apathetic or defiant or suspicious or even hostile towards the law and towards organized society in the new state to which he is moved, and increasingly, as I say Massachusetts and the Northern and the Western states are becoming the homes of citizens who are born in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="9381.147" offset="37629032">I don't say this is a kind of a cheap and easy way to shift responsibility from our own shoulders to those of our southern sister states.</text>
            <text syncTime="9391.155" offset="37669052">We have our problems in Massachusetts and we are certainly learning that the condition that the problems that we have and the forms of discrimination that we may have in some of our states maybe just as persistent and just as difficult as those in the southern states.</text>
            <text syncTime="9408.068" offset="37736657">But at least a legalized discrimination does not exist, and while eliminating the growth reforms of legalized discrimination throughout our nation won't solve all the problems it is certainly obvious that there can be no final solution so long as the law, the courts and the authorities in some portions of our country actually support and encourage discriminatory practices in violation of the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="9434.119" offset="37840833">This is a matter of concern to all of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="9439.207" offset="37861209">Basically, what I'm saying is that we are one nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9442.717" offset="37875315">The truth is that the problem of creating the conditions of just and equitable relationships between the races is a national problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="9450.460" offset="37906244">It's not a problem that belongs to the one or the other of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="9455.905" offset="37927978">In our mobile society and an agent mass communications as well as mass travel, a state cannot discriminate and expect the resultant attitudes that feelings and resentments and consequences to stop at that states own borders and not to be a matter of concern to other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="9475.711" offset="38007286">I will just mention one or two other points before concluding on this matter, but certainly we're concerned in Massachusetts not only with Negro citizens who come into our State, we're concerned with the right of citizens of our State to move out of Massachusetts and would become residents of other states and to enjoy their constitutional rights in those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="9495.781" offset="38087534">Increasingly, this becomes tied into economics, to jobs as it's obvious, most -- many jobs now in private industry or in the government involve travel, involve residence elsewhere and Massachusetts Negro citizens may it be in Georgia or Mississippi or in Illinois or California one or two years from now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="9634.618" offset="38642897">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9638.687" offset="38659093">I should concentrate my argument upon our submission that provisions of the Voting Rights Act, requiring the suspension under certain circumstances of literacy tests and other tests and devices defined in Section 4 (b) are valid exercise of the power conferred on the Congress by Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, to enact appropriate legislation for the enforcement of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="9666.332" offset="38769748">Initially, we rest upon five propositions that seem to us to sustain the great bulk of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="9676.243" offset="38809349">First, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is concerned with the suspension of literacy test and other tests and devices only in circumstances where they're used in the judgment of Congress, carries undue danger of racial discrimination in their application, resulting in the denial of the right to vote on grounds of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="9704.780" offset="38923557">I think there's a very important distinction here that I'd like to emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="9709.189" offset="38941111">A literacy test may bear harder on a particular race or class in either of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="9718.680" offset="38979145">It may bear harder upon Negroes, it was suggested during the consideration of the Fifteenth Amendment, because most of them are illiterate as was the case at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="9730.034" offset="39024494">It may also bear harder upon Negroes for a quite different reason that it is administered in a discriminatory fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="9739.039" offset="39060543">So that same test is not given to them as it's given to Whites or so that a test is given to them and no test is given to Whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="9747.740" offset="39095338">And it is that latter kind of discrimination with which this statute is concerned, and that kind of discrimination was never mentioned in the debates on the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9758.610" offset="39138806">It was concerned only with the lack of literacy as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="9762.612" offset="39154792">Here, we're concerned to repeat with discriminatory application on such consistent discriminatory application as I argued last year in United States against Mississippi that it really has been read in to the state law itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="9778.345" offset="39217800">Second, the authority given to Congress to enact enforcement legislation, we say, carries the power to forbid where it's necessary to do enforcement any state activities which present danger of continued violations without waiting for the wrong to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="9797.661" offset="39295018">Now, it's conceded here as I understood Mr. Robinson's argument, and quite rightly so, that Congress under other sections of this stat -- Constitution has power to deal with what it considers potential if not actual sources of evil as the Court said in one occasion or that it may enact preventive or prophylactic measures outlawing to remove tempting opportunities, a rather apt description I may say in these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="9827.533" offset="39414554">The argument is that where Congress is acting under one of the powers given in Article 1, it may regulate that here, but here it may only enforce, but that argument is contrary to our whole constitutional history as far back as Prigg against Pennsylvania before the Civil War described in the opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart said that wherever there was a right given by the Constitution then Congress had power to enact appropriate legislation to enforce it and that has been the way the Constitution has been applied consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="9863.419" offset="39558123">For example, Section 2 of the Eighteenth Amendment gives power to Congress in the same words as Section 2 of the Fifteenth to enact appropriate legislation for the enforcement of that article, and of course the Court repeatedly upheld and the lower courts repeatedly upheld regulatory measures that did more than simply deal with adjudicated violations of the statute itself, but which swept in that, broad enough to deal with the dangers of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9895.154" offset="39684974">And these things were recognized in the early cases under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9902.695" offset="39715171">Perhaps the clearest expression was that by Mr. Justice Bradley in United States against Cruikshank when he was sitting on the Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="9911.322" offset="39749653">There he used words, which flatly repudiate Mr. Robinson's distinction between enforcement and regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9919.639" offset="39782985">The method of enforcement, he said, or the legislation appropriate to that end will depend upon the character of the right to infer.</text>

            <text syncTime="9933.744" offset="39839410">There he used the very word regulation as something that could be done in enacting enforcement legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9941.464" offset="39870234">And again, in Strauder against West Virginia quoting from the earlier case of United States against Reese this Court said, “Rights and immunities created by or dependent upon the Constitution of the United States can be protected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="9958.156" offset="39937003">The fault and manner of the protection maybe such as Congress in the legitimate exercise of its legislative discretion shall provide.”</text>

            <text syncTime="10005.187" offset="40125189">And I think Mr. Justice Harlan to come back to the distinction I emphasized in connection with my first point, that there is nothing in the history here with respect to literacy test which would operate in such a way as to disqualify more Negroes than Whites that curtails the power of Congress to deal with literacy test and other tests and devices which have built into them engines of discrimination because of the way they are applied unevenly.</text>
            <text syncTime="10034.101" offset="40240755">It's just as if in Mr. Justice White's examples during the course of the argument that they had enacted a literacy test for Negroes and not for Whites or a different literacy test for Negroes and not for Whites and certainly, there's nothing in the history of the Fifteenth Amendment that suggests that that was permissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="10376.749" offset="41611348">Section 3 (b) printed on page 90 of the Government's brief, very specifically provides that when the Attorney General has brought a proceeding in any state, if the Court finds that the test or device has been used for the purpose or with the effect of violating the Fifteenth Amendment, then it shall suspend the use of test and device in such state or political subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="10404.150" offset="41720957">That's uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="10405.349" offset="41725764">It applies everywhere, but the dominant test of course even to those states or counties under Section 4 is the same one, a judicial inquiry into whether a test or device has or has not been used in such a way as to result in violations of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10430.110" offset="41824820">Now, I don't mean to suggest that there are no differences between those under 3 (b) and those under Section 4, but the dominant ultimate test in each case is the same and if there is any state represented here in the courtroom today that has not used the test or device to violate Fifteenth Amendment or whose officials have not so done, all it has to do is to go in to court and show it.</text>

            <text syncTime="10499.187" offset="42101196">There's a provision for the appointment of examiners by the Court when a finding that a test has been used to violate the Fifteenth Amendment is made, and equally, the power to appoint examiner's falls, if a state makes each case under Section 4 (a), there's no great difference in the long run in other words with respect to the way the states are treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="10527.296" offset="42213627">Now, fifth I suggest, that the propriety of suspending a test or device where there is that kind of judicial determination that has been used as an engine of racial discrimination is sustained squarely by the decisions of this Court at the Mississippi and Louisiana cases decided last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="10549.353" offset="42301816">Some of my friends attempted to distinguish the Louisiana case on the ground that that was a suspension only pending a full registration.</text>

            <text syncTime="10571.412" offset="42390006">I may say in this connection too that it seems to me that those cases implicitly sustain the power of Congress to enact legislation, dealing with perspective violation in the future because of course the only reason that equity court is concerned with violations in the past is because of what they show with respect to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="10595.996" offset="42488330">It's not a punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10597.281" offset="42493555">It's a way of dealing with the danger not the actuality, the danger of perspective violation and where did the Court's power come from those cases to issue that kind of decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="10610.897" offset="42547994">I take it that it came from Congress, from the power granted by Congress under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment as appropriate legislation because when Congress gave the courts jurisdiction to hear that kind of case under the 57th and 60 Civil Rights Act, it impliedly gave the courts the usual powers enacted the court, but the ultimate source, I suggest, with all sincerity would seem to be Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment and not some inherent power under Article III of the Constitution which is unrelated to the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10650.526" offset="42706505">If these propositions are sound, and it seems to me that they are scarcely open to serious debate, then the essential thrust of the Act is certainly constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="10663.680" offset="42759168">Now the argument really comes down to the significance given by the statute to the determinations made by the Attorney General and the Director of the Census.</text>
            <text syncTime="10674.863" offset="42803890">Under the statute, they are the measures which Congress desired to be used for determining where and when the use of a test or device carry sufficient danger of discrimination to warrant two or three consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="10694.198" offset="42881212">One consequence which it attached to those determinations was the immediate suspension of the test or device, pending full judicial inquiries and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="10707.224" offset="42933248">Second, requiring the state or county as to which the determinations have been made to establish its right to an exemption from the prohibition and only that and then third, it opened the door to the immediate appointment of examiners, but again the power that was only interim, awaiting and which would fall if the state established its right to an exemption under the judicial proceedings authorized to be brought in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="10742.357" offset="43073787">The question then comes down simply to this, whether the somewhat different consequences that Congress attached to the making of these determinations under somewhat different consequences they would have in one set of state and counties as applied to another is reasonably adopted to the prevention of violations of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="10770.555" offset="43186636">Mr. Cox, may I ask whether you consider that there's another question here in the Court actually under 4 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="10781.912" offset="43232089">The question put to the Court is whether any of such test or device has been used during the five years preceding filing of the action for the purpose of what the effect would bridge in right to vote on the grounds of race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="10800.719" offset="43307321">And I suppose that theoretically it would be possible to argue that that standard is so limited that to say whether the test or device has been used during the four years as to raise a question as to whether it does properly establish a situation within the ambit of the first sentence of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10830.884" offset="43427903">Now, I'm not suggesting that question is before us now.</text>

            <text syncTime="10864.106" offset="43560814">That it very substantially, should I say, ameliorate, soften what might otherwise seemed to be the rigor of the five-year test because it indicates that small occasional violations, things that were quickly corrected and the like are not to be regarded as of sufficient importance to require a judgment against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="10893.650" offset="43678992">And I take it the Court in reading those and then applying them would bear in mind what is the fundamental question?</text>
            <text syncTime="10901.520" offset="43710443">Has the state conduct in the past shown enough likelihood that this test will be used as an abuse in the future or to warrant it's disestablishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="10913.249" offset="43757359">Now, Congress indicated they didn't -- it had a full round with this I think that there had been enough violation and there was enough importance in securing compliance now that to require a very high degree of proof, but nevertheless the essential theory of the Act remains what I've explained and the court in interpreting this exact words would certainly take that into account.</text>

            <text syncTime="11536.097" offset="46248814">Here, Congress attempted to -- had been mitigate any evil with respect to the, perhaps, excessive broadness of the initial test by providing a way as I've said before that any state could come in and say that the conclusions we've decided would follow upon this fact don't, don't follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="11557.886" offset="46335958">And they said that any state could come forward and prove that it didn't discriminate, but second with respect to Section 5, I would just like to mention one fact that seems to me very pertinent to support the validity of Section 5, prohibiting changes in state laws and prohibiting -- putting them into effect until it has been found by the Attorney General or a court that they will have neither the purpose or effect of resulting in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="11596.173" offset="46489140">Of course many of these states, most of these states as Congress knew had gone from one device for violating the Fifteenth Amendment to another device for violating the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="11666.460" offset="46770218">As I understood the colloquy here, there is -- it's very doubtful as it is in the case in controversy about Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="11676.750" offset="46811387">We ultimately think that South Carolina has said that it wants to do -- let's put this one hour change with respect to the time the polls are open to the registration places open to effect that the Attorney General says that he doesn't deny their right to do it under the statute in the Fifteenth Amendment and therefore can they Mr. Justice, I must say that it's hard for me to see a case of controversy requiring the Court's adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="11704.765" offset="46923504">On the other hand, while my connection with these matters is now getting little remote, I must say that I think any doubts left hanging about the validity of Section 5 would be most unfortunate in terms of the securing the right guaranteed by the Fifteenth Amendment in the near future.</text>

            <text syncTime="11740.854" offset="47067805">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11746.202" offset="47089225">The briefs of California and Massachusetts and Illinois have emphasized among other things the [Inaudible] which all states have in a level and quality of political experience of the citizens of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="11760.884" offset="47147948">We are indeed a populous and mobile nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="11764.874" offset="47163935">The continuous and free movements of people within and among states throughout the entire country is characteristic of our national life.</text>
            <text syncTime="11774.554" offset="47202597">Our state, one of the original 13 has the eight fastest rate of growth among all states, and annually, we experience an influx of persons from other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="11787.489" offset="47254319">The prior political experience and the capacity for political activity and citizenship of persons coming in to our state is of vital concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="11797.919" offset="47296115">We thus have a keen interest and the outcome of this litigation and a decision of this Court which would uphold the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1965 with its promise of securing, improving and expanding the exercise of the political rights of citizens in the states where those rights have not been recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="11820.919" offset="47388066">We also consider it to be in the interest of the State of New Jersey to secure throughout the country and as many state as possible a broad and free exercise by the people of their political rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="11834.771" offset="47443446">This Court in Reynolds versus Sims, a case which gave us clause and required us to alter our previous state policy stated “no right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which as good citizens we must live.</text>
            <text syncTime="11857.049" offset="47532575">Other rights even the most basic or illusory, if the right to vote is undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="11864.427" offset="47562146">The right to vote and the exercise thereof thus indeed has a direct impact on the policies and actions of state government and on the enactment of laws by which the people are to be governed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="11877.479" offset="47614286">Our state voting laws recognized the importance of suffrage and are designed to accord the widest range, the popular exercise of the political franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="11888.348" offset="47657754">The passing interest is the fact that the first Negro to vote in the United States under the Fifteenth Amendment was Thomas Mundy Peterson who cast his vote in Perth Amboy, New Jersey on March 31st, 1870, the day after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="11905.392" offset="47725986">Consequently, we do not view with alarm or misgivings the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and assuredly, we do not concede congressional action in this area as an encroachment upon any power which we would otherwise assert or reserve to ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="11926.290" offset="47809578">The power of the State of New Jersey to prescribe voter qualifications is of course subject to the Fifteenth Amendment and to congressional enactments designed to enforce that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="11938.688" offset="47859106">In short, we concede that the policy of Congress which is reflected in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as a reflection of our own state policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="11950.056" offset="47904664">Now, another important aspect of our interest in this case involves New Jersey's participation in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="11958.986" offset="47940295">There are a great many important and substantial national programs which encompass federal assistance to state and local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="11967.794" offset="47975612">Examples come readily to mind; the economic opportunity act, area redevelopment, urban renewal and housing, mass transportation and highways, aid to education.</text>
            <text syncTime="11981.117" offset="48028902">These programs are implemented and administered on the state and local level by local government within the framework of implementing state laws and to state elective and appointive officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="11994.189" offset="48081147">If the solitary objectives of these programs are to be realized fully it is we think imperative that they'd be administered on the local level by officials truly representative of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="12008.088" offset="48136735">New Jersey's interest in the outcome of this litigation is not therefore academic.</text>
            <text syncTime="12014.185" offset="48161186">For example, New Jersey contributes approximately 4% of the total funds for federal programs of assistance to local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="12023.022" offset="48196504">It receives approximately 2% of total distributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="12027.960" offset="48216252">Now, there may indeed be a need for greater expenditures of federal moneys in other states and areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="12036.003" offset="48248435">We do not complain here of disproportions in these vital federal state programs, but we are much concerned with the manner in which the moneys of our citizens is spent and utilized within the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="12049.845" offset="48303815">We must therefore be concerned with the quality of government in the states who are our partners in federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="12058.771" offset="48339446">In sum the state of New Jersey with every other state of the union as an important state and an abiding interest in this historic litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="12070.740" offset="48387406">Now this Court has had the benefit of ample and able argument on the part of the counsel, both opponents and proponents, with respect to various facets of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="12082.395" offset="48434009">Our additional comments are not intended to be repetitious merely emphatic of points already made in support of the congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="12092.381" offset="48473924">Two elements in my opinion are crucial and point compellingly to the conclusion that the Act is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="12100.594" offset="48506734">First, there has been a failure of adequate enforcement with respect to previous voting rights legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="12107.964" offset="48536304">This Court must, as in Congress, note this history.</text>
            <text syncTime="12112.788" offset="48555530">Secondly, there is ample factual documentation to justify the novel and the decisive remedies embraced, the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="12124.846" offset="48603805">Now, the Attorney General has related the history of the implementation of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960 and 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="12138.350" offset="48657826">It was his conclusion, notwithstanding the compliment paid by Louisiana yesterday to this Court and to the Department of Justice with respect to the efficacy of judicial enforcement, that despite scrupulous, unremitting and conscientious efforts on the part of the national government to secure redress on behalf of aggrieved citizens, the previous Civil Rights Acts have proved inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="12166.449" offset="48770152">As stated by the Attorney General before the Senate Committee on the judiciary litigation on a case by case basis simply cannot do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="12177.561" offset="48814665">This history forcibly underscores not so much why Congress enacted the particular solutions envisaged by the 1965 Act, but also why it was compelled to consider new approaches the problems of racial discrimination in connection with the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="12198.853" offset="48899824">There's no need to recount the complete overwhelming factual documentation demonstrating the need for the solutions encompassed by the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="12211.971" offset="48952278">These have already been mentioned in our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="12214.327" offset="48961682">We capitulate it in the various briefs filed and recorded in the extensive volumes covering the reports and hearings of Congress and the United States Commission on Civil Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="12226.194" offset="49009121">The Act is thus, not based solely upon or borne solely of the emotions touched off by the Selma-Montgomery March in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="12237.660" offset="49054992">What cannot be over emphasized, however, are the following factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="12242.890" offset="49075994">The fact that literacy tests and other tests and devices as defined in the 1965 Act have been misused and abused for the purpose of discriminating against otherwise eligible voters on account of their being Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="12259.614" offset="49142868">The fact that in states where this discriminatory use and design of literacy test has been established, there exists articulated and effectuated policies of racial discrimination affecting other areas of life and endeavor and the fact that where there is a coincidence between the use of literacy tests and low popular participation in elections, these factors is usually correlated and thus speak of a purposeful racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="12295.195" offset="49285183">Now before considering the relevance of these foregoing factors with respect to the validity of the Voting Rights Act, it is well to fix briefly the undoubted power of Congress to enact such legislation under the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="12310.033" offset="49344533">The Act itself is denominated as an Act to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the Fifteenth Amendment has been used many times to nullify state imposed voter qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="12324.326" offset="49401689">The lower court in United States versus Louisiana were marked.</text>
            <text syncTime="12329.003" offset="49420392">There is no license for the loose statement that in our constitutional system, the qualification of voters is exclusively committed to the states and Congress has traditionally been accorded great latitude in the selection of appropriate means with respect to the Public Accommodations Act of 1964, which was the designed to achieve social objectives, but was predicated upon the Commerce Clause ordinarily thought to encompass economic problems, this Court stated in Heart of Atlanta Motel, what means are to be employed is within the sound and exclusive discretion of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="12371.475" offset="49590293">It is subject to only one caveat that the means chosen by it must be reasonably adopted to the end permitted by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="12382.557" offset="49634597">It is in this context and setting of one, the disappointing history of previous enforcement programs and two, the empirical evidence of the discriminatory purpose and effect of literacy in similar tests where suffrage qualification in states where there is a low percentage of popular involvement in elections that the suitability in a constitutional sense of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be gauged.</text>
            <text syncTime="12418.603" offset="49778792">Now, various features of this Act have been discussed both from the bench and the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="12426.772" offset="49811498">The heart of the Act, however, is its most controversial provision, Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="12433.375" offset="49837934">Now, this has been characterized as establishing a rule in the nature of a rebuttable presumption and I think that this characterization for purposes of argument is generally accepted and we think that this device is entirely appropriate and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="12453.422" offset="49918077">Now, in argument yesterday, South Carolina made the point that under the Fifteenth Amendment by virtue of Section 2, Congress enjoys only the power to enforce not to regulate the aspects brought for under Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="12470.595" offset="49986727">I think this is indeed a semantic distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="12475.345" offset="50005744">It was urged that Congress can only in effect punish for past acts, but cannot regulate with respect to future conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="12483.449" offset="50038241">Frankly, I don't see why not.</text>
            <text syncTime="12485.875" offset="50047854">Congress may do anything appropriate to assure the full exercise of the right to vote without discrimination and that vote will not be abridged by any actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="12497.858" offset="50095815">Well, Mr. Handler what if the only evidence before the Congress about discriminatory application of -- discrimination against Negroes in registration was the fact -- where there were two facts, one, that literacy test did exist in some states and two, that in the 1964 election in several states, less than 50% voted.</text>

            <text syncTime="12558.403" offset="50338022">But the facts that Congress had before was the evidence that in most of the states where the literacy tests were used and where there was a low percentage of popular involvement, there were also well-established concerted long standing policies of discrimination with respect to the use of the literacy tests as well as discrimination in other walks of life.</text>

            <text syncTime="12584.179" offset="50441153">So that the acceptability of this presumption must be viewed in light of all the evidence not just the -- not just the low vote in 1964.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_b_handler" startTime="12595.732" stopTime="12834.729">
            <label>Mr. Alan B. Handler</label>
            <text syncTime="12595.732" offset="50487338">I think it should be viewed in the context of all of the evidence, but with respect to the vote at 1964 and the reason for that date which was of some concern to Mr. Justice Brennan, I think it's important to bear in mind that the Act was designed to have immediate remedial effect as well as prospective remedial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="12618.931" offset="50580125">Now we heard a great deal yesterday for example as to how several of the states in the South affected by this legislation have already corrected the evils that they assert the Act is designed to attack and obviously, in 1964 date was utilized in order to furnish the federal government with a reasonably current situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="12643.542" offset="50678554">If the date utilized for example was 1960 or a date more remote, then perhaps there would be some real credibility to the proposition that the states had corrected the situations with which Congress was previously concerned, but the 1964 date of course is a current and I think strongly militates against the argument that from the 1964 to date that there has been such a correction of the evils that the Act should not be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="12681.351" offset="50829751">Now, the use of a presumption as a device for initiating the enforcement of the law is not unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="12689.653" offset="50862979">Section 4 (b) in effect operates like any evidentiary, rebuttable presumption by shifting the burden of coming forward with proof to the party which is most able to furnish such proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="12704.091" offset="50920761">Thus, the use of a presumption not only strikes at the inordinate difficulties encountered under previous Acts, improving cases of discrimination on the part of the federal government, but it also overcomes the problems of delay and frustration encountered in a case by case judicial enforcement approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="12726.227" offset="51009264">Now, the provisions of the Act also call for the suspensions of literacy tests and devices for some period of time and this we also conceive to be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="12737.453" offset="51054195">For one thing, in the states affected, such tests have usually been designed and applied for the intentional violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="12747.693" offset="51095155">Also in these states, there has been a policy of overt or covert obstruction with respect to the enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="12757.795" offset="51135592">Moreover, as a matter of common sense in recent judgment, it would be extreme optimism or naive take to assume that in states where there has been long enduring policies of racial discrimination that even well-disposed officials could assure the fair administration of such tests on the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="12781.991" offset="51232350">Now, something has been said about the Act being a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="12786.603" offset="51250845">A bill of attainder as I understand it is a legislative act inflicting punishment usually for past acts in such a way that the affected person is unable to avoid such punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="12799.721" offset="51303299">It might be noted that traditionally, bills of attainder have generally been applied with respect to legislation, dealing with the acts of individuals such as threatening to overthrow the government or membership in the communist party.</text>
            <text syncTime="12816.630" offset="51370904">I for one would doubt that it has any sensible application to states as such or to the area of voting rights and privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="12827.018" offset="51412490">More to the point Section 4 and Section 5 do not constitute punishment for past acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="13545.956" offset="54288259">The Attorney General's argument is premised on the fact that literacy test are some [Inaudible] of danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="13553.673" offset="54319083">Danger was the word that he used that if a state has a literacy test, there is danger that they were used in a discriminatory manner and that litigation is too slow and too cumbersome and therefore some more drastic needs should be achieved to get immediate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="13572.979" offset="54396301">But the point of fact is that the very statements made by the Attorney General of the United States here today contradict and avoid the application of the very procedure that he argues because rather than showing any danger in a number of states that are caught within the blanket indictment that's supported by this Act rather than a number of those states are admitted by their own concessions here in open court, shown to be non-existent for example in North -- in South Carolina and in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="13609.350" offset="54541751">In the complaint brought by South Carolina, it's alleged for example in paragraph 19 that South Carolina denies that the use of test or devices has been followed for the purpose or with the effect of denying the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="13623.301" offset="54597548">The answer of the Attorney General alleges insufficient knowledge of information on which to express a belief as to that allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="13632.662" offset="54635060">The testimony of Mr. Katzenbach before the Congress with respect to Virginia and with respect to South Carolina both indicated that they had a clean bill of health insofar as discriminatory action by those two states was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="13646.887" offset="54691903">As a matter of fact, South Carolina with a literacy requirement has a bigger percentage of registration in Florida and Arkansas which have no literacy requirements and about the same as the state of Texas which had no literacy requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="13663.423" offset="54758045">The absence of any discrimination is shown moreover by the testimony before the Congress with respect to the fact that although a summary simple procedure provided from a denial of registration to the extent that a special session of the Supreme Court of South Carolina will be called to pass upon and allege improper denial of registration, not one single appeal from a denial of registration has ever been taken in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="13696.174" offset="54889075">The reasons for the registrars in South Carolina as a matter of fact is not related whatsoever to any alleged discrimination in the administration of it's literacy test as shown by the testimony of the Attorney General before the Congress, the statements of the Attorney General here before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="13713.493" offset="54958352">The reasons for the registrars being in South Carolina are not related to any discrimination on the literacy requirements which as I have stated is not existent in my state.</text>
            <text syncTime="13724.059" offset="55000670">But the reasons are that the registrars was sent there simply because the books of registry, were alleged to be open on insufficient number of days during the month although they were open in general institution in accordance with the commands of the South Carolina statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="13764.844" offset="55163779">The low vote in the general election resulted number one from apathy, the failure of person to exercise the rights of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="13772.646" offset="55195021">As Mr. Robinson stated the main argument related to a number of factors including education, economic standing including even religious affiliations, but apathy is primarily the reason that there is a low vote of participation and in fact a low vote -- voter registration record in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="13792.889" offset="55276001">The fact is that South Carolina is as Mr. Justice Clark indicated one question, I will refer to this subject in one question, a one party state up until the comparatively recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="13808.191" offset="55337127">Within the last ten years, the democratic party controlled the entire voting process so that participation in general elections was negligible.</text>

            <text syncTime="13844.694" offset="55483204">1942, 23,000 persons voted in the general election, 234,000 persons voted in the primary elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="13852.309" offset="55513610">And in 1960 where the question was pointed to a moment ago, the general election vote exceeded the primary election vote, 387,000 to 304,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="13865.161" offset="55565019">The reason for that is very simple because there was only one contested statewide primary reason and it was during presidential election year when there was a considerable amount of interest expressed in that contrary to President over the past preceding generation.</text>
            <text syncTime="13883.539" offset="55638580">In 1962, 313,000 in the general election, 328,000 in the primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="13891.623" offset="55670868">Now the reason for the absence of any figures with respect to the primary election of 1964 is because there was no contested statewide election during that year.</text>

            <text syncTime="14029.455" offset="56222260">The -- if I may, I shall proceed rather briefly through these remaining points.</text>
            <text syncTime="14034.879" offset="56243890">The arbitrary nature of this imposition is shown by consideration of one fact and that is that whereas the states of California, Massachusetts, New York, come before this Court and urge this Court to say that illiterates in South Carolina should be permitted to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="14056.365" offset="56329885">In Massachusetts, my colleague expressed a very tenuous solicitude for the Negro vote there but the Negro who is illiterate in Massachusetts cannot vote whereas it is urged upon this Court to say that the Negro who is illiterate in South Carolina should be permitted to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="14074.013" offset="56400415">California has the same situation so that if an illiterate, in my state, move to California, he cannot vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="14083.226" offset="56437300">New York has a tenuous solicitude also and they urge upon this Court that the illiterate be required to -- allowed to vote without taking a literacy test, but in New York they're asking in what state was Jean Adams born?</text>
            <text syncTime="14097.987" offset="56496337">And he'll have to know the answer to that before he can be admitted to the election rows.</text>
            <text syncTime="14104.616" offset="56522877">They're asking what is the name of the captain who first raised all glory in the navy?</text>
            <text syncTime="14108.829" offset="56539700">How would you -- will the United States flag be in 1977?</text>

            <text syncTime="14146.874" offset="56691942">Well, it's possible that a test of that nature might have witted a few well-educated persons in my state, but it is required here.</text>
            <text syncTime="14161.837" offset="56751710">Another fact -- at least if I may emphasize is the names that are placed upon the books by the federal registrars remained on those books.</text>
            <text syncTime="14173.533" offset="56798521">There's no provision for subsequently discovered violation and the time to voted is ten days is not sufficient for us to discover whether or not they have in fact been convicted over disqualifying ground although in fairness the Attorney General has worked informally not compelled to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="14190.782" offset="56867485">But he has worked informally to removing some but nevertheless if a person should commit a crime in the future there's no assurance and no procedure whereby that person's name can be removed from the roll.</text>
            <text syncTime="14202.393" offset="56913983">Finally, there's one important factor that occurs and that is with respect to the challenges that maybe filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="14211.749" offset="56951390">We have filed the challenges of a number of instances although the registrars if not registered but what I am talking about in 600 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="14219.617" offset="56982841">Some of those challenges are pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="14222.180" offset="56993081">Now, we would have an opportunity to go before the federal registrar.</text>
            <text syncTime="14226.283" offset="57009486">We would go before the Civil Service Commission and then into the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="14229.605" offset="57022861">And in the determination of that, the question of whether this person is in fact a resident of South Carolina must be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="14236.863" offset="57051805">It will be determined by the Civil Service Commission initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="14240.547" offset="57066538">It will be determined ultimately by the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="14243.849" offset="57079808">Now, if they have an election tomorrow and not just the county where the registrars are, if they have an election tomorrow and one of those persons or several of them cast their ballot and they are challenged by candidate possibly at the risk of criminal prosecution by the United States but if they are challenged and if a sufficient number of those votes are challenged to I think the result of the election, the determination of who won that election in that event will rest not in the Courts of South Carolina but in the federal administrative procedures and in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="14282.018" offset="57232468">So that the same situation in a close election which is not uncommon such as arose in Wisconsin I believe where 50 votes out of a million cast separated and determined who was going to be the governor of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="14294.596" offset="57282832">Now, if sufficient number of those votes are involved in procedures such as the Attorney General institutes and the determination of who is going to be the governor of Wisconsin or who is going to be the sheriff of Dochester County or who would -- whether the advantage that maybe voted on in the past will be determined not by the courts of South Carolina but by the federal judiciary and that is not appropriate under the Constitution of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="14343.985" offset="57480317">This is unique in at least two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="14347.740" offset="57495364">First, in spite of the questions involved, both sides have come in to this Court and have done everything they could to accelerate the legal process so that a judgment can be obtained and they have cooperated with each other and with the Court in every respect in order to make our problem more simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="14379.506" offset="57622424">Then in addition to that, I should just like to say that it is unique in the sense that in response to our invitation, more than half of the states of the union have come in to this Court and have made their presentations to the Court on both sides of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="14404.373" offset="57721898">I can say that the Court is indebted to hold them and to counsel on both sides of the case for the scholarly, lawyer like manner in which presentations for and written had been made to the Court and the Court in indebted to all who have participated in the case.</text>
