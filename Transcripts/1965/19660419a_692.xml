            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 692 Pure Oil Company Petitioner, versus Pascual Suarez.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.659" offset="213974">Mr. Deutsch?</text>

            <label>Mr. Eberhard P. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="28.786" offset="218467">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.149" offset="235917">This was an action instituted by a seaman who was a resident of the northern district of Florida against the petitioner here, the respondent below, Pure Oil Company instituted under the Jones Act in the southern district of Florida in which the petitioner, Pure Oil Company does business.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.079" offset="343646">It is however an Ohio Corporation with its principal office in the northern district of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.114" offset="375829">At this point I should like briefly to trace a phase of the legislative history of the Jones Act which strangely has never been discussed in any of the decisions in this or any other cases involving anything in the nature of the issue here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.839" offset="462764">It has been stated frequently that the purpose of the Jones Act was to expand the rights of seamen and I think that is true except in the point here at issue on which the legislative history demonstrates that it was expressly and clearly intended to restrict the venue of seaman’s actions under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.759" offset="570389">That the statute in the course of its enactment was part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 and the Jones Act itself was the creature of Senator Wesley Jones of the State of Washington who proposed it to give seamen the right of action for negligent, the sort of common law right of action in federal and state courts to be governed, as it came out originally, by the provisions of a Federal Employers Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.454" offset="717197">The house objected to that latter provision insofar as venue was concerned because the Federal Employers Liability Act provides for venue in any jurisdiction in which the respondent is doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.050" offset="791594">After three or in the course of three-senate house conferences the position of the house of representatives was to accepted for the senate conferees and the statute was enacted to provide that only the Court of the residence or of the principal office of the respondent should have jurisdiction as it is called and now that has been held to mean venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.940" offset="915101">I repeat that that restrictive provision in the statute, the legislative history regarding that, has never been mentioned by any court so far as I know in this or in any of the other cases and there have been several, three at least, involving the precise point at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.304" offset="992632">It was discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.966" offset="999215">It was put in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.244" offset="1004335">It was put in application for rehearing in the Court below in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.063" offset="1019591">It was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.366" offset="1024815">It was presented and the matter was not mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.726" offset="1042265">Now until 1948 with the revision, general revision of the judicial code, the word residence was taken to mean with regard to corporate entities the state of incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.201" offset="1092211">In the overall revision of the judicial code in that year which expounded the term it was given in effect meaning to apply to any jurisdiction to any district in which the respondent did business.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.778" offset="1498467">Fourco, Fourco Glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.079" offset="1511737">Now in the overall revision of the judicial code they were inhabitant in the patent section which changed to residence that is the same statute which provided in 1391 (c) that the term residence for venue purposes should be taken as meaning let us say in an over simplification any district in which the corporation does business.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.817" offset="1634617">So that by the same statute the word inhabitant in the patent section was changed to residence and the term residence and another part of that same statute was said to mean such and such for venue purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.465" offset="1685191">Now this Court nevertheless held in that Fourco case that the general statute did not change the special venue provision with regard to patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.867" offset="1738794">The ratio decidendi of the court below, the Fifth Circuit in this case, is expressed in its postulate and I quote, that there is a shocking inconsistency in a rule of law which permits a corporation to maintain the regular establishment – a regular established place of business in the district, but allows the corporation to insist on a trial of the factual issues in the district in which it is incorporated or in which its principal office is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.955" offset="1875153">The Fourth Circuit has reached the same conclusion as the Fifth in a recent case decided just two or three months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.246" offset="1912351">In United Fruit case they reversed the District Court and they held much to the same of fact that there would be that that principle for which I stand here at the time at this moment would be obviously unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.321" offset="1988629">Now, we submit that that is a matter for Congress to determine and not for this Court in light of the other factors involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.896" offset="2034918">But I do say that (a) the legislative history of that provision of the Jones Act has never been mentioned, that it has a specific restrictive effect, that in calling this shockingly unfair these courts forget that for 30 years that was an unchallenged rule laid down by the Congress as a result of this legislative history, it couldn't have been so shockingly unfair and that in the Fourco case this Court held that no changes in the policy were to be presumed, then they quoted Professor Morris stating that the – as I read him and this Court apparently read it the same way that the venue provisions were not intended special venue provisions as I read it were not intended to be changed by the overall general provision of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.736" offset="2274304">In the Third Circuit, the court has specifically followed the position which we have presented that is that the Fourco case compels a holding that the general venue provision of the 1948 code does not supersede the special venue provision of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.163" offset="2356015">And we simply submit, and may it please the Court that this is a matter for the Congress to determine with regards to the questions of say forum shopping or others because in modern times briefly this does not apply simply to two or three court jurisdictions in which matters of this sort can come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.150" offset="2447966">The Pure Oil Company, the petitioner in this case so far as I know certainly for practical purposes could be sued in any state of the union and if the plaintiff in the Jones Act case saw fit under this broad construction he could go and cue them in Nebraska if he thought he could do better there than in Florida, New York or elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.131" offset="2547858">This is not – and that is true I would say if all of – let's say of all of the oil companies of the tanker companies and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.019" offset="2575444">And as Mr. Justice Fortas wrote in the Brumley and United Steel Workers case, the proper forum to which in our submission to submit a matter of this sort is the Congress and not this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.557" offset="3825560">Now in the Jones Act it merely says residence and we can understand that in 1920 in the give and take when the ship owners didn't want more liberal provision for seamen when they didn't want seamen to have a better access to the courts that there had to be some give and take and I can understand this three conferences between the Senate and the House.</text>

            <text syncTime="1022.339" offset="4192737">They certainly meant to give the remedy to the victim of an automobile accident if a Pure Oil truck as we say in our brief were to have an accident with an automobile in Miami there's no question Pure Oil could be sued in Miami under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.415" offset="4244982">Now I don't think that the Congress and the Fifth Circuit below and the Fourth Circuit both agreed on this point that Congress intended that the seamen should have 1924 less rights than those victims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.213" offset="4380191">Well Congress didn't mention any type of lawsuit in the revision of 1391, Section 1391.</text>

          <turn speaker="arthur_roth" startTime="1470.952" stopTime="1696.553">
            <label>Mr. Arthur Roth</label>
            <text syncTime="1470.952" offset="5987140">I think the Fourco case as all of the tax writers have stated and as the two decisions below that is the Fourth Circuit in the Fanning case that came out just a couple of months ago and below, that the Fourco case applies solely to the patent statute because of the very peculiar issues involved in patent violations and patent trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.394" offset="6120991">So I think Professor Moore pointed it out, I believe Barron &amp; Holtzoff pointed out that that's what it implies to and the Michigan Law Review article which is cited by both the courts below the Fourth and the Fifth Circuits point out that even in that and at the Fourco case is severely criticized because it doesn't take into account the remedial purpose of the 1948 revision of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.106" offset="6235826">Although I believe that this Court in the Fourco case pointed out that the venue of provisions must be met only by residence coupled with the violation of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.006" offset="6331434">I believe that the reasons given by Judge Sobeloff below are most compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.213" offset="6356198">The opinion is quoted extensively in our brief and one more point I would like to make I believe and we urge that the residence, now if the 1948 revision of the code had any purpose, it would be as the court below stated of course to define what is residence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.151" offset="6468002">Now residence has a common law definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.236" offset="6480332">It means as to corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.246" offset="6488377">It means as to corporation the state where the corporation is – where the corporation exists where it has been incorporated, but the Congress we state came along for venue of purposes Congress has now defined the term residence in all venue statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.773" offset="6590464">The courts below have both stated the same thing that there is now a definition of residence for the purpose of venue that all common law definitions must give way to the congressional definition, statutory definition and we urge that this Court adapt that and a firm on that basis that there is now a definition of residence for venue purposes that the common law cannot supersede the statute, and if Congress once intended, if they had once intended, something else that that intention has been overridden by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.949" offset="6771127">I would further say that the argument that we must petition Congress for every little wrong, I don't think that that was the intention of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.847" offset="6818774">The judicial code revision was to take away from Congress all of these petty little matters and to leave it to the courts to apply speedy and accessible remedies to plaintiffs.</text>
