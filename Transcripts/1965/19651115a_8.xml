            <label>Mr. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="52.553" offset="313553">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.363" offset="352841">This is a direct appeal under the Expediting Act from a final judgment of the District Court dismissing the Government’s Civil Antitrust suit against Huck Manufacturing Company and Townsend Company the appellee is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.013" offset="423476">I shall recount the facts substantially stated in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.131" offset="443852">The complaint alleged that two companies had violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act by restraining trade and conspiring to monopolize the manufacture and sale of patented lock vaults which were metal fastening devices used principally in the construction of aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.615" offset="517831">More precisely, the charge was the clock, the patentee in Townsend, its licensee, had agreed that Townsend would sell patent products at the prices and on the terms and conditions fixed by Huck.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.919" offset="579062">And that Huck would issue no additional licenses under its patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.189" offset="600168">In earlier criminal proceeding, involving the same charge have been dismissed by another district judge in the conclusion of the Government's case on the ground that the facts established did not constitute violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act without evidence that what was obtained by defendants by their alleged agreements was more than a normal and reasonable reward to a patentee.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.849" offset="710719">By stipulation of the parties, the record in the criminal case was introduced into evidence as a Government's case in cheat in this civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.700" offset="750216">And on that record, the District Court granted defendant's motions to be dismissed, although, the defense has not yet put in its case, Huck and Townsend have vigorously denied and do vigorously denied the existence of the oral agreement to fix prices which the Government's proof purported to show and maintain the exclusivity of Townsend's license in which the Government's proof also purported to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.598" offset="865782">The District Court made no finding on the existing --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="193.630" offset="877902">I didn't quite hear Mr. Turner what you said about the -- what disagreement was about the exclusivity of Townsend's license?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="turner" startTime="199.704" stopTime="210.240">
            <label>Mr. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="199.704" offset="902144">Well, the Government put an evidence Mr. Justice attending to show that there was a mutual agreement between the patentee on the one hand and the licensee on the other.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="210.240" stopTime="210.645">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="210.240" offset="944358">That there should be license with nobody else.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="turner" startTime="210.645" stopTime="327.527">
            <label>Mr. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="210.645" offset="945925">Whereby that patentee would license no one else, so long as the licensee abided by the patentee's prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.742" offset="986363">Now, the District Court made no finding on the existence of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.757" offset="1014366">But on the assumption and if we read the opinion that an agreement did exist, the Court concluded and I quote here, “That upon the evidence submitted, the case at bar is in all material respects, the same and ruled by the decision in US v. General Electric.”</text>
            <text syncTime="247.040" offset="1091584">And a court further ruled and I again quote, “There is no violation of the Sherman Act by Huck's establishment of the prices, terms, and conditions of sale for the patent lock vaults and the following thereof by the licensee Townsend or it is established law under the General Electric case that it is not a violation of the Sherman Act for licensee to follow the terms, prices, and conditions of sale or patent owner by agreement to do so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="276.969" offset="1211225">Now, the Government in its appeal has contended that decision of the court below should be reversed for either of two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.981" offset="1251244">First, and our main reason that the decision of this Court in US v. General Electric that a license to make a patented article on conditions of the licensee maintains its prices at a level set by the patentee does not in and out of itself violate the Sherman Act, that's the Rule in General Electric was erroneous and should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.928" offset="1343091">Or secondly, that in any event, the General Electric decision should not be interpreted to protect an agreement by a patentee, not to grant additional licenses as long as its licensee follows the prices which he sets.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="327.527" stopTime="328.355">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="327.527" offset="1413517">Oh, yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="turner" startTime="328.355" stopTime="447.643">
            <label>Mr. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="328.355" offset="1416756">Now, before turning to a consideration of the issues -- these issues on the merits, I should like to discuss briefly and all the way, we'll have to come back to it again, a question raised by defendant and fairly read, namely whether in the circumstances of this case it is appropriate for the Court to consider the issue whether the General Electric decision should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.470" offset="1533262">That issue was raised by the following facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.669" offset="1550085">Subsequent to the entry of the judgment below and the filing of the notice of the Notice of Appeal, the District Court granted defendant's motion to supplement the record by adding two pretrial orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.602" offset="1609749">These orders had been drafted by the Court in 1962 submitted to counsel, the suggestions and signed by the judge, but contrary to belief of all counsel had not been entered on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.966" offset="1659277">The Government did not object to this much of the motion by defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.218" offset="1680280">In addition, however, at the request of the defendants and although the Government's vigorous objection, the District Court added the following statement to one of the pretrial orders and I again I quote, “On October 15, which is the date of the pretrial hearing, reporting on the applicability of the General Electric case.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.540" offset="1761573">The Government stated that it is not attempting to have a doctrine set in the General Electric case overruled and stated only that facts in this case do not follow in that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.742" offset="1806294">That the doctrine is a still good law but does not apply as the actions in this case are illegal without the application of the doctrine and that it will write a letter by December 29 describing in what way the facts of this case differed from the facts of the General Electric case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="442.556" offset="1873586">That letter was subsequently written and was incorporated in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.413" offset="3737057">I just want to say again at this point that the Court is free if it thinks it appropriate to consider this issue and we urge that the issue isn't sufficient importance that it should, and further that we urge that it is not -- would not be unfair to the appellees to do so and finally that the failure to do so has not deprived this Court anything of any particular use.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.143" offset="3859937">Now, in connection with this, I will say further at this point the Government did contend below as it's now contending that the General Electric Rule should not be extended to cover the case whereas here according to the Government's allegations the patentee agreed not to grant additional licenses as long as the licensee abides by its prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.207" offset="3968188">That is to say, the Government did take the position below.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.878" offset="3982921">And of course again does here that a combination of an exclusive license with a Price Fixing Clause should not come within the ambit of GE's protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.793" offset="4026493">Now, as I read the appellees brief to agree or substantially agree that position raises almost all, if not all of the relevant, the factual legal considerations that a outright attack on the GE Rule does because it virtually destroys GE and I must say this in all candor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.865" offset="4138820">If, as appellees urge and we do not agree on this point, the GE Rule is confined to a Price Fixing Clause in a single license and the Government urged below that where the license is exclusive the Price Fixing Clause is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.080" offset="4223666">What is left of General Electric is very hard detect?</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.589" offset="4241742">So, at least insofar as the unfairness issue is concerned we believe that the Government's position below put appellees to the kind of proof which they urge now that they should have had an opportunity to put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.333" offset="4312691">But beyond this, and this is really the most important part that what I want to say, at least for the moment with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.527" offset="4349471">We contend that the relevant, factual and legal issues raised by the GE Rule are simply not issues on which any record would have provided this Court with any material help and it is for that reason that I think it is appropriate now, although I will come back again to the question of the Court and as of dealing with the issue, appropriate now to take a careful look at the merits because if we are right on this, we think the Court should take this opportunity to overrule the General Electric case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.643" offset="4969932">I had insist suggested that I proceed to a discussion on the merits of the GE Rule because I think, the merits of the position that as we see them have a very strong bearing on the question of whether or not the Court should decide that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.586" offset="5049762">I will give only the brief as of historical reviews because the Court is quite familiar with these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.445" offset="5089155">The problem of the right of a patentee to insert a price fixing limitation in a license has been with us for over 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.570" offset="5129697">When it first came to this Court and they met the hero, the Court decided that it was alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.432" offset="5161148">Apparently, on the basis that since the patent granted a monopoly and that the whole purpose of the patent statute was monopoly that any restrictions otherwise not contravention of public policy would be alright if it all they did was maintain that monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.073" offset="5243695">Intervening decisions between the Beament case and General Electric where the Beament Rule was reaffirmed, cast considerable doubt on the proposition that Beament was still a good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.538" offset="5301478">I think probably motion picture patents was most significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.778" offset="5322480">In that case, the Court held that it was not within the right of the patent -- not within the patent right to license or sell the patented product on condition that the licensee or purchaser by other non-patented items from the patentee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.937" offset="5403146">The Court said that any such agreement or any restrictions in connections with the contract of license or sale would be decided by general law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.405" offset="5437001">They were not logically a part of patent grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.781" offset="5454451">Now, whatever maybe said about the reasoning motion picture patents as I say, it indicated a fundamentally different approach to the general area of patent licensing restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.287" offset="5504502">Subsequent cases, reasserting the proposition that a patentee could not impose resell price restrictions on purchases from him and the development of other law in the -- in the tying area suggested that when the issue came to this Court again, it would decide the other way but it did not as we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.772" offset="5594467">Now in General Electric, the Rule was reaffirmed on the basis that the restriction was as the Court put it normally and reasonably adapted to secure the patentees pecuniary reward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.005" offset="5655385">Again, subsequent cases, all demonstrated a considerable lack of confidence to say the least in the Court's view and the GE Rule, it was not in any significant decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.307" offset="5716616">The basis for absolving price fixing restrictions and in Mason -- pardon me, inline material four judges of this Court were prepared to overrule General Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.367" offset="5768861">Now, I think it's fair to say that now if not at an earlier point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.162" offset="5796028">it is clear that neither that the Beament case nor the General Electric case provided an adequate underpinning for the result because they did not deal with what may now be seen to be the real questions and those questions are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.436" offset="5873142">First, whether the grant of the rights to price fix and a license makes any detectable contribution to the main purpose of the patent laws, a proposition which the Beament case and GE simply assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.158" offset="5931969">Second, whether if it does not and I believe it is clear that it does not make any contribution to patent policy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.092" offset="5967705">If promotes or detracts from a pro-competitive fallacy which is the core of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.407" offset="5992991">Now, as I say we believe a careful examination of these questions which is clearly to conclusion that GE was wrong and if this Court sees fit to deal with issue should over -- it should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.687" offset="6042102">Now, first, we maintain that contrary to what was assumed in General Electric, the decision whether or not permitted patentee to put a Price Fixing Clause in his license makes no detectable contribution of the purpose the patent law whatsoever and they end up to treat the issue as one of reconciling patent law and anti-trust law is itself a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.303" offset="6140635">The purpose of the patent law, main purpose as this Court has repeatedly said is to encourage inventive efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.017" offset="6171460">The devotion of time and expenditure to invention by offering a reward, the right to exclude all others from making using or selling the subject matter of the invention, so that the only possible impact of the decision of GE issue, on the purpose of the patent statute, would be that if it -- it would be enhancing a reward and thus attraction inventive efforts which might otherwise would not take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.082" offset="6299669">We believe that, its' quite clear, that this simply does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.003" offset="6319417">For one thing, and I wish at this point to cast no reflections of the patent system, we do not really know if the patent statute itself makes a net contribution to the flow of innovations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.598" offset="6373752">We know that much research would go on without the patent grant because of competitive pressures and because people are motivated by reasons other than pecuniary as Professor Machlup, who studied the issue about as much as anyone has said, “none of the empirical evidence at our disposal and none of the theoretical arguments presented either confirms or confutes the belief that the patent system has promoted the progress with technical arts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.697" offset="6486183">No economist on the basis of present knowledge could possibly state uncertainty that the patent system as it now operates, confers a net benefit or a net loss on the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.380" offset="6532890">Now, setting this aside, it is clear that whatever the reward, it is that the patent statute confers, the right to insert a Price Fixing Clause in a license, particularly, if this is limited to a single license which is the basis on which appellees proceed here is of marginal value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.591" offset="6621706">It is un awfully thin slice but whatever the pie is and it is of marginal value even after the patent is obtained in light of the right that the patentee has to charge any royalty up to what the patent is worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.847" offset="6690774">The right to limit the number -- and the right to limit the number of licensees thus minimizing the likelihood of vigorous price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.431" offset="6733093">But what it is worth after the fact is not relevant to the question of the bearing of this issue on the patent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.679" offset="6762036">The real question is, to what extent if any, is it considered when the prospective decision by the inventor or the corporation as the case maybe is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.486" offset="6813341">Now, here it seems clear that a company contemplating research or an inventor contemplating individual efforts is dealing with such in-determinant figures that such a marginal aspect of the patent right is what is involved here could not have any decisive influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.406" offset="6892962">In important respect, what the patent law creates is something like a lottery, promising rich rewards to the few who make out, in this respect even a substantial reduction in the value of the eventual payoffs or maximum payoffs, would make no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.004" offset="6979375">To use a simpler example, anyone who will put up $1 to win a $1,000 is very likely to put up the same dollar to win 500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.092" offset="7023783">A fortiori to win 975 which is my example is probably more what the loss of the right to price fix would reflect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.064" offset="7063594">Therefore, as the Government's view and we believe we are correct again, that the question here is not one of reconciling patent law with anti-trust law but rather whether given the fact that the patent statute gives the patentee the right to exclude all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.691" offset="7138095">The right to price fix any license will promote anti-trust policy in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.483" offset="7169337">Now, look at in this way, and we believe this is the only way that it can be looked at reasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.451" offset="7193161">The GE Rule is a wise Rule only if all of the following propositions are true or probably true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.895" offset="7230986">First, that the availability of the right to insert a price fixing provision in a license induces licensing in a significant number of cases where without that right, licensing would not take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.347" offset="7284799">If it does not do that, it makes no contribution to competition under any circumstances and what you have is simply a gratuitous restriction that must represent in that loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.205" offset="7336208">Second, even if it induces licensing in a significant number of cases, we must believe that in cases where it is so induced, licensing will more often than not over the long run produce a better competitive situation and if licensing had not taken place, an issue which I will again shortly discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.227" offset="7444250">Third, even if there is a net gain in this respect, we must believe that that net gain, if any and we don't think there is any, out ways the economic losses that result on price restrictions imposed in situations where licensing would have taken place anyway, and the economic cost to society of the elicit use of price fixing for cartel purposes, in cases which it imports when agencies either cannot detect, lack the resources to prosecute or able to terminate only or after the arrangements have lasted for some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.402" offset="7609031">It is, I believe which we hope to support that it is highly, unlikely that these prepositions are correct that whatever reasoned analysis we can bring to bear on the basis of present knowledge, suggest to the contrary that the GE Rule does more harm than good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.278" offset="7680502">But that in any event, no record which might have been developed in this case would have been any material help in shedding light on those propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.136" offset="7723865">Now, first, does the GE Rule induce licensing in a significant number cases, where otherwise no licensing would take place?</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.091" offset="7771721">We do not think so, but we do not pretend to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.340" offset="7792724">We do know this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.351" offset="7800769">In many cases, patentees have not and would not license even with the opportunity to the price fix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.214" offset="7832221">This tendency not to license, in fact, appears to be strongest and one would suppose it would be in those cases which perhaps we fear the most when we talk about what good the GE Rule might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.340" offset="7884779">Namely, the case where the patent is extraordinarily strong and promises to the patentee, a high assurance of the 17 year of monopoly, in fact with nobody coming around to be him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.525" offset="7941517">It is interesting to note in this connection that the Alcoa case often cited as one of the unfortunate consequences of licensing is a case where precisely that was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.930" offset="7991045">Despite the availability of the right to put a Price Fixing Clause in license Alcoa never licensed anybody in the hope which turned out to be well founded that nobody within 17 years could invent around them and that they would have established in almost impregnable monopoly position.</text>

            <label>Mr. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="2026.393" offset="8208906">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.480" offset="8213295">Their original basic patent the one which they never did licensed are collection of patents, my memory is not too clear on it, go way back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.524" offset="8245478">I think the last basic patent expired somewhere around 1915, and by that time their position was so strong that they in effect had a domestic monopoly until the post war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.370" offset="8296887">Now, how about those cases where patentee is do consider licensing?</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.304" offset="8324577">Let me note again, the value of the right to put in Price Fixing Clause is no more than a marginal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.411" offset="8365014">Whatever the value is can be converted into a higher royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.121" offset="8383822">Some higher royalty would measure the value to the patentee, and the right is decisive to the patentee or decisively influences his decision to license only when he translates it into such a high royalty that no one will pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.684" offset="8462085">Now, if GE applies only to a single license, the difference between price fixing and the protection which a patentee gets from a higher royalty plus a considerable confidence that only two producers will not compete very vigorously in price, a common industrial phenomenon is very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.354" offset="8572740">Now, whatever maybe said for this, it is perfectly clear that in this case and in all other cases in which patentees face the decision whether to license are not, there are many other potent reasons for a licensing which have been and would be decisive even if the price fixing right were taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.627" offset="8665840">Take a look at the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.076" offset="8683708">The trial judge found as a matter of fact or appeared to that the principal reason or one of the main reasons why Huck license (Inaudible) was a demand by Huck's customers and potential customers for a second source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.368" offset="8740864">In order to minimize shortages, speed deliveries and avoid the danger that labor dispute might shut down the only supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.410" offset="8773047">These reasons would have been -- did exist and would exist whether the price fixing right were present or not and they are a powerful inducement to a company like Huck to license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.050" offset="8815574">Secondly, there maybe expanding demand or excess demand which can be met more quickly by licensing other producers than by internal expansion of facilities, which is to say the patentee can profit more quickly and at a greater rate by licensing rather than by its own internal expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.650" offset="8901987">Also, licensing gives additional income without having to make capital expenditures and thus running the risk of heavy capital losses in the event of declining demand in the future, whether because the commodity is no longer wanted or because someone has invented rounding and has come up with a better substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.497" offset="8985370">Let me repeat the point the enormous advantage of any patentee in licensing is that he does not risk capital losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.465" offset="9025181">Now, finally there are some reasons which again we're apparently present in this case and are probably in almost certain present in all cases of what somewhat last repute but they should be mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.339" offset="9080769">And that reason is that the would be licensee, if not given a license may invent around the patent or may in litigation establish the invalidity of the patent or lack of infringement, so the patentee will have a competitor with no royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.141" offset="9147956">Also, that the licensee may slow down the development or terminate the development of competing goods, if he has the protection a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.377" offset="9196857">In short, even where licensing is beneficial or neutral as in the case of expanding or excess demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.539" offset="9225488">It seems to us that in most cases the patentee is likely to license without price fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.949" offset="9251192">He's still retains the right to pick his licensee carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.407" offset="9268955">There's little likelihood of price competition in a situation of exist or expanding demand and unless the cost advantage of a licensee is decisive and as I pointed out, he can avoid that by picking another licensee, all of the reasons, the advantages that he has for licensing will still exist, or he does it for the other reasons that I suggested to forestall competitive innovation, to forestall litigation which maybe fatal to his patent or to his claim of infringement that those reasons may still compel him to license but it should be added and this is a matter, I will get to shortly in more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.371" offset="9432900">It's quite clear there's no public interest in encouraging him to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.275" offset="9456515">Summing up, looking at the matter as best as we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.266" offset="9476472">Given the marginal value of the GE Rule in the single license case and the strong reasons for licensing anyway, we believe it is fair to say that the best guess seems clearly to be that the GE Rule will induce licensing in a relatively small number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.614" offset="9541778">Now, would we know any more about this if the issue were thrown open for record evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.208" offset="9572185">We think the answer is clearly no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.545" offset="9585560">The question raise is one of probabilities which if answerable at all, would be answerable only on the basis of careful studies of a statistically significant and statistically representative number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.819" offset="9646686">No such studies exist and it seems highly unlikely that they are feasible in a forceable future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.138" offset="9675943">I think we might get a good inkling as to this later point by asking by asking the question, what would we have learn in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.519" offset="9709484">If the GE Rule had put in the question and defendants and or the Government would have attempted to put in a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.894" offset="9750967">I presume that defendant Huck would have testified that price fixing was vital to the decision, although, we would have a nice dilemma in view of the fact that he then can still vigorously resist the preposition, if there was any such agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.931" offset="9811048">I suppose the defendants will always testify to this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.869" offset="9834872">But such testimony is clearly worthless unless backed up by objective evidence and of what kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.237" offset="9868309">Well, here, there was some evidence that Townsend was more efficient and that Huck feared this but Huck might still have relied on higher royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.572" offset="9909687">And Huck clearly had many reasons for licensing which I have already recounted which appeared in the record, which may well have been decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.890" offset="9946885">Indeed, as I just suggested that Huck vigorously denies that any price fixing agreement existed and it did license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.422" offset="9981053">And the District Court appeared to find that it did so for reasons wholly apart from price fixing as it would have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.343" offset="10008743">Now, all of these factors are present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.560" offset="10025566">They are going to be present in any case and the question we ask is, how can any confident judgment be reached as to what the result would have been in view of the (Inaudible) and non-quantifiable nature of the considerations involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.463" offset="10105187">And if this is so, for the individual case, how could any economic study of a statistical nature of any value ever be conducted?</text>

            <text syncTime="2544.356" offset="10280835">It seems to us that to the extent that reliance has been put on the GE Rule, despite good reasons to believe that it has not been the solidest of precedents that this could be taken care of in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.679" offset="10362128">One in any Government action, the Government could as it has here simply request the future injunction against the continuation of the agreement or an injunction against or decree that the clause if it's in the contract, it's unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.681" offset="10434121">In treble damage actions when and if such cases would arise, this Court could then decide whether an overruling of GE should or should not be given prospective effect and the Government feels it would be very appropriate case as was done in the case last year arising out of Knapp v. Ohio –- would be a very appropriate case for the Court to apply the ruling only prospectively.</text>

            <text syncTime="2670.234" offset="10784266">But I don't think the question how many people have these agreements would -- is a question that could be got at.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.935" offset="10851140">People, who suspect the validity of any such agreement, are not likely broadcast it, and how many unknown agreements there are?</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.794" offset="10894503">I don't think I know and I don't think could be readily discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.777" offset="10918431">Now, I've asked the question whether the GE Rule seems likely to induce people to license in any significant number of cases where the otherwise would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.874" offset="10978826">But I'd like to go to the question which is also essential as I indicated -- essential support to GE and that in cases where price fixing does induce licensing, will the situation more often than not be better then if the patentee deprived of the right to put in a Price Fixing Clause didn't license at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.415" offset="11081017">Now, we know to say the least that licensing will not always produce a better situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.974" offset="11107244">For reasons that were set forth in the Court's opinion in Masonite and concurring opinion in Line Material and fears then expressed by the Court which really materialize in this case here, and will always be present, namely that the patentee may license simply to forestall competition which might otherwise develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.904" offset="11207032">Now, licensing is most likely to be beneficial, as I believe, I mentioned before in a case of strong patent promising a 17 year monopoly or more but these are rare and as I mentioned before where such a situation exists, the patentees are simply not likely to license anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.337" offset="11304730">So, price fixing is most likely to be utilized where the patents are weak, less basic, and here there is a less to be gained from licensing and less to be lost from no licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.143" offset="11355930">Now, whatever assessment is made, I have not covered all of the considerations and I probably haven't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.469" offset="11385292">Here, again, I submit that no record would help, look again at this case and ask yourself if it would really have been possible in any decisive or even barely satisfactory way to answer the question whether it would've been better in the long run if Huck had not licensed or whether as it did to, it did licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.581" offset="11493648">We have evidence in the record in the form of fears expressed that Townsend, if not given a license couldn't be in around the Huck's patent or beat it in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.682" offset="11538056">Now, perhaps more light could be shed on this issues on what might have happened if there had been a full range of testimony on the validity of the patent, and the likelihood in the light of the full range of the patent that are in the field that research would produce a substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.291" offset="11608586">But these issues are difficult at best and again, an answer in anyone case gives no answer whatsoever to probabilities which is the critical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.523" offset="11673475">Now, finally does the net gain so far and we believe if you had to make an estimate, that there's a net loss so far, from the GE Rule, out way the cost of permitting price fixing by any per se rule of per se legality in situations where licensing would've occurred anyway and that therefore the price fixing right is at risk gratuitous and added restriction serving no purpose at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.322" offset="11800639">And in those cases and we know that these exist, pages of this Court in past where the license is taken not so much for the patent but for the price fixing, and for the advantage that is gained by cementing an anti-competitive arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.029" offset="12679502">Now, I have come as I indicated the final question as to whether there any net gain in the GE Rule in terms what we knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.995" offset="12731329">We believe that again the probabilities are as best we can speculate that the losses exceed the gains but again we would insist and I don't think I have to labor the point now that it's hard to conceive of any record would provide any further enlightenment upon this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.821" offset="12830699">No decisive proof could be ever being gotten without a full survey, all instances in which licensing has occurred, what would have happened if had not occurred, instances, where price fixing was gratuitous and as and we suggest that such information is simply not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.744" offset="12914395">Now, I would like before concluding on this to deal specifically with one of the points raised by appellees and that is the suggestion and it is certainly a possibility that the removal of the protection afforded by the GE Rule might conceivably produce concentration or add the concentration in some industries by causing a small producer, who would otherwise stay in business to sell out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.281" offset="13052531">Now, as I say this is a possibility but I would like to examine the question whether it is anything worth pausing over one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.185" offset="13088162">First point, I would make is that a higher royalty will connect to small producer in every case where the value of this patent as measured by what the licensee is prepared to pay exceeds the cost disadvantage that the patentee operates under.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.132" offset="13171858">Whereas this is not so, the patentee may license a less efficient producer, he may license no one, or he may indeed sell out his patent to the more efficient producer or someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.574" offset="13237687">Now, how can we asses the consequences of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.826" offset="13262660">If he licensees to a less efficient producer, the public in terms of the price that it pays will lose nothing because the price would presumably if it is set by anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.323" offset="13320652">If he licenses no one for such time as his inefficiency lasts, there is indeed a temporary loss of output which might otherwise have been produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.991" offset="13379375">If he never does become more efficient, it is common guard in variety anti-trust law that he probably ought to go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.492" offset="13413334">And if he does sell out to the more efficient producer that too has much to recommend it, at least the public gets the benefit of lower prices and resources are being utilized by those best to able to utilize them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.985" offset="13479267">Moreover, to the extent that patent accumulations are purchase of patents by normal -- counter company is a problem, we have perfectly adequate ways of dealing with this under the anti-trust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.417" offset="13541021">I've raised an issue which this Court has not decided but I can suggest what the Government's position would clearly be that Section 7 of the Clayton Act applying to the acquisition or all of any or any of the part of the assets of a company includes within this comprehension patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.104" offset="13615835">And if the Government has a good cause of action under Section 7, if a dominant firm in an industry acquires patents which further its dominance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.973" offset="13663274">So in short, any serious consequences resulting from this seem to us to see the controllable in other and more satisfactory ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.100" offset="13711757">Now, let me try to conclude on the merits as we see them, the Court has three choices, a case by case approach to the issue raised here, a rule like GE that a single license Price Fixing Clause is a per se lawful and third position we defend that should be held unlawful per se.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.020" offset="14407450">We believe very simply that and we don't think on this the appellees would disagree that a case by case Rule makes no sense at all but you subject in effect, there's no law at all because the issues are so indetermined.</text>

            <text syncTime="3710.209" offset="14944214">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.916" offset="14959052">I shall get it a little into the facts of the case as presented by the record and review the time sequence of the Government's waiver of any intent to question the General Electric Rule in this case because that time sequence is a very important matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.874" offset="15030836">I will also discuss why it is inappropriate from the procedural stand point for the Court to reconsider General Electric on the present record and I also plan to point out some of the serious economic questions which would have to be resolved if General Electric is to be overruled and as to which proof could be made one way or the other and on which there is simply no record to proof whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.408" offset="15156955">Mr. Pomeroy will address himself to the Government's suggestion that there are certain pressing practical needs that require the overruling or the reconsideration of the General Electric case at this juncture and he may also briefly reply to the argument which Counsel made at the very end, if it is oral argument to the effect that even if General Electric is not overrule, there is something in this record that goes beyond the General Electric Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.603" offset="15297808">In this case, there were a simultaneous indictment and a civil complaint brought against Huck, the owner of the lockable patents and Townsend, its licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.090" offset="15359770">The criminal case was also brought against the Presidents of the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.017" offset="15383489">Before either case was tried there were pretrial conferences in the civil case in October of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.914" offset="15422986">There was pretrial conference in the civil case on the first of October and there the judge indicated some concern as to just what the issues were before him. Specifically and of course the defendants were very interested in these too, the question was whether the Government was seeking to have the General Electric case overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.853" offset="15514833">Counsel for the Government said that they were not in a position of that conference to say “yes or nay” to that question that they would have to confer presumably of their superiors in anti-trust division in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.697" offset="15578154">There was a resumed pretrial conference in the civil case, a brief one, on October 15 two weeks lately, when the Governments attorneys reported back as to what the position was as to the overruling of General Electric and as to what their position would be on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.175" offset="15672090">The first pretrial, the pretrial irrelevant to the first conference says, “After a restudy of the facts, the Government will advice defendants of its position.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.083" offset="15707721">This is on Page 767 and 768, “As to applicability of the General Electric case decision if any to this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.217" offset="15748263">And now the report of what happened on October 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.970" offset="15763205">On October 15, reporting on the applicability of the General Electric case, the Government stated that it is attempting to have the Doctrine set in the General Electric case overruled and stated only the facts in this case do not fall within that Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.246" offset="15836348">That the Doctrine is still good law but does not apply as the actions in this case are illegal without application of the Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.660" offset="15878040">And that it will write a letter by December 29 describing in what way of the facts of this case differ from the facts of the General Electric case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.240" offset="15916283">The Government did write such a letter and that letter appears on Page 779 of the record, it's a letter signed by -- on behalf of the 11 jurors and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of in anti-trust division and the letter itself well, not contain a statement quite as strong as that that the pretrial order recites still makes it perfectly clear that all the Government is charging is that the acts of the defendants went beyond the sanction by the General Electric case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.890" offset="16070928">Certain another statements in the record reinforce this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.006" offset="16091408">In the Government's trial brief, the summary of the Government's contentions were simply in terms of contentions that were made to effect that the conduct that was charge here went beyond that permissible under the General Electric case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.640" offset="16149922">And in the colloquy of Government counsel on the motion to dismiss appearing it 698 of the record the remarks are all to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.620" offset="16209899">At this point after the October pretrial conferences, the criminal trial took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.381" offset="16240933">The criminal trial took place before judge and the jury took place on February and March of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.174" offset="16276041">The Government did not challenge the General Electric case in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.167" offset="16295999">In fact, I think the very fact that they brought the criminal case on first indicates that overruling General Electric was not any part of their designs in this case as it was tried in the District Court and that it was completely remote from anyone's thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.616" offset="16361827">Very difficult to say that you could challenge conduct which was within the scope of an existing Supreme Court decision and in both criminal pains and penalties down upon the parties for following it and this of course was a prosecution against individuals, as well as against the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.320" offset="16444688">The basic transcript of record that we have before us is the transcript that was developed in the criminal case, we shall come in a moment to why that is so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.540" offset="16501530">And of course in the criminal case, there was no challenge whatsoever made to the General Electric case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.326" offset="16536639">The Government put evidence in the criminal case, the basic patent license that was involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.807" offset="16570598">I was somewhat surprised to hear Counsel say that the parties here denied that there was any price fixing and that price fixing considerations motivated them and the original licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.393" offset="16624933">Actually, there is a Price Fixing Clause in the patent license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.578" offset="16649697">The patent license starts on the 469 of the record and there is a two year Price Fixing Clause provided in paragraph 12 of the patent license.</text>

            <text syncTime="4159.255" offset="16740394">That Section 12 (a), 12 (b) is the price restrictive -- 12 (a) is the exclusivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.261" offset="16776443">Those two provisions expired by their terms in September of 1956 and we do not understand the Government be contending here that a price restriction which expired back that which is over nine years ago could now be the basis of an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.839" offset="16866722">Their cases as I understand it that there was a continuing price restriction here beyond the two-year period and that that if General Electric is overruled could be the subject matter of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.221" offset="16932237">It could be the reason why there is any real controversy presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.678" offset="16966092">The Government did not present any evidences to what the relevant market was here – whether there were extent to which there were substitute products for lock bolts, the extent to which Lock Bolts gave a party that was able to lawfully manufacture them and the sort of dominance in the general fastener market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.395" offset="17060968">The Government in fact objected when the defense managed to get in some proof as to the existence of substitute products for Lock Bolts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.185" offset="17108093">Now, the governments in this case had a gentlemen, who I think we could refer to us who as their star witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.510" offset="17141426">It was a Mr. Robert Looker, who was the step son of Mr. Lou Huck, who is the founder of Huck Manufacturing Company, the patentee here actually is Mr. Huck who is the inventor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.447" offset="17193148">He had been an officer of Huck until 1956 when he left and formed his own company, he left about four years after his father -- his step-father died.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.075" offset="17243721">Mr. Looker testified and he chose to identify the time of this as a meeting that was held in 1954 prior to the time that party is entered into this written patent license agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.173" offset="17312057">He testified that at that meeting, there came a time when the Executives asked their lawyers to step out of the room and that the Presidents of the two corporations agreed that while the patent license itself would only provide perhaps for a two-year exclusivity and a two-year Price Restrictive Clause that those features of the license would continue for -- and this is alternatively given for the life of the patents or for the life of the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.739" offset="17454373">Mr. Looker at this time, at the time you testify to this had a trouble damage suit on file against the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.205" offset="17496168">It was based on the failure of Huck to license the company that Mr. Looker had gone to under the Huck patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.371" offset="17536815">Naturally, it would be an important ingredient in Mr. Looker's case that there be an exclusive feature in the agreement of this exclusive feature be a continuing one because he left Huck about the time that the two-year period expired and that it was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.990" offset="17635349">And there is a considerable correspondents that was brought up in the record showing that Mr. Looker was the Justice Department's informant in this matter and that in fact as the District Court found, he initiated the filing of this action by the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.083" offset="17707656">There was given an evidence even in connecting with the Looker's testimony, in fact, some of these are Government direct exhibits which contained contradictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.858" offset="17746840">There was given an evidence say considerable number of memoranda that Mr. Looker wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.563" offset="17765648">He was a great writer of memoranda that were completely inconsistent with the story that there was a continuing price restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.200" offset="17808175">He wrote a lot of memoranda saying that in September 1956, the price restriction will expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.533" offset="17833462">In September 1956, we'll be free to license anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.121" offset="17859897">At close of the criminal case, criminal case was tried to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.381" offset="17880900">The district judge took the case away from the jury and he held that even crediting Looker's testimony that under the General Electric case, there was no proof of any violation of the Sherman Act made out, and he granted the judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.230" offset="17948296">Incidentally the Government, I'm sure inadvertently in their the brief refers to the district judge in the criminal case as believing Mr. Looker's testimony when he says that the Government showed such and such at least prima facie.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.379" offset="18008900">Now since he was sitting with the jury, there was no issue as to whether he believed the Government or not, at this point, that was a function for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.309" offset="18044635">In order for him to take the case away from the jury, he had to rule as a matter of law that even accepting Mr. Looker's story on its face that there was no violation of law, and in fact there is none under the General Electric case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6272.600" offset="25193723">There's a net gain for competition here in the fact that because the patentee can create this second source on an acceptable basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="6521.658" offset="26190033">I think the method to what we would have shown, would have been that despite the name of the General Electric case, the General Electric Rule at this point is so limited that the very large manufacturing companies will happen to own patents, have no real use for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6547.379" offset="26292851">The main use comes in the case of the smaller patentees and it would -- the various restrictions that the Courts have engrafted on the General Electric case, basically are the ones that make it in unsuitable vehicle for a dominant producer of a large corporation that has considerable economic muscle from using the General Electric privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="6644.109" offset="26679777">Mr. Pomeroy, will get into this a little further but fact of the matter is that the oral agreement was before -- the alleged oral agreement was before the written agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.912" offset="26719065">And in effect to what it was, was an agreement that while the face of the license would say in Clause 12, that there would be a price restriction for two years and an exclusivity feature for two years, really what the parties mentioned what they would live up to and in effect what is their agreement was that those two Clauses would run for the life of the patent license.</text>
            <text syncTime="6681.980" offset="26831287">So in effect, the -- what you had according to Looker's testimony was an oral 17-year or I guess there were 13 years then left in the patent, an oral 13-year General Electric license.</text>
            <text syncTime="6696.298" offset="26888547">So on our review, if the Court holds the Government to its waiver and doesn't require into the continued validity of General Electric, there should be an affirmance without respect to whether there was the oral agreement or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="6730.380" offset="27024906">As Mr. Lyons said in answer to Mr. Justice Harlan's question I was going to speak a little bit about this question of the so-called oral agreement or side agreement and I'll be glad to speak about as much as time permits but I don't really see the necessity for it in the light of the way my Brother for the Government has pitched the case here this morning because he said in his oral argument that he viewed point two of the Government's brief with something less than enthusiasm.</text>
            <text syncTime="6761.425" offset="27149040">And actually as it's put in the brief, I sort of got that impression because it's only three pages out of the very considerable number of pages at the -- in the lower Court, it is quite true that this side agreement was looked upon as more or less the (Inaudible) might say, it was really what the Government was shooting for as an elicit, non-general electric type of price fixing and non-patent kind of price fixing almost in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6800.931" offset="27307133">But as it has developed on appeal, this appeal is pitched almost entirely on the naked question there to sustain or to overrule General Electric and not on this other matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6813.918" offset="27359065">Now, as of -- just to pursue that just one step further as in this and as to repeat clearly what Mr. Lyons said, the court below and the witness Looker, I should say, that witness Looker and the court below construed this oral agreement to make the price fixing for the life of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6838.401" offset="27456972">And also to keep the patent exclusive for the same period, merely a supplement to or a minimum power to the written agreement which was a normal and straight forward ordinary kind of patent license agreement which is in the record as GX 17 and which appears at page 469 of the record here, and as was brought out in an answer to a prior question, I'm quite -- to the contrary of the impression which Mr. Turner gave that there was some effort to conceal this arrangement, it is set forth in an extensive -- in paragraph 12 of the written agreement and the gist and the thrust of the Looker testimony really was that for some reason or another the parties orally agreed to make this not just the two-year deal but a 13-year arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="7032.869" offset="28234898">That was just an oral amendment or supplement and the Court said that under GE, this is alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="7040.478" offset="28265305">The Court went further to say that the -- in the post two-year period, there was no evidence whatever that Townsend, the licensee whom I was represented -- do represent, was encroaching the patentees' position as the one who should decide whether or not to grant additional licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="7064.398" offset="28360913">There's absolutely nothing in the record at all to show any kind of consultation on this subject or control by the licensee, of who else should be admitted or whether anybody else should be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="7078.434" offset="28417128">And in fact as the record show the couple of Titanium manufacturers were admitted as licensees in this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="7090.558" offset="28465612">The points that Mr. Lyons has made I think almost complete the case, Your Honor, except to say that in addition to asking you to overrule long standing precedent where there's been a waiver that this wasn't being attempted and we're as we say, the record was willfully inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7116.342" offset="28568743">The Government is also saying that you should do this because the case involved, General Electric has been so devitalized that it might as well now be buried and we respectfully dissent from this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7135.746" offset="28646379">General Electric has not in fact been weakened.</text>
            <text syncTime="7140.199" offset="28664142">It has been, I think defined and be limited and clarified by the decisions of this Court in New Wrinkle and Masonite, Line Material and Gipson, all cases in the 1940's.</text>
            <text syncTime="7155.832" offset="28726732">And these basic cases plus a number of lower court cases in the same general period has served very adequately to clearly set forth what General Electric does not permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7171.453" offset="28789217">General Electric does not permit predatory attempts at cartelization of industries or regimenting of an industry, as this Court called it in the Gipson case and these attempts apparently have now falling by the way side.</text>
            <text syncTime="7191.057" offset="28867584">At the same time that these cases that I referred to, were being decided in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7198.514" offset="28897468">There were the congressional amendments introduced which had Mr. Justice Harlan inquired about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7205.393" offset="28924949">These were all in the 1940's and it is of course true that this may have been the judge-made law, judge-made rule but certainly Congress could have spoken to them, to the problem had it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="7220.303" offset="28984613">Especially when it was recasting the entire patent code, but it felt that not to do so and I suggest it may well seem fit not to do so because of the clarification, clarity that emerged from New Wrinkle and Gipson and Masonite and Line Material.</text>
            <text syncTime="7239.162" offset="29060054">There wasn't any need for further legislation at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7243.609" offset="29077817">So the scope of GE is well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="7247.337" offset="29092760">To speak for just one other point, the Government has said that the case has been a pernicious breeder of litigation over the years and that this is another reason why it should be taken into the per se area where litigation is perhaps simpler for the government at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="7271.474" offset="29189308">But in their brief, we have no reason to doubt it.</text>
