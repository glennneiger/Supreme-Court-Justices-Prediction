            <text syncTime="58.615" offset="337795">Petitioner stands convicted upon three counts of forgery, three counts of uttering forged documents, one count of breaking and entering an uninhabited dwelling in the night season, and one count of grand larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.406" offset="388995">He filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Ohio Supreme Court pursuant to a provision which allows the Ohio Supreme Court to exercise original jurisdiction in such actions attacking the conviction upon the basis of which he was incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.740" offset="446360">His petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.040" offset="463496">This case is before this Court on review on petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.922" offset="483035">Petitioner was tried and convicted in a trial in which he was denied the right to cross-examine the witnesses who appeared against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.056" offset="511561">He was denied the right to confront certain of the witnesses who appeared against him by statement alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.902" offset="534967">He was denied the right to have adequate notice of the charges upon which he was ultimately convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.037" offset="555551">He was charged by indictment upon -- with certain offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.767" offset="570389">He was tried upon entirely different offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.778" offset="586480">Petitioner contends that in these circumstances he was denied the right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.705" offset="626186">He was denied the right to contest the state's case by any means whatsoever in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.184" offset="652100">He was denied the right to adequate notice of the charges upon which he was ultimately convicted in violation of the Fourteenth and the Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.814" offset="686582">The circumstances which give rise to these claims are contained in a record not of very great length.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.532" offset="713540">I would invite the Court's attention to pages 20 and 21 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.016" offset="735483">A colloquy occurs upon those pages which gives rise to the controversy presently before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.501" offset="765367">In that colloquy, defense counsel, appointed counsel, first brought to the attention of the trial court that the case was before the Court on a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.544" offset="809566">I might state at this point that there was no such thing formerly known under the law of Ohio as a prima facie case, at least in the circumstances of a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.684" offset="854079">So, this is not a term which had a clearly defined meaning at the time the statement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.942" offset="875186">The Court however, attempts to articulate or express what a prima facie case is, and the Court states, “There's going to be no cross-examination of the witnesses so the Court will know and the state can't be taken by surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.401" offset="925027">The Court doesn't want to be fooled and have your client change his mind halfway through the trial and really contest it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="211.791" offset="950523">The state has a contest we want to know in fairness to them so they can put on complete proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.355" offset="972779">At that point, defense counsel attempted to reserve the right of cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.475" offset="989288">The Court, however, advised him that if the case were tried as a prima facie case, he would not be permitted to cross-examine at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.096" offset="1019800">And then added, ordinarily on a prima facie case, the prima facie case is where the defendant not technically or legally in effect, admits his guilt and wants the state to prove it.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.120" offset="1059819">Mr. Messerman, you said that in your studies preparing for this argument you found those such anomalous as anywhere in Ohio and that confirms my recollection, but did you learn that in this county or in some counties this is a -- this is the usual way of proceeding in a criminal case, did you --</text>

            <text syncTime="256.860" offset="1130768">I did not learn that, Mr. Justice Stewart, until the state's brief was filed in this case and I was unadvised by the state that this is a common practice in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.324" offset="1176639">If it is a common practice, it is a practice of which I am totally unfamiliar and furthermore, it is a practice with which the Ohio Supreme Court was apparently unfamiliar because the Ohio Supreme Court groping for some means to justify the very unusual procedure which occurred in this case held that this was comparable to a no contest plea despite the fact that there is no such thing as the no contest plea --</text>

            <text syncTime="291.462" offset="1269217">And the Court -- the Ohio Supreme Court recognize this as a rather unusual procedure but said despite the fact that it was an unusual procedure, there was no reason for not accepting it if it in fact, corresponded or protected all of the defendant's rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.051" offset="1363571">Did he define what a prima facie proceeding was?</text>

            <text syncTime="320.420" offset="1385096">There is certainly much confusion left with respect to what a prima facie case (Inaudible) -- case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.951" offset="1403173">We do know that in the mind of the Court, it meant no cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.427" offset="1417070">We do know that in the mind of the Court, it meant no contest by any means whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.637" offset="1433893">We do know in the mind of the Court that it was not a trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.791" offset="1450506">On page 23, the Court, when Mr. Ergazos, who was defense counsel, asserted his first objection to evidence which the state attempted to introduce, Mr. Ergazos objected, the Court said, “Are you trying the case on the merits or just want the state to make a prima facie case?”</text>
            <text syncTime="355.905" offset="1526993">So, apparently, it is not a trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.075" offset="1539636">Now, we do not know whether a prima facie case requires the state to establish proof -- guilt by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.254" offset="1572342">The record strongly indicates that it does not that there must merely be some evidence or perhaps substantial evidence, but whether it was required to establish guilt by proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a matter left in very substantial doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.236" offset="1620302">We don't know what a prima facie case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.445" offset="1633155">The petitioner apparently had some notion though of what was going on and, when he saw what was going on, he brought his objection to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.833" offset="1674742">And, the time at which he made that objection, the sequence in which the objection occurs is of substantial importance in this case because, I would submit to the Court that the state is able to make even a pretense of justifying the fairness of what occurred in this case only by ignoring an important part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.907" offset="1754990">The Court stated, the Court knowing that and the prosecutor knowing that instead of having a half-dozen witnesses on one point, they only have one because they were -- well, they understand there will be no contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.702" offset="1798144">Now, it is at this point that the defendant for the first time says, “I would like to point out in no way am I pleading guilty to this charge.”</text>

            <text syncTime="433.485" offset="1837328">This is on page 22 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.217" offset="1848195">Now, the state ignores the intervening paragraph and suggests that the defendant was asserting this protest solely to the Court's statement which appears on the bottom of page 21, the Court statement being a prima facie case is one in which the defendant, not technically or legally in effect admits his guilt and wants the state to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.267" offset="1932413">That isn't specifically what he was objecting to although one might assume that he was objecting to that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.175" offset="1952057">But he was objecting to the proposition that there was going to be no contest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.267" offset="1980479">And the Court said, “If you want to stand trial, we will give you a jury trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="473.255" offset="1996361">Now, as petitioner contends and as the state acknowledges, in the State of Ohio the defendant has an absolute right to waive jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.633" offset="2029902">It is not a matter of discretion with the Court to determine whether or not he should be permitted to waive his right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.476" offset="2053308">He did waive his right to jury trial here and he could demand a trial by the Court (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="505.977" offset="2127287">Now, what's the significance of that, notwithstanding the petitioner's objections?</text>

            <text syncTime="519.356" offset="2180786">He quite clearly did not demonstrate that because he attempted to reserve, for example, the right to cross-examine witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.743" offset="2206386">He thought by entering this plea whatever it was, he could reserve that right should anything new be brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.134" offset="2227911">But the Court advised him that he could not reserve that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.016" offset="2239404">In addition, he apparently thought that he could assert objection to evidence which he considered inadmissible but the trial court apparently thought that he had waived that right also by agreeing to have a prima facie case tried by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.920" offset="2291022">I submit to the Court that no one could know what a prima facie case was precisely in the circumstances of this case or any other case.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.394" offset="2388929">And the first reason is that it is quite obvious from the record that he didn't know what he was waiving and at the very least, in order to find waiver or in order to impute waiver by counsel to one's client, the record should contain some indication that the waiver by the attorney was made intelligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.863" offset="2466774">This record contains no such indication.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.758" offset="2478373">The contrary demonstrates that it was not made intelligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.556" offset="2489553">And, secondly, even assuming that it had been made intelligently, even assuming that the attorney didn't know what a prima facie case was, the defendant here specifically objected to the proceeding which was about to ensue.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.800" offset="2906572">These were the personal rights of the accused that were involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.251" offset="2936351">Every right that the accused has in a criminal proceeding is his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.076" offset="2955682">Now, the needs of the orderly administration of justice required the establishment of certain rules whereby those rights are exercised by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.428" offset="3001135">Nonetheless, they remain the personal rights of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.395" offset="3012942">It is the accused who went to jail in this case and not his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.842" offset="3030706">Since they are the personal rights of the accused where the accused attempts to assert those rights as he did in the circumstances of this case, a statement by his attorney which is quite clearly demonstrated to be made without full knowledge of its consequences should not be deemed a waiver of those critical constitutional rights involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.781" offset="3122448">Now, it is true, the attorney did make the statement, what he intended whether or not the petitioner knew what was intended by that statement or whether anyone knew what was intended by that statement is a matter in very substantial doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.457" offset="3177200">There is one thing that is perfectly clear upon this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.700" offset="3190157">The defendant was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses and he was denied the right, not only with respect to witnesses who actually appeared in the courtroom, but the -- perhaps a very critical testimony in this case involved the statement of an alleged co-offender, Mr. Ronald Mitchell, and that a statement of that alleged co-offender was introduced over objection, on page 39 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.835" offset="3306663">Now, this is a situation where critical testimony is presented against the petitioner not by a witness who appears in Court, who is subject to evaluation for purposes of determining his credibility at least by seeing him if not by cross-examination, assuming that that had been waived, but this is testimony which appears in the case and which is relied upon virtually entirely by the Court in finding the petitioner guilty of at least two of the offenses charged and it is testimony which is submitted to no test for purposes of determining credibility.</text>
