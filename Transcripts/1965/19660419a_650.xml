            <label>Mr. John H. Gunn</label>
            <text syncTime="27.988" offset="215333">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.166" offset="236022">The importance of the matter that we have before you today is reflected by an analysis in the Government's brief with which we hardly concur showing the increase nationally in debtor's relief proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.145" offset="295999">Now, the Government also points out that in, what I compute to be about 60% of those instances, we're referring to the Chapter XI analysis, the arrangement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.846" offset="342706">The proceeding results or the proceeding has failed and there is a resulting adjudication in bankruptcy with the replacement by the debtor of a creditors and the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.892" offset="398921">The question, therefore, of the case at hand is to what extent is the trustee or stated even more directly, to what extent is the general estate responsible for income taxes withholding taxes that is to say and other taxes, federal taxes which have been collected by the Debtor in Possession dissipated prior to the adjudication not handed over to the creditor's representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.167" offset="516054">And must the trustee respond on a claim and pay interest on those funds which he did not receive as well as paying the principal of the funds which we concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.397" offset="564955">And is he subject to penalties if he fails to return?</text>
            <text syncTime="120.009" offset="583450">Those are the problems of with which we're faced today.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.398" offset="596929">Problem receives a little added emphasis from the fact that in 1952, presumably because of this increase in debtor's reli -- debtors relief provisions and compositions of creditors, Congress changed Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.581" offset="669654">And in changing it, they subordinated the costs and expenses of the abortive debtor's relief provision to those of the liquidating bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.262" offset="712391">When the debtor was taken out after adjudication and the creditor's representative, the trustee replaced him.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.539" offset="741543">And in essence, these are the facts of the case of John Nicholas versus the United States that were before Your Honors on today decided coincidentally only ten days apart from an opposite decision on a virtually the same set of facts in the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.928" offset="807058">In this case there was a voluntary petition by a motel in Miami for an arrangement with its unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.808" offset="842585">For 40 days under court order, this debtor in possession managed its affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.651" offset="865991">And then on a petition drawn by creditors, it was adjudicated as its plan could not succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.384" offset="892949">It had in fact been dispossessed of the hotel premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.010" offset="907368">And a trustee was elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.042" offset="919489">The Government filed its tax claims subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.949" offset="935163">They claimed not only pre-petitioned interest or pre-petitioned taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.237" offset="960345">They claimed as well certain taxes which had been withheld, had been collected as cabaret taxes and as unemployment and social security taxes by the Debtor in Possession but never handed over to the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.527" offset="1017501">And presumably, used in the operations of the business or otherwise dissipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.230" offset="1040280">Accordingly, when the Trustee in Bankruptcy took over as the record shows, he received nothing in the way of transferred assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.989" offset="1071313">He subsequently was able by certain proceedings to gather together in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.535" offset="1093465">And now the Government in its tax claim as the principal of these taxes, as to assess the interest to the date that it filed its claim, as accrued interest thereafter up until the date of payment, and as to penalties against this trustee for his failure to make returns as to the Debtor in Possession's tax collection.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Gunn</label>
            <text syncTime="274.457" offset="1201194">The point that I first made, this is a fight between the general state and the United States rather than the trustee and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.358" offset="1236825">Now sir, our briefs I believe contained more history than we can cover in on your summary calendar.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.169" offset="1272038">They point out that for about 150 years under the English bankruptcy practice; there was a firm rule that there would be no grant of post-petition interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.576" offset="1305684">That in 1911, Justice Holmes recognized that in Sexton versus Dreyfus and those cases are set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.460" offset="1333164">That there was some confusion in the lower cases which we've discussed, which the Government has cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.281" offset="1356466">But that, the principal of no post-petition interest was memorialized as the word we used in the Saper decision in 1949 where this Court said that for a variety of reasons spelled out in that decision, they were not going to allow on award of post-petition interest on pre-petition tax obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.834" offset="1454686">We believe that the reasons for the denial of this post-petition interest may merit the Court's attention for a few moments because we believe they are as applicable in the situation at hand as they are in the situation where the Government taxes are not incurred by debtor in possession but were incurred prior to the filing of the arrangement petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.823" offset="1546637">We take strong issue with the Government on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.252" offset="1568371">First place, these decisions say that delay of distribution in bankruptcy is an act of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.683" offset="1594075">It's not attributable to the fault of a court officer if there's a delay in distribution to the Government of its claim that these delays occur as necessary under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.113" offset="1643813">They say further that for the very practical reason, we must have a cut-off date.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.403" offset="1668995">There's an 1893 decision by this Court, the Thomas case cited in our brief where it says that the cut-off date as to interest is a necessary incident to the settlement of estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.712" offset="1714239">At some point, we must stop, compute all the obligations and pay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.997" offset="1735346">Now obviously, and for a third reason, if the obligations bear different rates of interest, it's unfair to let that interest accumulate after the petitioner's file.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.419" offset="1777037">It's unfair to the creditors whose claims bear a smaller rate of interest contractually.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.841" offset="1798771">If they do not bear a rate of interest but you award a rate of interest under some statute as the Government here appraised then the fellow who suffers is the general creditor who finds that where he thought he had some dividend, where he thought he'd received some return on the money he's lost, in fact he receives nothing because that money is consumed in post-petition interest paid the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.546" offset="1893543">We do not believe either the Government or the entire class of creditors of which the Government is only one party should receive that advantage over the unsecured creditors, and indeed Justice Black, in the Vanston Bondholders case which we've quoted at some length at various places on our brief says that interest itself is a penalty on creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.615" offset="1977866">And it's a penalty we submit to the Court without any fault on the creditor's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.359" offset="1996779">They suffered the burden as the question has just indicated, not the trustee from this delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.042" offset="2023528">And then alluding again to the Saper case, the 1949 decision which must constitute the backbone of my argument to Your Honors today, the Saper case pointed out that the Bankruptcy Act sought to equate the Government as a participant in Bankruptcy proceedings with other creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.474" offset="2097298">That since the Government was a party to them, the Government must abide by the same rules and I submit that the Government, since Your Honors' pronouncement on the Spears case, I believe to be a warning that the Government must protect itself and avail itself from the statutory procedures at its command.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.727" offset="2166262">And I hope by the time I reserve for closing, I can emphasize that point again if it requires emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.246" offset="2192384">At any rate the Saper case said that tax claims were the same as other claims and that there was a pattern of distribution prescribed by the Bankruptcy Act that that pattern of distribution should not be varied by other federal legislation in other fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.901" offset="2258944">Where there was a tendency in all the cases as we have cited them, a great many of the cases to find independent internal revenue regulations and to try to give those equality with or priority over a bankruptcy petition or Bankruptcy Act provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.119" offset="2331878">Now, we submit to Your Honors that since the Saper case which did set up the rule that there'd be no post-petition interest, there has been a constant effort on the part of secured creditors and the Government to emasculate the Saper rule, to try to carve out exceptions to it which should have the effect of eating it up without belaboring those points, they're treated in the brief, but they're the type of situations where the estate proves to be solved then obviously interest should be given, the situation where the security itself produces substantial income.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.976" offset="2451310">Then in that situation, the creditor who has that security should receive its benefit because the unsecured creditor behind him suffers no loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.716" offset="2494255">We believe that each of those arguments is equally applicable here where the interest that is sought is against the general estate because of the failure of the debtor, its antagonist, we submit, to withhold the monies or return over the monies that it was required by statute to withhold and account for.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.500" offset="2585370">We believe that the Government in the case at hand and were successful before the Fifth Circuit is attempting to create an exception in which it visits the vicarious liability on an innocent party, the unsecured creditor that stands behind the Government or the tax creditor who stands in the same -- on the same plane with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.506" offset="2669380">And we believe that the Government by attempting to create a vicarious liability on that trustee which is the door into the general estate threatens to secure to itself an unwanted advantage, an advantage that it does not need if it tends to its own bankruptcy affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.752" offset="2742418">And that by doing so, it threatens seriously the whole fabric of bankruptcy administration; a fabric which the Saper case says provides an orderly rule of administration which should not be ordered because of internal revenue statutes which might be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.627" offset="2817860">And we must say to Your Honors, we find nothing that would directly conflict --</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.264" offset="4992397">If he fails to pass and delays paying it, he pays interest which comes out of the pocket of his general estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.014" offset="5031476">Now, let me say with respect to the penalties that Your Honors have asked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.073" offset="5059688">In the first place, I consider and I believe that there were several decisions of this Court which say that interest is itself a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.383" offset="5088946">The trustee has been penalized because he did not return these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.990" offset="5103365">We find the only obligation in the statutes for our trustee to make a tax return to relate to income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.793" offset="5130533">We do not find any statutory duty for him to return any taxes on behalf of this defaulting debtor in possession who is, we submit to Your Honors, a violent antagonist of the creditor's man of trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.157" offset="5179956">And we don't believe that the creditor should be visited in this particular case with these defalcations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.610" offset="5201795">We find that the only case which the Government seems to rely on is the Boteler case, a decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.167" offset="5220080">But we find that the Boteler case simply took a trustee who hadn't himself paid some California estate taxes on his own operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.664" offset="5258010">And because he didn't pay them, they penalized him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.807" offset="5266578">But this is not our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.848" offset="5270758">The Government seeks to penalize our general estate, our trustee for the shortcomings of his predecessor, debtor in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.264" offset="5300433">This, we submit, cannot be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.396" offset="5309001">We further submit that the Government's other basis for this is judicial code Section 960 set out in the briefs and that particular section says only that an operating trustee must pay federal and estate taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.210" offset="5388204">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.098" offset="5407744">Before answering directly the argument which counsel has made that the Government's position is unfair and clearly inequitable, I think it's important to make very clear the period with which we're dealing the nature and character of the tax since which formed the basis of this dispute and to consider some of the tax collection statutes which are applicable in this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.133" offset="5523937">Now, the Debtor in Possession here operated the business from August 5th, 1958, the date on which the petition was filed, that is the petition for an arrangement to September 17, 1958 when he was adjudicated as bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.131" offset="5591855">The taxes which formed the basis of this dispute were incurred during this period while the Debtor in Possession was operating the business under the provision of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.231" offset="5640338">We think this is important because what counsel is actually asking this Court to do is to extend the rule relating to penalties and interests incurred during the prebankruptcy with respect to prebankruptcy claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.169" offset="5708048">He is asking the Court to extend that rule to penalties and interests which are incurred after the bankruptcy occurs, after the business has been placed under the supervision of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.532" offset="5761546">Now, the taxes which formed the basis of this dispute fall into four general categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.826" offset="5786728">First, the income tax withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.090" offset="5799685">The Debtor in Possession employed certain employees and subtracted from their wages, wages which he would otherwise and have to pay them, the amount of the tax -- the income tax which he was supposed to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.126" offset="5851826">Now, as a result of that withholding, the employees received the credit for the income tax and could in fact have received a refund even though that money never found its way to the treasury department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.869" offset="5902817">The same thing is true with respect to the social security taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.960" offset="5919222">Now as to the cabaret tax, the tax worked like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.487" offset="5933328">The customer went into the cabaret and had a bill, let's say for $20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.512" offset="5953390">The statute laid a tax of 20% which meant that $4 was then added to the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.929" offset="5979094">Now, this $4 never really became any asset of the operator of the cabaret because it was always, if it fell in the place to which it was truly destined, it was always earmarked for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.034" offset="6035519">These are the bulk of the taxes which are here in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.427" offset="6049102">In addition, there were the employer share of the social security taxes and the unemployment compensation tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.221" offset="6080240">Now, substantial part of the revenue which is collected by the federal government comes from withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.621" offset="6113886">And very substantial sums are in the hands of men who operate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.264" offset="6140426">Congress accordingly has adopted extraordinary measures to see that these taxes are collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.590" offset="6165713">Now, the basic theory of the collection of these taxes is that the employer or the operator of the business simply serves as a conduit of those taxes to the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.347" offset="6216808">Even though he has a conduit, he has made personally liable however and becomes subjected to penalties and interest in appropriate circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.310" offset="6252648">The purpose of imposing the personal liability as to permit the use of the summary collection procedures which are applicable with respect to other taxes, but more important, with respect to this controversy which is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.690" offset="6310118">Section 7501 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that any person who collects or withholds a tax and that money has to be paid over to the federal government, the amount of the tax so collected and these were the words of the statute, the amount of the tax so collected or withheld shall be a special fund in trust for the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.635" offset="6861928">And so the idea of paying interest following a petition in bankruptcy is not as far as his counsel would have us -- have us believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.128" offset="6899858">Now we believe that the answer to the question which is before the Court has been given by Congress in very explicit terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.735" offset="6930265">Section 960 of the Judicial Code provides that any officers or agents conducting any business under authority of the United States Court shall be subject to our federal state and local taxes applicable to such business to the same extent as if it were conducted by an individual or corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.258" offset="7012394">Now, this statute was a subject to the decision written by this Court in 1941 in the case of Boteler versus Ingels which came out of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.414" offset="7049070">In this case, the State of California claimed a 100% penalty against the Trustee in Bankruptcy who is engaged in liquidating the assets of a bankrupt corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.705" offset="7098180">The bankrupt corporation had been engaged in the operating of a dairy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.039" offset="7123571">It operated trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.836" offset="7130676">The state license fee was due on January 1st, 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.758" offset="7150425">It was not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.805" offset="7154604">The trucks were sold on February 27th, 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.679" offset="7174040">The State of California claimed a 100% penalty because those license fees had not been paid on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.360" offset="7216776">The trustee offered the State the amount of the registration fees at the time the trucks were sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.711" offset="7250213">The State insisted upon the penalty and this Court upheld the imposition of the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.351" offset="7268812">The trustee there made precisely the same argument which the trustee is making here, namely, that penalties against prebankrupt claims were not allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.538" offset="7317504">Therefore, these claims were not allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.757" offset="7326386">This Court rejected that contention and held at Section 57(j) of the Bankruptcy Act did not prevent the imposition of penalties against the Trustee in Bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.491" offset="7377377">The Court with respect to Section 960 says that Congress has here declared with vigor and clarity that a trustee who operates a business must do so subject to the state tax the same as it had business who were owned by an individual or corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.908" offset="7446967">Now, this -- this has been a landmark decision in the bankruptcy area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1847.198" offset="7492211">If a private individual or corporation is subject to the tax, then the trustee operating the business would be subject to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.239" offset="7528364">Now, counsel says that the trustee here did not operate the business, but the Debtor in Possession did operate the business and the Debtor in Possession is an officer of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.037" offset="7571519">The debtor in possession is an agent of the Court, he files clearly within this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.588" offset="10273729">One way to -- one way to do that, of course, would be to have a condition specifically stated in the order authorizing the payment to the effect that it is paid to the Internal Revenue Service on condition that it will be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.584" offset="10329736">The revenue service maintains the expense accounts in many circumstances where there have been conditional payments of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.771" offset="10358471">So I think that the -- the risk of paying the Government would be just about as little as it would be possible to have any situation like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.418" offset="10400998">We think that if you look at the Boteler versus Ingels that you have here a standard which has been laid down by this Court, by Congress to the effect that in determining whether or not a liability is to be paid and when it is to be paid, you treat a trustee in bankruptcy even though he succeeds a debtor in possession in exactly the same light as you would that if it were a private individual or corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.754" offset="10534431">Now, as to the Saper case relied upon so heavily by counsel, let me point out that this case involved claims which were incurred prior to the adjudication of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.534" offset="10585527">An interest was claimed by the Government on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.326" offset="10596707">The Court there pointed out that it was historical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.009" offset="10611440">That there was a cut-off point and that after the cut-off point interest it was not paid on any claims which were outstanding against a bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.269" offset="10656475">And the Court explained that it would be unfair because of the varying rates of interest to allow interest against creditors in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.202" offset="10708198">The Court was concerned with the effect of the 1926 and 1938 Acts amending the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.769" offset="10742471">Under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, taxes were given an absolute priority and they carried interest until they were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.685" offset="10778102">Under the 1926 Act, the taxes were concerned to a fourth priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.499" offset="10801403">The Chandler Act of 1938 provided in Section 57(n) that the Government should be required to file a proof of claim just like other debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.211" offset="10844244">The Court concluded that the purpose of this legislation was to assimilate tax debts to other debts, and prebankruptcy interest was not allowable on other debts therefore it was not allowable on tax debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.352" offset="10896802">But it's interesting to note that the opinion says nothing about Section 960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.129" offset="10919894">It says nothing about Boteler versus Ingels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.105" offset="10931806">It says nothing about the administration expense either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.167" offset="10948002">We believe that it has absolutely no applicability when you start dealing with the administration expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.754" offset="10990425">The reasoning of the opinion simply doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.670" offset="11006098">We contend that it would be inequitable and unfair to allow a trustee in bankruptcy as this one has apparently done, to keep the money which under the trust fund theory actually belongs to the United States if --</text>

            <text syncTime="2759.977" offset="11143293">And before the 30 days is up, there is a straight bankruptcy if there's adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.726" offset="12178265">Further, I say to Mr. Justice White who I believe asked the question on Mr. Featherston whether or not a turnover order could have been brought and a proof of claim framed along the line of this were trust fund to have the funds turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.424" offset="12241063">Mr. Featherston's answer, as I recall it, was that it may very well have been possible that there was no money there at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.114" offset="12263842">And I think if Your Honors will look at the record you will see that the government claim was filed in 1963 and that from 1961 on the trustee had in his possession the $8,842.13 that Mr. Featherston spoke to Your Honors about.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Gunn</label>
            <text syncTime="3167.835" offset="12774693">No sir, I don't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.961" offset="12779186">I say that this man is not -- I'm apprehensive that this man jeopardizes the loan itself in a debtor in possession situation because he can only recover back in aliquot portion of what remained after the liquidating bankruptcy expenses are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.729" offset="12826311">I say the very loan itself is peerless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.416" offset="12837073">Then I say that interest is a matter of second regard there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.435" offset="12849089">And yes indeed, I believe that unless there's a court order collateralizing this man and certainly assuring that if he's interested up until the date of adjudication or confirmation whichever occurs and after working the case of confirmation, that the loan is very risky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.515" offset="12909484">Now, may I say so that I didn't believe that the trust fund argument was going to come up because I understood the Government to say that they were abandoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.711" offset="12938219">Clearly, the trust fund argument has no application or whatsoever to interest collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.580" offset="12957654">And it has no application whatsoever to penalty funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.712" offset="12970193">And I don't think if there's no raise involved or if the raise has been dissipated, that there's any possibility of it applying to the situations that we're concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.853" offset="13018781">I want -- but my last point to say that the Boteler case clearly involves the case where the trustee himself operated the vehicles on the highway of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.390" offset="13072906">It did not involve a situation where the trustee had to respond for the Debtor in Possessions operating the vehicles on the California highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.866" offset="13102791">I think in fact this California statute has contrasted with the federal statute makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.910" offset="13123062">Now lastly, may I say that it is my hope or our hope in presenting this case that we can encourage the Government which is deriving considerable revenue from bankruptcy situations to be in and to start in this situation so that they are participants when the question of loans or advances or payments on tax accounts can be made so that they can ask the referee to compel the trust -- to compel the Debtor in Possession to post an adequate indemnity bond to prevent just what has occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.787" offset="13258480">They can ask the trustee for payment and if he refuses and there's money available ask the referee for an order directing his payments then and seek the relief at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.973" offset="13295261">I do not believe the Government having great statutory privileges in this situation can sit back, rest on their position, and subsequently seek to penalize the general estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.000" offset="13339355">And we submit to those reasons the Fifth Circuit should be reversed.</text>
