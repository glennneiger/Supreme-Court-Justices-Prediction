            <label>Mr. Clarence Walker</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.413" offset="165073">This case is here on certiorari to review the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals' affirmation of a judgment entered by United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee against the United Mine -- international union -- United Mine Workers of America in the amount of $75,000 in favor of Paul Gibbs, an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.553" offset="289625">It was alleged that the United Mine Workers had violated Section 303 of the Taft-Hartley Act and of the common law of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.903" offset="334973">The basic facts of this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.946" offset="355140">Almost all of the coal lands in this mountainous area of Southern Tennessee is either owned or controlled by two major corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.373" offset="392861">One is the Tennessee Products and Chemical Company, the other is the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.014" offset="423476">Each of these corporations operated to -- operated a large mine and each subcontracted or subleased other small truck mines on their land and they purchased the coal and then sold it mainly to the TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.477" offset="505292">And almost all if not all of the mines on -- in this area, on the lands of these two corporations was under contract with the United Mine Workers of America and had been for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.927" offset="563075">In the spring of 1960 the con -- Tennessee Consolidated canceled its contract with UMWA or that covered its large mine, it's Coal Valley Mine that it operated itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.888" offset="630888">It sought then from UMW economic concessions and I think they describe it as a contract that they could live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.072" offset="663698">These negotiations proved fruitful -- did not proved fruitful and the mine shutdown in March 15, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.390" offset="712913">It had been apparent for a number of years that this Coal Valley Mine was working out and that they would have to make a new opening some place on their land and the Tennessee Consolidated officials had promised their old line employees that when they moved to a new area which was called the Gray's Creek area, that they would receive this employment, but failing in obtaining a new contract, Consolidated did something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.074" offset="835688">They formed a -- the Grundy Mining Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary and placed in charge of that corporation its attorney and labor adviser, a man named of Justin Harwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.969" offset="887202">The other officers of the Grundy Mining Corporation were the officers of the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.012" offset="915414">Mr. Harwood then contacted the Southern Labor Union that operated in Northern Tennessee and a rival union to the United Mine Workers of America, after ascertaining that that contract would be satisfactory to Tennessee Consolidated and Grundy and that ascertaining that the Southern Labor Union would recruit miners or replacements to go to work in this new Gray's Creek area, he then contacted Paul Gibbs, the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.642" offset="1057938">Paul Gibbs had operated several coal mines, not on Tennessee Consolidated land but on the -- its competitor, the Tennessee Products and Chemical Company, two small truck mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.289" offset="1112482">Gibbs also operated a fleet of eight trucks which he hauled the coal from his mine and from other mines in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.812" offset="1146650">So on August the 12th, on the evening of August the 12th, Harwood called Mr. Gibbs and offered him a job as mine superintendent of these new mines that Grundy intended to open up in the Gray's Creek area at the rate of $600 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.643" offset="1217912">In addition to that, he offered them a job at Mr. Gibbs' suggestion to haul coal from this mine at the rate of 78 cents per ton and this was agreed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.573" offset="1269635">And Mr. Harwood then informed Gibbs that they would have employees in this Gray's Creek area on Monday morning and they were then to start opening these new mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.032" offset="1323551">Over the weekend, all of these was unbeknownst to the old Coal Valley employees or to the United Mine Workers of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.566" offset="1357615">And over the weekend after the telephone conversation, the word got out or at least rumors that Consolidated intended to open the new mines in the Gray's Creek area.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.217" offset="1404217">And on Sunday, UMW's Local Union 5881 held a special meeting in which these matters were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.724" offset="1446222">And from that meeting, several of the members decided to go to the Gray's Creek area on Monday morning to determine whether the rumors were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.081" offset="1491675">The International Union or District 19 of the United Mine Workers representative in this area was named George Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.102" offset="1523754">George Gilbert left Southern Tennessee to go to Middlesboro, Kentucky on Saturday to attend an executive board meeting of District 19 and did not know anything about these events.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.490" offset="1581328">On Monday morning Mr. Gibbs showed up early.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.482" offset="1593344">There he -- but there were no employees there.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.345" offset="1608704">The three members of this Local Union arrived and they inquired from Mr. Gibbs of whether or not this Gray's Creek area was to be opened up.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.664" offset="1646007">And he did -- he said that it was his understanding that it was or he heard something to that effect, but the recruited replacements or the -- that were to come in or take these jobs had lost their way.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.063" offset="1703581">So they didn't show up and so Mr. Gibbs left.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.226" offset="1716328">Later on, a few of them got near there and finding Mr. Gibbs wasn't there, why they also departed.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.542" offset="1757497">But Johnny Cane who was a field worker for Southern Labor Union met a group of men that he claimed are from Fort Aid, that he said that some of them were armed with shotguns, some place along the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.135" offset="1811937">And he asked them if they were employees of the Grundy Mining Company and find out -- finding out that they weren't, he turned around and left.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.706" offset="1842239">But on Tuesday morning which is August the 16th, there was a much larger group there.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.741" offset="1862301">And when -- and which consisted of the old Coal Valley employees and members of Local 5881.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.107" offset="1891767">And when Mr. Gibbs arrived there, he testified that a large number of these men were armed and there were shotguns or rifles.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.427" offset="1929070">And that they told him to get out of his truck and he says that one of them put his hand on him and that he got out and they stood around for a while and he was apprehensive that he might be in physical danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.240" offset="1980374">And during this time they also stole or took from Mr. Gibbs his gun or took it from his truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.921" offset="2011094">Then they left this area, the Gray's Creek area and moved out this mountainous road which is the Pocket Road where after they'd gone a short distance, they ran into a larger group of men.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.905" offset="2175039">I think it has to do with the object of the picketing which is involved here and it has to do with the tie-in on the question of preemption because these employees that were there and told the other replacements that what -- that these jobs had been promised them and what they were doing there was picketing this plant if you call it -- these mines, if you call it picketing in order for them to get the jobs and I think it also goes into a determination of union responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.787" offset="2578474">Then around noon, a mine committee man called Middlesboro, Kentucky, the District 19 officials and then informed them that the mine, the Gray's Creek area was about to open up.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.883" offset="2630928">And that there had been picketing there and there were replacements to take their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.562" offset="2653602">District 19 officials then instructed George Gilbert to return to Southern Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.839" offset="2678680">And also instructed him that he was to see that there be no violence, that if there was picketing that that picketing be limited in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.375" offset="2716923">And also to ensure that the picketing be conducted in such a way that it did not interfere with any of the other mining operations in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.208" offset="2764152">And George Gilbert did return to Southern Tennessee on the evening of August the 16th and after several days, he was able to accomplish this and there was picketing at the intersection of the Pocket Road in the main highway for a period of eight and a half months by the three to five employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.983" offset="2859342">None of the other mining operations were affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.961" offset="2871254">The employees and the members of the United Mine Workers continued to cross the picket line including the employees of Mr. Gibbs that were working in his mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.570" offset="2925693">Several of the operators testified, the small operators testified that after this period of time, George Gilbert told them and also Gibbs that they did not intend or the words to the affect for the Southern Labor Union to come in to this field or intend to have Mr. Gibbs bring the Southern Labor Union into this field.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.447" offset="3053171">There is testimony which is referred to in the opinion of the Circuit Court that in the city or in the town of Palmer, which is small Palmer -- a small town, there was a large gathering of men around the company store which included members of the United Mine Workers and also officials of the Tennessee Consolidated Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.307" offset="3144600">And that they made threats to the officials of Tennessee Consolidated, two officers of the Tennessee Consolidated and Grundy and that some of them were armed.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.954" offset="3191202">And particularly the one that grabbed a hold of one of the officers, a man named Gary, but the Court of Appeals noting that some of these were members ignored the fact that this had nothing to do with the dispute with Gibbs, that this man, Gary, thought that he was being accused of stealing from the company warehouse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.299" offset="6480541">We find and that the evidence of -- that the Court relied upon in that respect was that Mr. Gibbs testified that, "I am thinking that I saw George Gilbert in the Gray's Creek area on the 15th or 16th of August, but he didn't take part in any of these activities that we relate here as unlawful or that his car was there."</text>

            <text syncTime="6834.412" offset="27440985">Now the -- there was no ratification by conduct that the Labor Board found contemptuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="6841.188" offset="27468152">This contempt of the Labor Board order was after this case was even tried so that the conduct there did not even involved Gibbs and could not be considered as ratification of the conduct in Gibbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.895" offset="27530951">Now there was a Labor Board complaint and a board order against Local 5881, a cease and desist order alleging that that local union but not the International Union and not District 19 had violated Section 8 (b) 1 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="6876.735" offset="27610363">And that there was later – by later conduct they held that the local union had contempt of the action but not in relation to the Gibbs incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="6888.054" offset="27655607">And I want to refer to the testimony of this man's quote, the man who testified that he found Gibb or Gilbert along the road but he was not picketing, that he found him and he came out of the woods and asked directions to a coal mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.275" offset="27716524">He said, “No, you can't go this way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6905.180" offset="27724048">He was not telling you can't go down this road we're picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6909.565" offset="27741602">But he was asking the direction to another coal mine and he said, “You can't get there that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6914.131" offset="27759888">You have to get down here to another road” and he said, “You'll find some of my men there,” I think he referred to him and tell him, “I said that you can go on through” and I don't think form that fact that a representative calls the members or people down there or tell him my men that that constitutes these men are picketing on behalf of the United Mine Workers of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="6937.610" offset="27853824">Particularly these people are employees, he started of this picketing in their own individual capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6945.693" offset="27886111">Then it was -- the point was raised about action regarding George Ramsey, another coal operator and Howard Hueman, and Woody Travis who represented the Tennessee Products and Chemical Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6959.818" offset="27942640">Now we didn't loose every point down in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6962.911" offset="27954970">We got a directed verdict on that point and never went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6967.332" offset="27972733">And they withdrew all of that evidence from the jury because they alleged the secondary boycott involving those companies which was completely separate cause of action and for which he offered no proof of what he alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="6981.634" offset="28029889">So that cannot be the basis of finding liability by UMWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="6989.089" offset="28059773">The second thing is that all of the employees, the replacement employees left before the conversation, the telephone conversation that Gibbs had with Gilbert which Gilbert said to the effect, “We don't want you to bring in the Southern Labor Union in here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7006.335" offset="28128737">And that conversation had nothing to do with these employees not coming in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="7011.758" offset="28150366">Of course any labor union in America would resent them bringing in another labor union or bringing in replacement of these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.326" offset="28204701">Then the -- it raised the point and the Court referred to this about that there was smoke in one of Mr. Gibbs' mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="7032.934" offset="28235107">What that testimony is that one of the employees who testified on our behalf said that a man running, holding the coal out said that a rag caught on fire and he took the rag out and so there was no trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="7047.514" offset="28293413">That was the smoke incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="7049.184" offset="28300100">Nothing had anything to do with the Gibbs' incident with Grundy or the employment in Grundy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7054.194" offset="28320162">And another time, they didn't even know when this was.</text>
            <text syncTime="7056.499" offset="28329357">They said that the belt was cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="7059.675" offset="28342105">There is no evidence to how it was cut, why it was cut, were those accidental, or what was involved, or even the time that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7068.646" offset="28377945">And so that had nothing to do with the sense of -- list thing -- reason I didn't mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7073.576" offset="28397693">Now on the question of the application of Section 6, the Patent case was cited.</text>
