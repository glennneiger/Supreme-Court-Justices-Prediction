            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="51.407" offset="308955">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.839" offset="322748">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.634" offset="345945">The Court of Appeals set aside an order of the Federal Trade Commission which had directed the Borden Company to cease discriminating in price between competing purchasers in a case which arose out of the sales of evaporated milk, allegedly in violation of Section 2 (a) of the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.510" offset="437373">It's pertinent here that Section 2 (a) makes it unlawful to discriminate in price between purchasers of commodities “of like grade and quality” where the effect maybe substantially to lessen competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.361" offset="504769">The Borden Company sells milk, evaporated milk under the well known Borden brands all over the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.329" offset="544684">It also sells evaporated milk to certain customers under the brands of the labels of those customers referred to in this record as private label milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.557" offset="585644">Physically, the milk in each instance was identical both the milk itself and the containers and the question presented is whether the Borden label milk and the private label milk are to be considered commodities of like grade and quality within the meaning of Section 2 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="142.930" offset="675088">The question arose very briefly in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.304" offset="684596">The Commission held that because the goods were physically identical, they were like grade and quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.840" offset="710719">It went on to find discrimination and injury and price between the customers for Borden and the customers for the private label milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.613" offset="765785">It concluded that the two-price system may have the effect substantially less than competition both at the primary line that is vis à vis the competitors of Borden, packers of milk and at the secondary line that is wholesale and retail customers for the Borden milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.301" offset="852616">Now, those findings are not an issue here because the court below did not reach them.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.330" offset="868707">We're not asking for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.600" offset="877798">I think whatever it is useful to put the legal issue in context to review just generally the basis for those conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.573" offset="905697">The Commission noted at the primary line level that there had been a decline generally in the evaporated milk sales throughout the industry, that 10 producers largely in the Midwest area had dropped out of this business since 1950 that there had been no new entrants and that in the circumstances, there was a little need to ship the competitive balance between competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.777" offset="1010500">It said that Borden was a large and powerful concern compared to its competitors and if the price structure which it was utilizing had placed a severe strain on small competitors, one it going out of business and all the others lost large and important accounts on a permanent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.894" offset="1078941">They found finally in this market setting that there was a clear threat to the entire Midwest competition if the discrimination were to be continued, and that the elimination or serious impairment of competition was likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.892" offset="1142888">At the secondary line, the Commission found that there was large price differences between the competing customers, one in particularly to the Columbia, South Carolina area which is an area close to one of the Borden plants since Borden sold the private label milk at an FOB plant price whereas it sold the Borden brand milk at a delivered price, uniform throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.381" offset="1252916">Now this in compared prices around the Borden plant, the Court -- the Commission found that there was a large discrepancy among customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.496" offset="1289383">They found that there was a low or nonexistent profit margin in the sale of evaporated milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.648" offset="1313938">It was largely handled by distributors as an accommodation and often used as a loss leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.326" offset="1344658">It found that the effect of the -- of the discrimination was therefore to draw customers away not only with respect to evaporated milk but also with respect to other items handled by the wholesalers and retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.292" offset="1396590">It pointed a testimony that a price such as that which Borden offered with the private label milk would have been a great aid to the wholesalers and retailers in meeting their competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.026" offset="1443506">It should have on these points and Borden says that it never refused to sell private label milk to any customer so long as it had productive capacity available, and that is not disputed in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.431" offset="1493138">But it is also undisputed however that Borden did not disclose the availability of the private label milk to all of its Borden plant customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.607" offset="1537755">It -- at page 741 of the record, there's an exhibit which is a letter from Borden's merchandizing manager for evaporated milk in which he instructs the Atlanta office of Borden that brokers are not to discuss the terms of private label milk sales with customers and that all inquiries are to be referred to the home office.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.301" offset="1640573">And at page 826 of the record is a another letter sent out by the Borden Merchandizing Manager in which he says and this is at page 827, “We are in a position to take on a few more selected accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.711" offset="1714239">Naturally, we prefer to deal with the best and the ones that can do us the most good.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.348" offset="1732733">We certainly don't want to end up by soliciting a bunch of peanut accounts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="412.016" offset="1751437">Now, the Commission went on to reject the cost justification which Borden had offered on the basis of an accounting analysis and that also is not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.550" offset="1805563">I would say that this case was very much likely in Anheuser-Busch case, at 363 U.S. because the court below here did not reach either the injury to competition or the cost justification, or even the form of the order that all of these points were raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.467" offset="1869197">What the Court did was to foreclose the inquiry at the threshold issue of whether the goods were of like grade and quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.828" offset="1910680">We think this is very much like Anheuser-Busch because there the question was whether or not there was a discrimination in price?</text>
            <text syncTime="458.270" offset="1936488">The Court said that that was a threshold issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.505" offset="1949341">That there was no -- there were no over tones of business backordering out of the conclusion of the discrimination in price and that the -- it was in fact a non directive phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.201" offset="2000227">Now, we're really dealing here with the other half of that phrase because the conclusion that the goods are of like grade and quality, simply leads to the conclusion that there is discrimination in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.095" offset="2047770">The questions of injury to competition and the cost justification defenses which we contend think are the important issues for this case on its facts are over beyond this threshold issue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="506.743" offset="2130317">Exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.519" offset="2141497">We think however that this is also an important case for the Commission because without the finding of discrimination -- without the ability to find discrimination in a situation where you have a private label milk and an advertised milk, the Commission has foreclosed on the inquiry into the question of whether or not there is in fact injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.725" offset="2230314">But I think when I talk about the legislative history, it become apparent, this was not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.831" offset="2262706">Indeed, we think that in order to appraise the decision properly, the Court should assume that there is forbidden injury to competition here because the -- as I say the Commission found it and the Court of Appeals did not reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.537" offset="2325504">On the narrow issue as to whether or not that goods of like grade and quality, there is no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.104" offset="2347760">The goods are physically identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.079" offset="2355702">Goods or the milk is packed according to the Borden standards irrespective of whether it's sold as private label or Borden brand milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.906" offset="2391019">It's printed exactly identical cans except for the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.007" offset="2415365">The Court of Appeals found that there was an intense public demand, however, for the Borden brand milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.191" offset="2444100">It noted that the Borden brand milk commands a higher price at all levels of distribution, that it is well advertised and promoted and that there is a testimony that the Borden brand -- Borden name does command great deal of consumer respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.343" offset="2512750">Borden advertises it very extensively and it has the necessary consequences or at least the believed consequences of advertising that it is accepted by consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.393" offset="2556949">Now the reasoning of the Court of Appeals here was that when the labels are proven to have demonstrable, commercial significance, they “change the grade of a product.”</text>
            <text syncTime="627.399" offset="2612955">It found that the label here had premium market value and commercial significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.336" offset="2640750">It believed that Congress could not have intended that consumer preferences be ignored in determining when products maybe priced differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.573" offset="2677635">It believed the Court concluded that in order to avoid price uniformity which would be in conflict with the general policies of the antitrust laws that it must necessarily recognize promotional values under the expression of like grade and quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.520" offset="2753494">The Court did not focus on the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.665" offset="2766033">It found no help in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.698" offset="2778154">It pointed to no controlling of the case and indeed there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.039" offset="2795499">It believed that the administrative precedents were distinguishable and indeed, it found a conflict between the Commission's approached under the protection with the Section 2(b) defense that is the good faith meeting of competition defense with its approach to this case and our position briefly is that the Court was in error on virtually every one of those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.648" offset="2898004">First, we think that the language is quite clearly in -- quite clearly supports the Commission's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.277" offset="2928515">That when you look at the legislative history, you find indeed that Congress did have this problem presented to it and it rejected the opportunity to do what the Court of Appeals here did.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.265" offset="2984417">Third, we think that the choice which Congress exercised makes good sense because it prevents foreclosing the inquiry before we reach the important questions to whether or not competition is injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.891" offset="3042931">And finally, we think that this construction which the Commission advanced in this case is a view that it has held consistently since 1936 to change it now in our view would open the very dangerous that Congress was afraid of when it refused to make an allowance for brands when it passed the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.908" offset="3131016">And in the absence of some record that the Commission's construction to which it has adhered since 1936 and caused some kind of economic harm we think that that construction should be given great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.130" offset="3183888">Turning first to the language which we do not argue is necessarily decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.074" offset="3207711">We think nevertheless it clearly supports us.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.365" offset="3224848">The whole notion of greater quality it seems to us is in conflict with the idea of promotional values because promotional values may very well reflect an erroneous review of the products' physical attributes and the Commission thinks that grade and quality means physical attributes.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.966" offset="3303215">I think that we took an example, if I had two cans of milk here and they were perfectly identical and that's all we knew about them and I asked whether they were like grade and quality, I think it would be unanimously responded but of course they were of like grade and quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.744" offset="3370297">If knowing just that and nothing more, I then added a label to one which said Borden and to the other which said Smiths and we were told that consumers were willing to pay more for the Borden can of milk, I think the reaction would be not that the Borden milk is of higher grade and quality but that the consumers are under misapprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.403" offset="3468936">They don't understand that physically they are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.015" offset="3479385">And Borden put in the record a survey which it conducted at page 24 and 25 of Volume 1 of the record and housewives were asked for why they -- for reasons as to why they preferred the Borden brand and if you look at those reasons, you see that they are almost unanimously physical attributes.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.969" offset="3567261">They thought it was creamier, but it didn't have a can of taste, that it didn't sour, that they liked the flavor better, one said it was heavier, and one said it was lighter, one said it was thick and it didn't have a canny taste.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.664" offset="3634030">Now, these are all physical attributes and what Borden is in effect asking here what the Court of Appeals rule is that we make a circle through the consumer's misapprehension that there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.349" offset="3692753">We are now to conclude that this changes the grade and quality and that --</text>

            <text syncTime="930.301" offset="3824619">And that Borden doesn't presume to exercise any such marketing control over it's -- over the brand name product -- I mean, over the trade name for the consumer's name product, but only over its own part Borden?</text>

            <text syncTime="945.266" offset="3884387">If that is correct then that is in effect of the confession of error because the Court of Appeals assumed that they were identical and what this is, is an argument that they are physically different, but as to the precise question as to what the record shows on it, the record shows that Borden's salesmen, it had some 200 retail representatives, who traveled around among the stores and offered this service turning the cans and looked over every 30 days or actually not I mean 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.918" offset="4015000">The testimony was that it needed to be done every 30 days that the salesmen got around anywhere from four to six weeks and did try to turn the cases over, tried to turn the cans of milk over to keep the milk from coagulating.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.518" offset="4105488">Those salesmen did not visit stores according to the testimony where the volume of sales did not worth their visiting stores and there is a testimony that at least in one district, that volume say the stores doing over $200,000 worth of business a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.344" offset="4176750">So that if there was a difference, if there was a difference in this milk, it only took place in those large and – stores and those large customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.571" offset="4217605">Furthermore, many of the chain stores according to the testimony would not let the salesmen in the stores at all so that that argument as to the difference in the milk as it actually reached the consumer pursuant to some Borden guarantee is only applicable, (a) to the large stores and (b) to the -- those chain stores where a Borden's representatives were permitted in a store and then I might add that it really is a confession of error because it means that the milk is different.(Voice Overlap)</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.384" offset="5148923">And in any event, Mr. Teegarden who had been the -- according to the legislative history, very clearly the draftsman of the proposed patent bill and who was counsel for the United States Wholesale Grocers Association, responded with the letter to the Committee in which he said, that to add the idea and the brands to the phrase “like grade and quality” would be to destroy the efficacy of the bill against large buyers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.794" offset="5282565">He said that under the bill as it stood, “sellers were still free to make private brands, but if they did so for one, they must be ready to do so on the same terms for everybody.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.837" offset="5330735">The manner then came up on the floor during the debate and we've quoted both this and the Teegarden letter in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.031" offset="5367515">The Teegarden letter is at pages 14 and 15 of our brief and the colloquy on the floor is at pages 13 and 14 of our brief and I'd like to read it, it's very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.879" offset="5418924">Mr. Taylor of South Carolina said, “There has grown up of practice on the part of manufacturers of making certain brands of goods for particular chain stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.234" offset="5456332">Is there anything in this bill calculated to remedy that situation?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.161" offset="5475976">Mr. Patman then said, “I have no time to discuss that feature, but the bill will protect the independent in that way because they will have to sell to the independents at the same price for the same product where they put the same quality of merchandise in a package and this will remedy the situation to which the gentleman refers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.158" offset="5563956">And Mr. Taylor of South Carolina then said, “Irrespective of the brand” and Mr. Patman said, “Yes, so long as it is in the same quality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.818" offset="5598647">Now at the minimum, that shows that Congress was aware of the distinction between brands and quality and in all of these passages, Congressman and the witnesses are talking about private label or other brand merchandises compared to the national advertised brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.093" offset="5687777">None of them suggests that nationally advertised brands would not be of like grade and quality with local or off brands or private label.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.021" offset="5731453">All of them are assuming that they will be treated alike under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.092" offset="5759770">Now, I would point out also that this congressional refusal to make special exception for brand differences makes pretty good sense and it should prevail even if the language and the legislative history were less clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.958" offset="5823195">First at the primary level that is competition with the seller, there is a clear possibility of use of private brands as what used to be called fighting brands, a practice of which the original 1914 Clayton Act was aimed, as well as the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.621" offset="5929880">All that needs to be done is that the seller puts out a quality product at a low price but calls it brand X where he wants to defeat his competitors, meanwhile, holding up the market for his well-known brand name by the heavy advertising which he has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.271" offset="6004485">At the secondary level which was the particular focus of the Robinson-Patman Act, it would be similarly easy to give in to the demands of large customers that they have a special brand made available to them while smaller customers who were unable to pressure the seller could be turned away.</text>

            <text syncTime="2117.625" offset="8573889">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.546" offset="8589563">My main point for which I argue today, if it please the Court, is that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case is fully consonant with the objective of the Robinson-Patman Act to protect against harmful use of the buying power of large purchasers and at the same time avoids the error of giving to the Act a reading which would have any competitive effects inconsistent with the basic antitrust policies laid down by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.128" offset="8743894">I think it's important at the outset that I was asking the Court to focus on three main points of facts about this case because they help to define just what the court below decided and help to lay aside matters which the court below did not decide and which not -- would not be involved in an affirmance of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.723" offset="8846294">The first of these points of facts and I don't believe there's any question about any of the uses between part, this dichotomy between the premium brands and private labels in the evaporated milk business is something that which has existed in the evaporated milk business for great many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.771" offset="8958412">It was not created by the Borden Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.784" offset="8970533">It didn't come into existence as a result of the prices complained of in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.032" offset="8991535">It was a situation which the Borden Company based as having been in existence for years when it was invited to supply private label milk to customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.587" offset="9045765">These premium brands Borden, Carnation, Pet offered on a national basis of having wide national demand, commanding a premium price in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.079" offset="9099682">And along side of those for years, had been the products of a number of manufacturers who have specialized in private label production in the Maine and they've packed milk for various wholesalers or retailers under the labels belonging to those wholesalers or retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.369" offset="9180871">These private labeled products were less acceptable to the public than the premium brands and if they were to be sold at all, it had to be sold at a lower price in the premium brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.659" offset="9234056">The record is perfectly clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.657" offset="9241997">The court below found that in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.111" offset="9255790">The wholesalers and retailers who were the customers of the private label or the premium brand packers knew that they would have to resell the product for a lesser price than they could resell the premium brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.718" offset="9326216">And therefore, they were only willing to buy them if they could get to them at a lesser price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.489" offset="9353279">The matter was summed up colorably if somewhat ungrammatically by one of the chief retailer witnesses for the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.442" offset="9389119">He said, “Private label is no good for nobody unless there's a price on it” and he went on to say that the differential in his experience has to be from $1.50 to $2.00 a case which by the way the hearing examiner found was greater than any differential involved in the Borden Company's pricing and he went on to say that the retailers in this area hadn't been much interested in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.382" offset="9516910">The point of this, may it please the Court, is that the premium brands where a standard item bought by virtually all grocers, the private labels were paralleling these at lower prices bought by some customers but not by all desired by some customers, but not desired by all, and the distinction between them was genuine and firmly rooted at all levels of this distribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.351" offset="10088782">A second matter of fact which I would like to bring to the Court's attention has to do with the suggestion that were made by Mr. Hummel that this preference of the consumers for Borden brand, the strong consumers preference were perhaps just all misapprehension on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.662" offset="10190033">I would not have the Court think that the standing of the Borden brand product in the marketplace and most particularly among the consumers because that's what governs here was something that was based simply on the work of Madison Avenue and the facts on these are very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.186" offset="10284074">For the many years that the Borden Company has been making and selling Borden brand evaporated milk, it has taken extensive and expensive steps to make sure that the product reaches the hands of the ultimate consumer in this nearly possible as possible perfect condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.383" offset="10376861">And they have done things in this regard which as a practical manner is not feasible for them to do with respect to private label milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.869" offset="10406849">Now, evaporated milk is perishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.904" offset="10434957">It cannot be kept too long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.453" offset="10449168">When it is stored, it must be kept in carefully controlled conditions as to temperature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.568" offset="10481664">If these things are not properly taken care of, the milk will become lumpy and stringy, crystals of mineral substance will form in the milk, color will turn, and it will be generally unacceptable to any user.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.782" offset="10570480">Now regard against these things, the Borden Company has taken a number of important steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.760" offset="10602454">First, it provides during the period of this record, the number was 15 cold storage warehouses at proper locations throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.326" offset="10648639">So that the milk can be kept under carefully controlled conditions and that doesn't mean under the same temperature everyday because as they move it nearer to the point of exit from the warehouse, the temperature has to be modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.649" offset="10713945">And this is an elaborate and painstaking operation to make sure that the milk is properly cared for while it is kept in storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.585" offset="10769742">Beyond that, the company operates under rigid requirements as to the time of shipment of milk that first packed first shipped is the rule and even though that means shipping milk across the country rather than shipping it from the nearest warehouse, that practice is followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.290" offset="10868485">The reason for that is that if that isn't done, milk will tend to be backed up in some warehouse and becomes stale or unusable for some reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.946" offset="10919163">And then when the milk has gotten into the hands of the -- the retail grocery, well theoretically, Borden has nothing more to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.134" offset="10959914">The company follows it there and these 200 men that Mr. Hummel referred to go into the stores, they check as to the age of the milk, on occasion they open cans to see what condition the milk is actually in, they check with the store rooms to make sure that the milk is rotated out in the store in the proper way so as to prevent it being backed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.766" offset="11074435">This isn't just turning cans over every 30 days, may it please the Court, it's vastly more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.058" offset="11103587">And these steps having been carried on for years, have given to the customers throughout the country assurance that when they buy a Borden brand milk, they're getting something that is in the same condition as nearly as possible in which it was when it was put into the can in effect.

            <text syncTime="3247.881" offset="13094849">As to the primary line, I just may comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.282" offset="13116479">The record shows that some of the private label packers in the Midwest lost some business to the Borden Company when it began packing private label at two of its plants in south, Chester, South Carolina and Lewisburg, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.106" offset="13203832">Customers located near those plants, who had been buying evaporated milk from firms out in Wisconsin and Kansas, found they could handle it much more cheaply from this plant that was near to their homes and they bought for Borden and really that's what started this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.648" offset="13294007">But the same statistic showed that these packers in the Midwest had picked up business from other sources too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.874" offset="13330892">And so, there were ups and downs as among them but in the Maine, the trend of their business was up during the period covered by the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.506" offset="13441442">The Commission found injury in both lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.534" offset="13461504">I want to say one more word on that sir, if I may, it asserted that one of these packers went out of business as a result of Borden Company's getting into the private label business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.625" offset="13517824">The difficulty with that proposition is that he was asked where his problems were and he stated them, and that is not what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.536" offset="13561501">He was located out of the line in the Midwest where the freight rates were adverse to him in the territory where he was trying to do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.913" offset="13602983">And he said his friends in Ohio, where is this other gentleman that the Government says were being injured, his friends in Ohio had been able to put their milk down in the east to get in more cheaply than he could and he found it very difficult so he got out of the evaporated milk business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.435" offset="13673096">And getting out of the evaporated milk business is not the testimony that getting out of business sometimes sounds like, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.458" offset="13709249">A milk processor has a number of different products that he can make, cottage cheese, powdered milk, ice cream mix, one thing and another and his choice of product to make from time to time would vary depending upon the amount of raw milk available in his neighborhood, on price conditions or these other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.440" offset="13813112">So the fact that people are in and out of the processing of some of these milk products is not -- does not signify that they are going out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.979" offset="13855326">It simply signifies that they're adjusting their operations so as to get do the things that they regard as the most profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.072" offset="13891688">Well as a result of this, if I may come back to this matter of the quality aspects, after packing, of course they're of the same quality when they're put in the can, there's no question about that, the Borden Company is unable to and does not seek to follow this private label milk through the channels of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.652" offset="13997955">And over the years, other private labeled packers have not been able to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.535" offset="14025540">And the consequence is that there cannot be the assurance that private label evaporated milk on the grocery shelves where the housewife buys, is as well cared for, is indeed in the same condition as it was in when it left the factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.703" offset="14094190">And the record shows that consumers have had unsatisfactory experiences with private label evaporated milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.759" offset="14130448">The survey which Mr. Hummel has referred to demonstrated that the list of reasons from which he read was the selection made by the hearing examiner.</text>

            <text syncTime="4532.298" offset="18232613">But his judicial views were widely read and he regarded the grade and quality as involving the concept of public acceptability and he so held in one of the cases cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.496" offset="18301367">It seems to me Your Honor that the principle point about the legislative history here and the one that I would like most to address myself too is the fact that Congress did not adopt this proposal to add the words ‘and brands' to the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.430" offset="18365106">As the bill then stood, it said that it referred to commodities of like grade and quality and the proposal was made to amend it by adding the words ‘and brands' and Mr. Teegarden wrote a letter which had put the Congress in the record in which he said that, “While at first blast this seems alright,” it really isn't and then he pointed out that each brand of the private label, it is -- there's just one for that owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.899" offset="18498957">And so if one made a private label for the A company and then another private label product for the B company, and then another private label for the great national C company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.737" offset="18574294">Under that proposal, there could be complete discrimination among those buyers and that would defeat the purposes of the Act because in actual economic market fact, in most situations, at least so far as evaporated milk is concerned, the private label market is one thing, the premium brand market is another, and things in the private label market tend to be equated with each other and the refusal of Congress to adopt that amendment, I submit, does not suggest that the decision of the court below is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.977" offset="18739284">The court below said it would not accept the view that any change in labels would make the difference as between grade and quality.</text>

            <text syncTime="5170.093" offset="20783731">One of the things about this maybe about the argument that the Court of Appeals,perhaps part of what you've said is that if we should adopt that definition of grade and quality and if by the same ordinance made a private label only for the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea company and Safeway and Kroger let's say and didn't make it available to anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.317" offset="20920613">If we adopted the idea of that commercial differentiation in market acceptability just by as a lower price for the private label product, there would be no way of reaching that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5262.138" offset="21151953">Now if a case arises in which Borden or somebody else, who make some special deals with the Grand Union or somebody, or if another Goodyear case arises, the Commission can deal with those without being in anyway cramped by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.785" offset="21230529">And the illustration of that is the case that is cited in our brief in this very Fifth Circuit not long before this case was argued there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.538" offset="21273475">They came down with a decision in a private triple damage action holding that two products were of like grade and quality, although, they bore different labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.774" offset="21330422">And the Commission said that that's just what we say and the Court had no difficulty at all with that and Judge Reeves who wrote the opinion, in that other case, who joined in the unanimous opinion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.321" offset="21380681">On the facts of this case, you've got a clear substantial, unquestioned differentiation in the market between these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.011" offset="21419447">You have in truth and in fact different products.</text>

            <text syncTime="5355.903" offset="21526967">The very fact that it picks out one or two big chains and makes a special deal with them it's almost that they'd give away that that is not the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.324" offset="21568658">And I have no doubt that the expertise of the Federal Trade Commission would enable them to deal with that situation very readily.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.612" offset="21609827">Well, if I may summarize for just a minute, the -- I would reassert that the decision of the Court of Appeals on the facts of this case is consonant with the objective of the Robinson-Patman Act and it is pro-competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5399.925" offset="21703032">The Borden Company has not discriminated at all as among the Borden brand customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.105" offset="21727796">There's no question about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5422.331" offset="21792684">Now a reversal, an announcement that the Borden Company could only engage in the distribution of private label milk at the peril of facing a Federal Trade Commission proceeding would be to say, “you'd better stratify this industry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.562" offset="21865618">Let the -- let the Borden, the premium brand producers stick to their daily rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5448.712" offset="21898219">Let the other stick to theirs and let's not have competition between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.945" offset="21923192">I submit to the Court that a decision which would have that implication ought not to be rendered unless it is clearly called for by the language and the objectives of the Robinson-Patman Act and I submit that it is not.</text>
