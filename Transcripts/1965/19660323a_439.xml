            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="49.935" offset="303104">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.419" offset="317001">This and case that follows come here from the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.367" offset="336854">They both involve an application of this Court's decision three terms ago in Bianchi versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.929" offset="375097">In that case, the basic thrust of that decision was that the determination of disputes arising out of government contract is primarily for the administrative boards from the various procuring agencies subject only to the same limited judicial review as is appropriate in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.846" offset="466735">The Court of Claims, it seems to us, has been knowing a way at that rule ever since it was enacted and it is for that reason that we ask the Court to take these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.050" offset="519607">The precise issue in my case is a very narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.064" offset="531623">It is whether factual issues arising under a government procurement contract or a construction contract in this case which concededly should have been resolved administratively, maybe decided in the first instance by the Court of Claims merely because the administrative board believing that the appeal to it was untimely, did not reach those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.138" offset="655966">The case arises under the following facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.200" offset="680208">Back in August of 1958, the Air Force issued invitation for bids to construct military housing in air force base in the Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.669" offset="742066">The successful bidder was the respondent, Anthony Grace &amp; Sons.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.320" offset="768606">Under the -- they were issued a letter of acceptability which is the formal way in which the agreement between the parties was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.436" offset="809148">Under the agreement then entered into, it was provided that wage determinations would be made by the Secretary of Labor and this construction was to be governed by the Davis-Becon Act because the wage determination though they're included in the documents might not be up to date, it was provided that new determinations would be sought by the contractor from the Secretary of Labor and that if there was a substantial variance in the new wage determination, an appropriate adjustment in the contract price would be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.405" offset="981034">It's also provided that the contractor make a deposit of $25,000 together with the [Inaudible] which respondent did and that, he should be ready to set a closing date that is to enter into the formal construction contract at a time specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.853" offset="1070791">It was further provided pursuant to what we label a disputes clause that in the event, the contractor defaulted in his obligations and failed to close, the government would be entitled to retain the $25,000 deposit and likewise recover actual damages over and above that amount he paid, and that this matter should be determined in the first instance by the contracting officer and then by the administrative board of the agency involved, in this case the Air Force which jointly with the other services has what is known as the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.011" offset="1283427">After the new wage determinations were made by the Secretary of Labor which did include an increase in wage rates for some of the construction --</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="308.997" offset="1339329">Labor involved in a construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.826" offset="1350719">It was raised to the position that there was not only a change in rates, but also a change in the area to which these higher rates were applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.669" offset="1398053">That disagreement was aired between the parties in correspondence to some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.288" offset="1424488">Ultimately, the Air Force contracting officer took the position that there had not been such a variance in the area to which the new higher rates were applicable and that accordingly the contractor was not entitled to an increase in the contract price on that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.081" offset="1515708">He therefore demanded Grace that it comply with the closing date and enter into the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.514" offset="1557400">Grace did not do so whereupon the contracting officer notified Grace that the agreement was canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.223" offset="1596270">20 days later, the contracting officer in response to a letter from Grace asking for a return of its deposit, informed Grace that the deposit was forfeit since the failure -- since the default was to be laid at the door of Grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.291" offset="1672547">At this point, Grace appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals, seeking a return of its deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.659" offset="1710059">The Board, however, viewed the appeal as untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.715" offset="1730226">We needn't discuss the reasons for that decision because it is no longer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.517" offset="1765439">Upon the ruling of the Board of Contract Appeals, Grace then sued out its claim in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.248" offset="1800338">The Court of Claims held that the appeal was timely, that the Board should have had the case on merits, that the government's motion for summary judgment predicated on the theory that in no event was the default justified even if the adjustment in the bid price might have been erroneously denied, was at least tentatively denied and the Court of Claims remanded the case to its trial commissioner, for trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.629" offset="1945893">Now, it's maybe helpful to isolate the questions as they were presented to the Court of Claims even though those questions were not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.675" offset="1990092">The government's first position was that Grace's claim in the court was barred because it did fail to exhaust his administrative remedies in that it had not timely appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.166" offset="2052054">As I have said, that position of the government was flatly rejected by the Court of Claims and we do not challenge the decision of the Court of Claims on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.717" offset="2098239">The Government's second position was that the claim stated no cause of action on which relief could be granted because in the circumstances, even if the failure to allow an increased price was unjustified, nevertheless Grace's proper recourse was to go to the Board not to default as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.635" offset="2197922">Again, the Court of Claims at least tentatively moved against the Government on this issue to deny the Government's motion for summary judgment which was in part predicated on that theory and again we did not petition from that decision of the Court of Claims and therefore do not challenge it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.930" offset="2291127">Now finally, and this is the only issue that is still in the case as it appears here.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.888" offset="2314951">Again, this issue is not a resolution by this Court is whether the contractor was in fact justified, the assumption that there might some justifications, in defaulting rather than awaiting a resolution of his dispute about whether or not, he was entitled to an increased price in light of the new determinations of wages by the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.658" offset="2438040">Because the Court of Claims impliedly ruled at least that this question was an open one and because it ruled clearly that the question should be determined in light of the underlying facts that a factual record should be made before the question would be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.812" offset="2538663">It held that a trial was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.461" offset="2553187">Now the resolution of that issue will determine whether the contractor was excused from the normal penalty of default which is forfeiture of this deposit and conceivably whether the Government's action was so unwarranted to entitle him to additional damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.100" offset="2655796">Now the issue in this Court, as I've said, does not relate to the denial of the motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.689" offset="2690173">We did not petition on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.741" offset="2702294">We accept the ruling of the Court of Claims that there are factual issues that must be determined somewhere, that a factual record must be made before the ultimate legal issue is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.724" offset="2758301">Our only quarrel is with respect to where that factual finding should be made, where the record should be made in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.567" offset="2809605">We say that it must be made before the administrative board and not in the Court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.015" offset="2839385">Now it seems to us that the Bianchi case squarely controls this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.817" offset="2866657">The thrust of that decision is clearly that factual disputes arising out of a contract of this kind should, in the first instance, be resolved administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.607" offset="2917752">The only question here is whether the rule is any different because the Board had once erroneously refused to entertain the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.308" offset="2968639">Now again Bianchi, it seems to us, answers that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.599" offset="2993716">The Court said in that case that if the administrative record is inadequate or if the Board has committed some error, still the Court should stay its hand, correct the error, and while it had no power to remand, it should stay the proceedings in the Court awaiting a correction of that error by the Board or a completion of the record in further board proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.041" offset="3119522">That rule it seems to us is fully appropriate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.961" offset="3143241">It's important to stress I think that the Board here has not refused to decide the underlying dispute because it thought it lacked jurisdiction to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.608" offset="3185768">It's simply erroneously thought the appeal was untimely and for that reason and that reason alone, it did not resolved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.243" offset="3228296">Accordingly, there's no reason to believe that it will not resolve the dispute if given an opportunity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.138" offset="3259956">Indeed, the Board's opinion gives a rather clear indication in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.293" offset="3292557">It says with apparent approval and I'm reading from page 36 of the record, at the bottom of the page, "The parties are in complete agreement that it was and is their mutual interpretation that in the event of a timely appeal -- in the event a timely appeal is taken thereunder, the disputes paragraph' of the Letter of Acceptability confers jurisdiction on the Board to review a decision relating to cancellation of commitments, withholding of bid security, and itemization and determination of actual damages."</text>
            <text syncTime="834.081" offset="3439679">In light of that, there is certainly no reason to suppose, the Board will fail to determine the controversy if given the chance to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.656" offset="3622013">Mr. Claiborne, I suppose one theoretical question or theory is whether this is a matter of the Bianchi is based on the idea that one must exhaust the administrative remedy by having a trial of having the evidence to use there and then the appellate courts or the reviewing courts will review of it will confine themselves to that record or whether there's some other theory underlying Bianchi.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.858" offset="4222830">The first was the self-evident proposition that having in one sense exhausted its administrative remedy because it found the door to the Board closed by the ruling that the appeal was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.909" offset="4295032">Of course, the contractor was entitled at that point to come into court, but it doesn't fall off from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.073" offset="4327633">The Court having once corrected the error held that the appeal was timely should then proceed ahead to decide the merits of a controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.361" offset="4368802">That is not the normal rule in reviewing courts when they are faced with the administrative decisions which either are incomplete in that the findings are insufficient or which because of an erroneous ruling as a matter of law never reached the issues which the Court finds relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.450" offset="4665135">The argument was there made that because the Court of Claims was not in the technical sense a reviewing court and furthermore because it, and the District Courts some cases involving claims of under $10,000 and trial courts did not suffer the same disadvantage as Courts of Appeal who more commonly have the function of reviewing administrative orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.573" offset="4777671">But for these reasons, the Court of Claims should not be treated as a mere reviewing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.763" offset="4822392">The opinion of the Court in Bianchi recognizes and rejects both of those suggestions pointing out that there are cases where trial courts do have this reviewing function and pointing out that the legislative history of the Wunderlich Act was intended to put the Court of Claims with respect to these type of cases in precisely the same position as the Court of Appeal on review of a normal -- of another kind of administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.626" offset="4965857">So that, I think that the Bianchi decision adverted and resolved that question whether the Court of Claims may be viewed as any other reviewing courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.454" offset="5069197">Finally, the Court of Claims in the decision below suggests a further reason why in these circumstances it would be inappropriate to remand the case to the Board and that is because of the delays inherent in a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.531" offset="5149445">It reads this Court's opinion in Bianchi as stating that speed of adjudication is the central consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.513" offset="5205452">Now there are really two answers to that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.151" offset="5216005">The first is that there is a remand in any event when the Court remands the case to its trial commissioner although it is in one sense within the same Court, there are delays attendant in that procedure and as our brief attempts to show, those delays maybe greater or at least as great as the delays that might be involved if the case was sent back to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.164" offset="5336064">But in any event, this Court's decision in Bianchi did not say that speed was a virtue at all costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.962" offset="5383189">They were and or other reasons underlying the Bianchi rule which lets the administrative boards decide factual issues arising under government contracts to be decided administratively in the first instance rather than judicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.895" offset="5454973">It would be -- it would seem unnecessary to rehearse all those considerations here, but it's worth mentioning three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.508" offset="5489455">One is that the parties themselves have agreed to have these matters resolved within the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.506" offset="5521429">And the proper respect for that agreement, for that stipulation of the parties otherwise that in all permissible circumstances, the decision be at the administrative level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.257" offset="5572420">The second is that these boards do have a special familiarity, a special competence, one might even say an expertise in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.822" offset="5618709">And for that reason, it's appropriate that whenever possible, they be permitted in the first instance to decide especially the factual questions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.800" offset="5662595">And finally, the boards of these agencies, in one sense the agencies themselves, should be afforded an opportunity to correct the errors of their subordinates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.719" offset="5726229">That is certainly a healthy policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.326" offset="5748694">It confines in some cases the matters to the administrative level and spares needless work for the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.435" offset="7069132">And thirdly, independent of these two, we are properly before the Court of Claims because the interpretation of the documents before the Court constituted matters of the law and I -- and its well settled now that once having established this jurisdiction and it's right to hear the case on matters affecting law, it may in a correlative coordinate way, determine all related factual issues in connection therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.768" offset="7194415">The government in the Maine correctly summarized the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.377" offset="7236838">I would not spend the time to review them in depth other than to remind this Court most respectfully that at some eight years ago that Grace first came in to touch with its invitation forbid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.358" offset="7308831">It has reposed uncomfortably for five years in the Court of Claims that the Government waited two and a half years before making its motion for summary judgment in the Court of Claims, and in that motion, never offered the relief which it -- which it offers today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.209" offset="7380198">In connection with the dispute clause which is a part of the papers, and if I may revert for a moment, the typical Kay part situation is set forth in Anthony Miller and that reference is in page 4 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.789" offset="7450520">So I will not burden the Court with the detail procedure for a Kay part other than to say that the procedure is complicated and comprehensive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.397" offset="7864926">After protracted hearing there which was not on the merits, the trial examiner concluded “beyond per adventure of doubt” that Grace is not here timely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.210" offset="7952175">Now in Bianchi, we had what might approach at that time a standard dispute clause, but our clause is so radically different from that clause that there is another compelling reason why we should not be considered within the framework of Bianchi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.117" offset="8015809">However, when we went before the Board of Contract Appeals and the Board Commissioner determined we were not timely, we were barred from any further administrative remedy, and our only recourse was to assume and take on the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims which we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.862" offset="8110791">I will have occasion in a moment to advert to the fact as to whether at the refusal to consider the case was in fact denying to the Board that it had jurisdiction because the Court of Claims as a fact, found that such denial of an opportunity to be heard constitutes a denial of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.337" offset="8208697">So in effect, the Board told us at the lower level, we are sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.608" offset="8821844">The -- in December of 1959, Grace filed its appeal with the Board of Contract Claims, and in June of 1960, there was a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.326" offset="8904704">The important thing to remember in connection with the disputes clause and -- is that it promised, it promised an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.051" offset="8971577">And in that sense, they did not live up to their promise even independent of timeliness and in that respect, the clause radically differs in Bianchi Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.768" offset="9014418">Now we, as I've said, take the position that there are three valid reasons why this Court should permit the Court of Claims to retain jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.767" offset="9058408">The first that we are outside of Bianchi and the second that we have exhaust this rate of remedy, and the third that there was an interpretation of the contract and therefore a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.923" offset="9107101">After the first point, I have alluded to the fact that we are not here dealing with the standard provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.825" offset="9134686">In Bianchi, the Court in most excellent fashion reviewed the history of the Court of Claims activity in this field, including a summary of the Wunderlich statute and then made its most important decision affecting government procurement as reflected in Bianchi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.593" offset="9225697">Just briefly to again recapitulate the difference between the two clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.321" offset="9240639">In the standard clause, you have a limitation on facts whereas in the Grace clause, there were no limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.604" offset="9277837">In the standard clause, there is a requirement that the contractor proceed with the work whereas in the Grace, there was no such requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.997" offset="9323395">We would deny that opportunity as the record will show and in the standards clause, there is no promise of an opportunity to present evidence at a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.509" offset="9369370">Whereas in our case, there was that promise in the last sentence of the clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2345.169" offset="9484100">And the sentence I have eluded too, sir, is “In connection with any appeal under this paragraph, you will be afforded an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence in support of your appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.792" offset="9542510">This was denied to Grace at the administrative level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.810" offset="9582634">So there are serious distinguishing characteristics which in our judgment lead us to the conclusion that this may very well be unrelated to Bianchi and not within its strict interpretation or rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.753" offset="9646373">There are other reasons why there are differences here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.376" offset="9660897">In Bianchi, there was a hearing on the merits, in our case, no hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.866" offset="9694856">In Bianchi, you had a valid decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.279" offset="9708440">In our case, what proof to be an invalid decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.204" offset="9732159">Our controversy is beyond the disputes clause whereas Bianchi was clearly within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.276" offset="9780433">The Government has carefully omitted to mention that our clause is not standard and they have indifferently assumed that the Board will accept a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.547" offset="9829543">I know of no law or regulation or any power compelling the Board of Contract Appeals to accept this case in the first instance and secondly, if it were to, that it could not, for a second time, claim that we were untimely or for any other reason, disqualify this contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.114" offset="9943855">At page 13 of the Government's brief, the Government cites four cases suggesting in those cases that remand was feasible and accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.727" offset="10094320">But as respectfully suggested that an examination of those four cases will reveal that they are completely irrelevant, they did not involve any disputes clause, Wunderlich or Bianchi but were on a general proposition totally unrelated to the subject matter at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.280" offset="10176449">So before proceeding with the second point, may I again remind the Court that through no point of Grace, he was denied what was rightfully his under contract and it was the Government who broke their agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.110" offset="10251786">I believe a part of the disputes provision is the requirement that the Government give a correct decision or else suffer the consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.489" offset="10289298">To permit the Government to have made the error and then require us to return before the same person who committed the error, I respectfully submit is most unfair and even deeper works a great injustice to the defense industry contractor who all of us know have too many square corners now to turn and who should, if anything be given the opportunity for speedy resolution of their problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.544" offset="10481560">On this first point, when we claim we are beyond Bianchi, we are saying also sir that we are beyond Wunderlich.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.028" offset="10527535">Our second point is that we have exhausted our administrative remedy and we just had no place else to go, but to the Court of Claims and this through no fault of our own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.192" offset="10580093">Now the Government at page 14 in its brief states the general proposition that neither the Court of Claims nor any District Court can consider these disputes unless the contractor has first exhausted its administrative remedies and we have no quarrel because that actually is the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.918" offset="10695032">It is our contention that the failure of the Government to render a correct decision and to give this case and to hear the case on the merits, constituted such exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.902" offset="10755009">The Government has not suggested in its brief nor does it cite any authority as to what may happen if Grace is denied an opportunity before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.850" offset="10802761">As I mentioned earlier, I know of no rule requiring this Board to take the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.788" offset="10846542">As a practical matter and as a matter of realism, look what chaos can happen and occur when a contracting officer makes a mistake, and it's compounded by a local administrative board and the contractor thereafter sticks its remedy in the Court and it is later found that this were an error, should that contractor be penalized and the case remanded?</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.875" offset="10950823">This may happen a number of times, not just once or isn't the federal rule that the Government should just have one bite at the apple and that we shouldn't attempt to unring the bell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.515" offset="11017383">Once they've made their decision, should the innocent contractor suffer therefore?</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.212" offset="11040266">It would appear to me that it'd be quite important, and again, I speak on behalf of an industry that deserves the consideration of this highest court, that they not be penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.396" offset="11128978">The Court of Claims found, the full Court of Claims found there was no dissent on this point that under the present state of the law, a contractor may seek and find relief from the error of either a contracting officer or the administrative agency by appeal to that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.739" offset="11206301">In Langenfelder, in Zachry, in both cases, in both cases, the Court of Claims held that the contractor was relieved and he need not pursue any further futile remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.619" offset="11325837">We agree that in the general rule, the contractor must first exhaust his administrative remedies before proceeding with the Court, but as had been established by this Court in both Blair and Holpuch, exceptions to that rule are pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.783" offset="11394487">We believe we come within that exception, namely, that we've exhausted our administrative remedy and that we are properly within the realm of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.312" offset="11448613">It would seem just right to require a contractor to revert only once as I mentioned earlier to hold otherwise, would just be chaotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.949" offset="11531160">The Government in its brief at page 16, states, speaking of the Board below, the Board merely dismissed an untimely -- as untimely -- I beg your pardon, the Board merely dismissed as untimely an administrative appeal which the Court of Claims believed timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.649" offset="11625932">The Board's action was at most a prejudicial error not a denial of jurisdiction over the subject matter and it is respectfully submitted that that is directly contrary to the holding of the Court of Claims for the full court determined that this was a recognition by the Board that it had no jurisdiction to take the case for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.988" offset="11743274">As a matter of fact, under the decisions affecting the operations of the Board of Contract Appeals, once the appeal period has expired, I believe there is no authority in anyone to extend that 30-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.672" offset="11826030">I do not know whether the Board will be willing to do that which under its prior decisions hasn't found to be impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.931" offset="11867094">The third point and concluding point concerns the fact that the administrative record before the Court of Claims involves a question of law thereby permitting said court to retain general jurisdiction and to resolve de novo, all or related factual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.513" offset="11961448">As the record reveals, Grace was perfectly willing to continue with its performance and to construct the required buildings, but was denied that opportunity because in the fact, two contrary at wage administrations were issued and each of them changed the scope of the work as set forth in the prior invitation for bid and the interpretation of these matters properly was determined by the Court of Claims to be interpretations involving or conclusion -- involving conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.598" offset="12125811">Having so determined it, they may properly retain and resolve all factual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.814" offset="12150680">It would appear only just proper and fair that Grace not require a fragmentation of its remedy because it is well established that certain of the issues might very well require resolution in the Court of Claims and on this point, I believe the full court below was unanimous and the government concedes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.848" offset="12258722">Since the Board of Contract Appeals, the Board of Contract Appeals will not resolve matters touching upon wage determinations and similar matters.</text>
