            <label>Mr. Robert N. Kharasch</label>
            <text syncTime="47.039" offset="291506">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.503" offset="305403">We have here a case which is, in one way similar to the Atlantic Coastline case just argued and in several ways rather more far reaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.823" offset="354617">This case involves a duty of a common carrier to carry for all shippers, a duty which has been recognized for centuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.700" offset="386173">At common law, when a carrier refused to carry, the remedy was swift and it was simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.966" offset="411251">The shipper sued the carrier and collected damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.550" offset="429537">Under the Shipping Act, there is now a statutory remedy of reparation for shippers injured by water carrier's violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.050" offset="467571">The questions presented in this Consolo case involved a future vitality of the reparation remedy in three very basic ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.598" offset="505814">First, there is a question of jurisdiction to review a reparation order of an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.817" offset="530683">This question involves not only the question presented in the Atlantic Coastline case just argued, but also the question whether the review procedure for Maritime Commission orders is going to be so violently complex as to defeat the statutory reparation remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.022" offset="607483">Second, there is presented a question of the standards to be followed by an agency in awarding reparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.201" offset="640188">Is there, as the statute says there is reparation, for unjust and unreasonable discrimination or is there hidden in the statute some license to discriminate against shippers with impunity because of some never before known and unarticulated doctrine of equities which defeat the remedy for flagrant discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="158.528" offset="737468">Essentially, the question is whether this Maritime statute has in it some vague equitable concept like the concept of misconduct in Pennsylvania discussed earlier today.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.898" offset="790967">Third, and equally important for the future of the law of reparation, the Consolo case presents an important question of the standards of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.013" offset="835375">If there is a standard of equity in awarding reparation, who judges the equities, is it to be the agency passing on the facts or reviewing Court making fact findings for itself?</text>
            <text syncTime="199.952" offset="903189">The facts of this case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.238" offset="916355">Philip R. Consolo is an independent importer of bananas.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.968" offset="931192">As an independent importer, he needed supplies of bananas from Ecuador which is the country supplying bananas to the independents who don't own the plantation.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.833" offset="974660">Second, he required regular service to carry bananas to the United States by a common carrier which had refrigerated space available in its ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.546" offset="1017605">It was carrying bananas as well as hundreds of other commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.783" offset="1038503">At relevant times, there were two common carriers in the trade from Ecuador to the United States, the Grace Line and Flota Mercante Grancolombiana, which is the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.170" offset="1092002">The common law duty of an ocean carrier to carry for all shippers was continued under the Shipping Act, and the agency administering the Shipping Act had twice held, once in 1953 again in 1957, that the Grace Line had to carry for all shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.927" offset="1167130">In 1955, Flota had given all its refrigerated space to a single preferred shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.563" offset="1193671">In 1957, which is the time it becomes relevant here, this carrier knew that this shipper wanted space but Flota had secretly determined to give all of its refrigerated space to the preferred shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.662" offset="1262007">Consolo, in order to get space on Flota, in order to attempt to receive the reparation provided by statute, had to go through the two-step procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.847" offset="1318745">He first had to go to the agency and prove that the carrier had unjustly discriminated against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.798" offset="1350614">That caused the agency to make a finding of unjust, unfair discrimination which was effective for the future and it issued a cease and desist order to this carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.555" offset="1397635">That cease and desist order has been reviewed and upheld, finding of unjust discrimination is unquestioned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.839" offset="1430758">Next, Consolo had to go back to the agency and begin the process of proving his entitlement to reparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.612" offset="1461791">He had to show the damages for each sailing from which he was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.715" offset="1498258">The Board's examiner decided, after reviewing this extensive detailed evidence that Consolo was entitled to reparation in the amount of about $260,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.213" offset="1540263">At this point, the carrier began to offer a lot of excuses for its conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.487" offset="1569311">The Maritime Board, which reviewed the examiner's decision, entered an award of $143,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.557" offset="1601599">At this point, both Flota and Consolo went to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.264" offset="1640469">Consolo claiming that the Commission had cut down the award wrongly, the carrier claimed that the award was too large.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.258" offset="1676413">Consolo followed a decision in what is in the Piazza case which is discussed at some length in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.499" offset="1713403">The Court of Appeals held on its first review that it had jurisdiction to review the reparation award and to consider the carrier's attacks on the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.797" offset="1762513">However, while the Court had held and affirmed the Commission that there was an unjust illegal discrimination against Consolo, the Court also held, this time without any citation of authority, that the Board had made an error because the Maritime Board had defined not only that the shutting out of Consolo was unjust and unreasonable, but also that the Maritime Board had to make a specific finding that it would be equitable to award reparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.289" offset="1888528">I'd like just to pause here and point out that, in the course of this litigation, Consolo was still far away from the place where he had to go to collect any money because he's -- where at this point, he's talking about what is only a piece of prima facie evidence in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.572" offset="1957700">The injured shipper has got to get a piece of evidence and get to the District Court with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.044" offset="1979538">And, all that's going around in the Court of Appeals was just about something that becomes a piece of prima facie evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.569" offset="2017677">In any event, the Court of Appeals held that it had jurisdiction to review the award at the carrier's instance and the Court of Appeals sent the case back to the Maritime Board for a finding as to whether it would be equitable to pay the shipper for the damages he suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.803" offset="2094582">The Maritime Board had, by that time, turned into the Maritime Commission and the Maritime Commission, on remand, found that all the equities were in favor of the shipper but they didn't face -- they did not fail to reduce the award again by another slice off the top for the third time.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.835" offset="2330728">It couldn't enforce the order but it held that it did have jurisdiction to consider the shipper's attack on the order as being too small, as well as the carrier's attack that it was too large.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.244" offset="3204368">And then, on the second review by the Court of Appeals, which had asked the Commission to say whether or not the equities were in the shipper's favor, the Court of Appeals again decided, and again without citation of any authority, that it thought it would be inequitable to award reparation, and they reverse the reward, and the shipper, at the moment it comes here with absolutely nothing, no piece of evidence to the District Court, where in the District Court, undoubtedly, we're going to litigate some more.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.981" offset="3343339">Turning for just one moment to the jurisdictional issue, I think it would be helpful to make it clear after the Atlantic Coastline argument what the general view of all Courts -- Federal Courts has been as to the nature of a reparation order and the crispest statement was in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in the second time around on United States versus ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.228" offset="3456293">The Court said there in a footnote, it said describing a reparation order, it says “By statute, such an order is not a binding administrative determination but is simply to be considered prima facie evidence of the findings embodied in it in an independent action at law against the carrier”, citing Section 16 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.229" offset="3560260">“Thus, it happens that no such order has ever been subject to direct judicial review.”</text>
            <text syncTime="872.287" offset="3592547">That is the Court of Appeals speaking as to what has been, for 50 years, the unquestioned view of the nature of a reparation order.</text>
