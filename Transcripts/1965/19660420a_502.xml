            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="35.990" offset="249354">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.006" offset="261475">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals the Tenth Circuit and it involves appeals from judgments of conviction for the crime of conspiracy to defraud the United States under the appropriate clause of the General Federal Conspiracy Statute, 18 U.S. Code 371.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.445" offset="355203">Now the nature of the unlawful conduct which this case involves arises out of Section 9 (h) of the old Taft-Hartley law enacted in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.327" offset="414762">That Act was to be sure, repelled in 1959 and its successor, Section 504 of the Labor Management Act is the statute that Your Honors reviewed in the Archie Brown case last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.284" offset="462514">But the indictment here antedates that repealer and that is why it is arising under the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.477" offset="495323">The old law, Section 9 (h) was before this Court in appropriate proceedings to test constitutionality in the Douds case and thereafter, there were various cases involving prosecutions for filing false affidavits, the Jencks case, the Travis case and various others that who've been here.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.736" offset="580378">So I take it that the Court is generally familiar with the structure of that law which required that officers of labor unions file affidavits denying that they were members of or affiliated with the Communist Party as a precondition for a compliance status on the part of the union of which they were officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.468" offset="671284">That Section 9 (h) incorporated as a sanction for filing false affidavits, the general federal statute known as the False Statements Act, 18 U.S. Code 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.448" offset="735232">So that the penalty for the false affidavits is that general criminal provision rather than any peculiar provision of the Taft-Hartley law itself.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="168.419" offset="779118">And most of -- most if not all of the previous and other prosecutions other than this case had been brought under that statute, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="telford_taylor" startTime="176.382" stopTime="475.184">
            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="176.382" offset="810987">They have indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.977" offset="813286">This is the -- there have been two conspiracy prosecutions Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.126" offset="833975">One in the West case in which certiorari was denied here and this is the other one.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.452" offset="855186">This is the only other case in which a conspiracy to violate the false affidavit provisions has been charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.292" offset="886638">Now the petitioners here are or they were at the time of the acts charged, officers and employees of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers which referred to in the briefs for aviation purposes as Mine, Mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.119" offset="957900">And the gist of the charge against them is that they conspired -- is that they were at the time, members of the Communist Party, and that they conspired with each other that those among them who were officers would file false affidavits, false in that they denied Communist membership when in fact they were members and thereby obtained compliance status.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.590" offset="1059777">I should add that of the six petitioners here at the time of these circumstances, four only were officers and actually filed affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.836" offset="1104812">The other two were employees not required to file affidavits but charged as co-conspirators along with the four who did the actual filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.971" offset="1149325">These convictions were affirmed by the -- the trial was in the District of Colorado, the convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeals the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.973" offset="1189345">We filed a petition for certiorari on a number of grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.115" offset="1213900">The grant of certiorari was limited to three questions; the first being the statutory sufficiency of the indictment, that is to say whether the allegations in the indictment sufficiently make out a charge of conspiracy-to-defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.893" offset="1284953">Secondly, the constitutionality of Section 9 (h), which indeed had been sustained in Douds but which as we suggested in our petition, the authority of that case had been at least undermined by Archie Brown and therefore, the question of constitutionality was ripe for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.604" offset="1359872">And thirdly, a question not pertaining to indictment but to the trial itself and that is the denial of motions that we made at the trial to have produced the grand jury testimony of government witnesses who testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.212" offset="1442314">That motion is made in the alternative either for the production direct to us, the defense counsel, or failing that for production to the Court for in camera inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.631" offset="1487976">Those motions were denied and that raises the third question, standing generally from the Pittsburgh Plate Glass decision of -- several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.123" offset="1525906">Now the limited grant of certiorari here I think obligates any necessity for any extended statement on the facts in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.265" offset="1562478">But the Court will see that these cases of a certain age and it may assist a little bit if I indicate what the procedural steps had been and why it now appears here so long after.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.779" offset="1616499">The -- under statute repealed seven years ago, the indictment is a 1956, ten years ago and as the indictment shows, the overt acts and the initial affidavits filed here that were alleged to be false were filed as long ago as 1949, the time would be alleged conception of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.084" offset="1693717">When the indictment was brought that the defendants of whom there were 14 charged in the indictment, filed a motion to dismiss on various grounds, including the constitutional ground which we did not argue below because the lower courts were then have been bound by Douds, but in which we seriously pressed the motion to dismiss on the ground of statutory insufficiency that there was no sufficient showing in the indictment of the necessary element of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.088" offset="1813776">That motion was argued before Judge Breitenstein, he was then the District Judge and he held it a long time and then was appointed to the Circuit Court of Appeals and without deciding the motion, he referred it to the late Judge Niles who is the Senior District Judge in the District of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.575" offset="1891725">Judge Niles heard it argued a second time, held that a considerable period of time then denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.125" offset="1917952">So the defendants didn't actually go to trial until 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.653" offset="1936029">Then three of them plead nolo contendere, 11 went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.458" offset="1955255">The judge dismissed the charge against two, nine were convicted and we appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and the judgment was reversed on the ground of errors in the admission of evidence.</text>

            <label>Justice Tom C. Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="475.184" offset="2006141">What were the grounds?</text>

          <turn speaker="telford_taylor" startTime="476.319" stopTime="627.921">
            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="476.319" offset="2010739">Errors in the admission of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.009" offset="2021501">Inadmissible evidence pertaining to conspiracy and the Court of Appeals also directed the equivalent, two more defendants, so there is seven left and the seven left were tried the second time in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.356" offset="2070821">The jury acquitted one more and the six remaining are the petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.609" offset="2099869">I should add that following the decision in the Archie Brown case, we filed a petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals, alleging the new grounds but that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.588" offset="2143754">Now the evidence is summarized on page 5 of our brief, but I think I need not advert to it farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.289" offset="2166533">The general gist was a period of noncompliance followed by a decision that compliance was necessary, filing of these affidavits for the purpose of securing compliance and that really is the whole story.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.075" offset="2233720">The rulings of the trial I have already averted to in connection with the grand jury in minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.451" offset="2251274">I would like to discuss with I hope appropriate affirmity each of the three points we have raised in the petition and I will deal first of course with the points relating to the indictment and in accordance with the general principles about postponing constitutional questions if other grounds are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.602" offset="2331836">I will first discuss the statutory point.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.781" offset="2348554">Now the two clauses, the 18 U.S. Code 371, the conspiracy statute has been here many times of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.111" offset="2381887">It punishes the conspiring either to commit any offense against the United States or to defraud the United States or any agency in any manner and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.960" offset="2425250">And there have been, over the years, repeated decisions indicating that those two clauses of the statute are not mutually exclusive, but they are distinct that they are in part overlapping that they are not congruent that an indictment to be valid under that statute must contain a proper charge of either one element or the other or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.852" offset="2536845">To be brought under the offense clause, a statutory offense must be charged to the -- the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.848" offset="2556803">To be brought under the fraud clause, fraud must be charged as an element of the offense or to be brought into both you must have both elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.674" offset="2596091">Now in this case, we have an indictment brought in the language --</text>

            <text syncTime="627.921" offset="2617093">Of the actual fraud as an element of the offense is it -- it has to be a conspiracy to defraud, but it doesn't need to be successful to defraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="637.267" offset="2654501">That's quite right Mr. Justice Stewart and it does not need to be successful, but the charge must embody a charge of intent to defraud the government if it is to survive under the foreign clause and that charge must be substantiated by the underlying allegations --</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="652.569" offset="2715732">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.890" offset="2720956">The case that we most particularly rely on in this connection is the Bridges case in 346 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.850" offset="2752825">Now the Bridges case in this application here, stands for two propositions which we think are governing.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.189" offset="2786158">In the first place, that the clause invoked by the government, the invocation is not determinative, the government cannot make out a case under the fraud clause simply by saying it would like to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.354" offset="2834850">Simply by saying conspiracy-to-defraud, that's not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.535" offset="2847598">You must look through to the substance of the charge to see whether fraud is indeed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.762" offset="2868496">And the second thing that Bridges case held was that if the unlawful element in the conspiracy is indeed a statutory offense, then it will not lie under the fraud clause unless fraud is an essential element of that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.003" offset="2949475">In the Bridges case itself, the charge was conspiracy-to-defraud the government by making a false statement and a naturalization proceeding and the Court held that default statement in the naturalization proceeding is itself statutory offense and that it is an offense whether fraudulent or not that any false statement, fraudulent or not, is punishable under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.771" offset="3044456">And therefore, since the offense constituting the unlawful element of the conspiracy did not necessarily involved fraud, the conspiracy-to-defraud had not been made out.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.764" offset="3188443">It did involve the War-time Suspension of Liabilities Act, but that was exactly the same question.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.098" offset="3205789">If a conspiracy-to-defraud were properly charged, then the War-time Suspension would have applied and the statute of limitations would not have run, but since a conspiracy-to-defraud was attempted to be charged but unsuccessfully charged, the War-time Suspension Act did not apply and the prosecution was barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.680" offset="3284156">That is I think with all respect is the precise holding of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.318" offset="3302651">Now, applying that here, and may it please the Court, the statute involved here is 18 U.S. Code 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.283" offset="3342566">The only unlawful thing that the defendants are charged with doing here is agreeing to file and indeed filing false affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.337" offset="3382794">If no affidavits have been filed, there would be no conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.711" offset="3396274">If the affidavits had been true, there was no conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.959" offset="3409230">The only unlawful element in the whole picture here is the charge that these affidavits were false.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.785" offset="3436607">Now, this Court has twice said and the lower federal courts have repeatedly held that under 18 U.S. Code 1001 fraud is not an essential element.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.407" offset="3483000">This came up for a recent consideration in the Grainger case which was just argued together with Bridges and decided at the same time and the Court in the Grainger case, speaking through Mr. Justice Burton, drew the distinction between the so-called false claims statute, where the case held fraud is an essential element, and the False Statements Act involved here which the Grainger opinion said does not involve fraud as an essential element.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.524" offset="3623539">Therefore, and as I say, there are many lower court cases holding the same thing that fraud is not an element under the False Statements Act, we say here that the government has indeed endeavored to charge a conspiracy-to-defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.475" offset="3679336">They have tried to invoke that clause, but all they have actually done is charge a conspiracy to violate 1001 and fraud is not an element of that statute anymore than it was of the statute in Bridges case.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.466" offset="3739314">Now, may I point out one other quite relevant factor here, this case is I think a clearer one for the dismissal of this indictment than was Bridges.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.326" offset="3790723">In the Bridges case, one could and indeed the Government did argue that the United States have relied on the truth of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.260" offset="3838474">The statement alleged to be false there was that Bridges in the course of naturalization proceeding was asked whether he had been a member of the Communist Party and said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.815" offset="3876718">And the Government's position was that in reliance on that denial, the Government naturalized him.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.140" offset="3914021">That cannot be argued here because in point of fact, the National Labor Relations Board did not rely on the truth of this affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.764" offset="3948502">The initial procedure before the Board was indeed that they would pass on the truth or falsity of these affidavits, but Your Honors in the Leedom case and Meat Cutters case, held that this was not a matter for the Board's determination that all that the Board was interested in was getting an affidavit and compliance status followed whether or not the affidavit was false or true.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.213" offset="4054246">Indeed, the prosecution for filing a false affidavit could follow, but noncompliance did not follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.867" offset="4084861">Therefore, nothing so far as the Board was concerned hang-on the truth or falsity of these affidavits and there was therefore no reliance in the sense of a fraud prosecution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="1013.645" offset="4159990">No, there is not directly Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.150" offset="4173991">It is possible that if this were construed as an indictment for conspiracy to commit an offense, that some of the initial affidavits would now be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.127" offset="4225923">There are complications there because of a change in the statutory period in the course of the -- from three years to five years in the course of that and I really don't think it is pertinent to the body of my arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.176" offset="4270122">I would prefer not to get into it, that is not a crucial part of our contention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.585" offset="4291751">We do however say that there was prejudice but we are not making a purely technical argument here and the -- of course, I never know whether the word technical means in argument if it is stronger or weaker, but we do feel that this is not purely a form of proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.009" offset="4353505">The Government suggests in their brief that there is no real prejudice here, but we suggest there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.458" offset="4379209">If all that has been done here is to charge the defendants with conspiracy to commit an offense, and the Government addresses that up with fraud language, well fraud indictments are read -- the indictment is read to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.381" offset="4430932">Of course, juries are always instructed that the indictment is only a charge and not a proof but any trial a lawyer knows that what the jury hears from an indictment, does make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.843" offset="4476803">The view that people take charges of fraud is very different in the view they take of some kinds of offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.246" offset="4502403">We have cited in our brief situations where judges in sentencing have indicated that they've view a charge of conspiracy-to-defraud as the very much more serious one than conspiracy to commit an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.063" offset="4557678">So that in all of those ways, prejudice was certainly possible whether they are not, then as Mr. Justice Harlan suggested, there may also be a statute of limitations problem too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.583" offset="4607728">I would suggest in conclusion on this point that there is also a general policy problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.546" offset="4627581">The clause of that statute having to do with fraud, that is the conspiracy-to-defraud, has been a good deal criticized in recent years as being too loose and imprecise and being a relic of days when conspiracy concepts were not as tight as the Court has drawn in more recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.649" offset="4715980">And that there is already a need for other than as a vague catchall, but the Government should be required to specify a statutory offense as the object of an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.875" offset="4760910">And however that may be, there's no suggestion that it is beyond the power of Congress to do this, but we don't think the Court should extend the application of the fraud clause to cases clearly covered by the offense clause under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.912" offset="4841054">Now, I would like to pass to the sector of the points, the constitutionality of Section 9 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.858" offset="4876894">Our basic argument here is that this case is governed by the Archie Brown decision that there is no meaningful distinction between this case and the Archie Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.385" offset="4930915">The Archie Brown case was decided in this Court on the basis of the bill of attainder and we suggest that what the Court decided there is plainly applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.057" offset="4969681">I will deal in a moment with distinctions which might suggest it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.517" offset="4991519">We also say that the statute is unconstitutional under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.002" offset="5017433">The Archie Brown case itself was decided in the Court of Appeals, not on the basis of bill of attainder but on the basis of the First Amendment and we think that that is an adequate alternative attack on the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.028" offset="5073544">I should add that we think that second branch of attack under the First Amendment is considerably strengthened by the decision on the -- in the Elfbrant case to which I'll advert in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.150" offset="5125998">The Court has so recently and so completely reviewed the bill of attainder concept that it doesn't seem to me it would serve any useful purpose for me to pursue at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.647" offset="5171973">The basis of the concept as a particular application in Archie Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.795" offset="5188587">I'm aware of course that the Court was sharply divided in the Archie Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.987" offset="5205410">I am aware too that the -- and the constitutional dimension of stare decisis is not as often respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.579" offset="5235712">Nonetheless, the case is recent, fully considered and I would therefore like to devote my time to possible distinctions rather than any basic reexamination of the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.519" offset="5279493">The Government has suggested that the Archie Brown decision is not applicable because in that case, the Court was concerned with a criminal sanction, Section 504, which imposed a criminal sanction against simultaneous Communist membership and union officership, whereas here the sanction is non-criminal -- is the pressure for -- on unions who wished to have a compliant status and as that Government puts it the discouragement which it affords to Communist being the way the union officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.957" offset="5441243">We cannot see that that distinction between the criminal and the non-criminal sanction is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.797" offset="5476561">Cummings against -- Cummings case, Ex parte Garland, the Lovett case, none of those were criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.058" offset="5505609">There is no suggestion in the majority opinion in the Brown case, that is the distinction between a criminal and another sanction should be governing, nor as I recall it that is suggested in the minority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.040" offset="5561616">The majority opinion in the Brown case did suggest the different distinction and that is that in 9 (h), one could lift one self out of the sanction category by resignation from the Communist Party whereas in Archie Brown, there was a five-year provision so that an immediate resignation would not have resulted in lifting the ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.547" offset="5663598">The Court did point that out in the Douds case -- in the Brown case, but once again, the majority opinion itself suggests that that may not be a sufficient distinction that the bill of attainder concept may operate whether the purpose is retributive for the past or ameliorative for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.365" offset="5758892">The Government as far as I can see has not advanced that as a suggestion in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.063" offset="5781671">These are I believe the only two possible basis for distinguishing this from the Brown case and I would suggest that they are -- either of them sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.881" offset="5876966">Yes, I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.430" offset="5891176">Now so far as First Amendment is concerned, may I point out what I believe is the most important factual circumstance here and that is that the indictment is barren of any charge with respect to the nature of the defendant's Communist membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.108" offset="5981874">There is no suggestion that they knew anything about the aims of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.977" offset="6005279">There is no suggestion about activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.600" offset="6015833">There is no suggestion about intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.179" offset="6034119">Therefore, the Section 9 (h) has been applied throughout and I think must be regarded today as a statute where the sanction applies to bear membership, nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.933" offset="6093155">In the Scales case, you have the element of knowledge of the unlawful purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.026" offset="6117501">The Elfbrandt case decided on Monday, the dissenting opinion does indeed make much of the fact that's in the statute there it was limited to members who knew the unlawful purposes of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.086" offset="6193779">There's no such requirement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.302" offset="6202661">The sanction applies whether or not there's any such knowledge or any degree of activity or intent and the Court of Appeals the Ninth Circuit on those rounds held Section 9 (h) unconstitutional under the First Amendment as it did not fulfill the requirements stated by this Court in the Scales case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.123" offset="6289910">The Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit decided that case three days before this Court decided the Aptheker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.708" offset="6328257">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit of course felt bound by Douds and therefore felt bound to distinguish it and distinguished Douds on the ground that that was a criminal -- that that was a non-criminal sanction whereas 504 is criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.054" offset="6385622">But the Aptheker case which came down three days later, removed I suggest the basis for that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.071" offset="6409655">There was no criminal penalty there either, nor is there in the Elfbrandt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.700" offset="6436195">So again, although one can point to the difference between the criminal and the non-criminal treatment, one can point to the five-year provision as differences, it does not seem to us that those differences are meaningful for either of the constitutional arguments we are advancing here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.423" offset="6547163">Now, the Government does however advance a further argument with respect to our right to raise a constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.124" offset="6589900">Their argument is that since the charge here is one of filing false affidavits that we cannot be heard to challenge the constitutionality of the statute under which they're filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.835" offset="6656773">We do not think the argument is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.846" offset="6668790">We have dealt with it as carefully as possible in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.655" offset="6692091">The Government has made essentially here two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.434" offset="6707137">First, they draw an analogy to the privilege against self-incrimination and say that if a man has on the stand and would be entitled to invoke the Fifth -- the privilege against self-incrimination, but does not and proceeds to ask the question and answered it falsely he can be indicted to perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.166" offset="6786132">Of course, we don't contest that proposition, but it seems to us wholly extraneous to anything here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.073" offset="6809746">In the case, the privilege against self-incrimination, there is no problem of the authority of the tribunal to put the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.140" offset="6833988">This is a matter of personal privilege which under circumstances of possible self-incrimination gives a person privilege not to answer but it has nothing to do with the authority of the tribunal to put the question, the question may be highly relevant to the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.915" offset="6905041">Whereas here, the whole problem is whether there was any authority to demand this information at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.912" offset="6941090">The Government's other contention here is based upon two cases decided by this Court around 1933, a little later, 302 U.S. and 303 U.S., United States against Kapp, United States against Kay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.089" offset="7001799">These were cases, one under the Homeowners Loan Act and one under the Agriculture Adjustment Act, where the defendant had gone to seek a bounty from the Government, a bounty or a benefit and had gotten it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.358" offset="7050804">He got a benefit payment under the Agriculture Adjustment Act or false statement have been submitted to the Home Owners' Loan Corporation as a basis for a loan and the Court said there that having done that, he could not escape a perjury charge or false statement charge by challenging the overall constitutionality of the AAA Act or the Home Owner's Loan Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.120" offset="7153936">Well, that is very far moved from our situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.408" offset="7175043">This is no case where the defendants have gone seeking any bounty or privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.136" offset="7197926">The labor -- the Taft-Hartley Act was a Regulatory Act imposing restrictions on what unions and management could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.993" offset="7233348">The Douds case itself, the opinion for the Court made it quite clear that this is to be regarded as a restrictive statute, not one conferring any benefits on those subject to it and the Government's position really amounts to this, that the Government can at any time pose a demand for information to an individual and force him to the alternative of either disclosing the information or engaging in litigation with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.873" offset="7360930">No matter how unconstitutional, no matter how unauthorized the demand for information, the defendant can be put to that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.969" offset="7397292">Well, we suggest that that would lead to very arbitrary and oppressive consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.150" offset="7429998">We have detailed our argument on the reply brief and I shall leave it at that point and go to our third point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.468" offset="7475242">I am now away from the validity of the indictment and on the question of the access to the grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.193" offset="7510141">This question of access to grand jury minutes of government witnesses was argued here a few years ago in the Travis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.124" offset="7549952">The Court didn't reach it because the case went off on grounds of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.554" offset="7571686">The problem stems from the Court's decision in Pittsburgh Plate Glass and the ensuing practice in the Circuit Courts following that decision which has been far from uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.756" offset="7628424">Now, as we understand the Pittsburgh Plate Glass decision, it held that if a defendant in a criminal trial where a witness has testified against him -- who has testified against him has also testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.963" offset="7693312">If the defendant requests access to the grand jury testimony for purposes of impeachment, direct the access by the defendant is conditioned on showing of particularized need, is the phrase used in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.743" offset="7760394">In Pittsburgh Plate Glass, the contention was also made here that regardless of production of the minutes to the defendant, that they should have been produced to the Court for scrutiny in camera to decide whether anything in their would be useful for impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.774" offset="7832492">The Court in Pittsburgh Plate Glass didn't raise that question -- didn't reached that question because apparently the contention had not been made at the trial and therefore, the opinion did not reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.125" offset="7873870">It left open, whether any particular showing should be required as a basis for in camera examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.353" offset="7910860">Because of this conceptual dichotomy in the opinion, at the trial in the present case, we made our motion in the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.645" offset="7952029">If the Court would care to see the terms in which the motion was initially made, the record at page 64 has the initial colloquy following the first witness and it will be seen there that we made a motion in the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.156" offset="8014096">We asked first that the witness signed and testified in court and before the grand jury that the minutes being made available directly to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.225" offset="8054324">That if the Court would not grant that motion then police with the Court itself examine the minutes in camera and turnover to us any minutes which they thought to contain testimony that would be useful for impeachment purposes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="2675.576" offset="10807735">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.670" offset="10828110">Petitioners have been convicted of violating the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 371 and under this Court's limited grant of certiorari, three separate grounds for reversal are presently being asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.735" offset="10888401">Petitioner's contentions have been presented in their briefs and in ours and in petitioner's oral argument in the following sequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.125" offset="10917972">First, they've argued that the indictment under which they were charged was defective in that it accused them of having defraud, conspire to defraud of the United States whereas the body of the indictment alleged a conspiracy which did not require for defraud, in other words a conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.227" offset="10998324">Second, petitioners have argued that their convictions are unconstitutional because Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act which imposed the underlying affidavit requirement was an impermissible exercise of legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.715" offset="11052241">And their third contention has been that their trial was improperly conducted in that procedural error was committed with respect to the grand jury testimony of government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.086" offset="11097799">Before discussing each of these three contentions, I think it is important to call to the Court's attention the difference between each of them in terms of the result -- of the resulting judgments if any of them should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.661" offset="11156104">Taking first the grand jury contention, if there were a reversal on that ground alone that would mean at most a new trial under the present indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.977" offset="11201348">And as I will try later to explain our view of course that a remand would be sufficient, but at most it would mean a new trial under the present indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.550" offset="11235621">It would leave undetermined the question whether the indictment is valid and whether a prosecution such as this one is constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.866" offset="11272923">The constitutional challenge is the other extreme because that would, if successful, bar any further prosecution of these petitioners for the offense alleged in the indictment and the first ground asserted by the petitioner is the alleged flaw in the indictment caused for it to have a different result and that the evidence could then be represented to a new grand jury which despite the lapse of the limitations period would be entitled to enter a fresh indictment and then under charging an offense to commit to United States under 18 U.S.C 3288 which authorizes re-indictment in case of a flaw in the indictment after the lapse of limitations period and there would then be a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.598" offset="11443764">Now I call these differences to the Court's attention because it appears to us that from the vantage point of sound judicial administration, the three issues before the Court might well be considered in the order in which they would most probably obviate any need for unnecessary duplication or repetitive later trials since the -- both the constitutional issue and the statutory questions would not be mooted simply by remanding the case for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.209" offset="11554210">In other words, basic to the right to try these petitioners is the constitutional challenge and if as we believe there's no merit to that constitutional claim, it would nonetheless be vain to retry them under the present indictment if there was still a cloud over the question whether they could be tried for conspiracy-to-defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.385" offset="11638951">Consequently, if the Courts please, I should like to discuss first the constitutional claim which really our basic proposition is, that it is not a constitutional claim at all or at least that the resolution of the constitutional issue would not affect the validity of the petitioner's convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.782" offset="11704571">Then second, the alleged flaw in the indictment, and finally, the district judge's treatment of the motions regarding the witnesses' grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.312" offset="11742710">Now we particularly urge that the questions be considered in this order, because the convictions presently before the Court are the result of a second trial of these petitioners and it is now almost ten years since the indictment was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.063" offset="11805717">Our position of course is, that none of the three contentions warrants reversal of the judgments of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.375" offset="11830899">That we also believe that it would not be in the interest either of petitioners or of the Government to remand this case or in the interest of judicial administration and the conservation of judicial resources to remand this case without -- if the case will remand for a new trial without removing the clouds that are presented by the constitutional issue and by the statutory claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.019" offset="11929537">I turn therefore first to the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.677" offset="11944166">The Taft-Hartley Amendments of 1947 added to the National Labor Relations Act, Section 9 (h), was in turn repealed the 1959 with the Landrum-Griffin Act of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.611" offset="11995888">That provision states that the National Labor Relations Board shall make no investigation and issue no complaint on behalf of members of the union or on behalf of the union itself, unless that union or its members or its officers have filed with the Board affidavits of each of the officers stating that he is not a member of the Communist Party or affiliated with the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.240" offset="12098393">Petitioners were convicted on a one-count indictment which charged them with having conspired in violation of the General Conspiracy Statute to defraud the National Labor Relations Board by filing -- first, by filing false affidavits, second, obtaining a certificate of compliance and then third, using the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board with knowledge of the underlying fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.853" offset="12192852">Their claim is that because Section 9 (h) is allegedly unconstitutional, that constitutional infirmity vitiates their convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.433" offset="12231199">Our principal position is that the constitutionality of Section 9 (h) does not affect the validity of petitioner's convictions at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.492" offset="12271428">It is important in this regard to consider what Section 9 (h) commands to the extent that it has a command and what the petitioners are convicted of having done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.434" offset="12315105">Section 9 (h) conditioned the availability of the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board on the filing of non-Communist affidavits by union officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.143" offset="12357945">It said to officers in effect, if you want your union to enjoy the facilities of the Labor Board, you must be prepared to file non-Communist affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.750" offset="12396398">To the extent that Section 9 (h) could be violated at all, it can be said something violated, it had a self-executing sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.680" offset="12436104">In other words, if officers violated it, if they've failed to file affidavits, their union was barred from enjoying the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.360" offset="12482811">But the petitioners were not charged in having violated Section 9 (h) which could be done by not filing affidavits with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.251" offset="12518442">What they were charged with was a separate and distinct offense which was conspiring to defraud by filing false statements with the Government upon which governmental action was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.866" offset="12576852">Their constitutional claim, if it were sound, meant really nothing more that they were entitled to challenge Section 9 (h) by ignoring the statute, by not filing any affidavits, but it did not mean that they could lawfully commit an entirely separate and distinct offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.811" offset="12656682">Assume for example, hypothetically, that petitioners on this record had decided instead of that -- instead of filing false affidavits, they would prevent the impact of Section 9 (h) upon their union by bribing the official of the National Labor Relations Board who was in charged of the records of the Board with regard to such affidavits, and bribing him to have him alter the records in order to reflect that they had filed the affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.200" offset="12766187">It seems entirely clear to us that it would not be a defense to bribery prosecution in such circumstances for them to say “Oh we didn't have to file any affidavits at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.772" offset="12824492">Their lawful response to the -- to the requirement that they file affidavits if they had a constitutional challenge to that requirement, was not to file the affidavits and to do what the plaintiffs did in American Communication Association versus Doud, which is the case in which this Court did pass in a proper procedural context on the constitution -- very same constitutional challenge make here by petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="3632.847" offset="14636763">We think the -- our argument in this regard is really -- makes this case very similar for example to this Court's decision in United States versus Williams, which involved a -- the question, the validity of a perjury charge, made against a witness who had testified allegedly falsely in a criminal trial on an indictment which did not as this Court held state of federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.646" offset="14759957">Now presumably the Court in that case, in the Williams case, did not have in one sense jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.658" offset="14788065">They couldn't proceed to try that case and yet, witnesses who appeared before it, if they were to make that kind of a challenge, certainly couldn't even contest the Court's jurisdiction before they were able to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.492" offset="14859431">And yet this Court held in Williams that that did not give them the option of committing the entirely distinct and separate crime of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.476" offset="14895376">The Kapp and Kay cases are not as General Taylor suggested, separate branches of our argument, they were all -- we believe they were all welded in, they're part of the very same proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.662" offset="14948039">In Kapp, the defendants had been charged with conspiring to defraud the United States by submitting false claims under the Agriculture Adjustment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.092" offset="14981789">Presumably, those claims were nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.839" offset="14992760">The Agriculture Adjustment Act had been declared unconstitutional by the time the case -- that the validity of that indictment was determined by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.605" offset="15043856">And yet this Court held that despite the fact that the Agriculture Adjustment Act was unconstitutional, that did not give the defendants in that case a license to commit a separate and distinct crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.656" offset="15104042">Essentially, at the heart of our argument is the very same proposition we think -- or the very same broad principle which is -- which underlies this Court's decision in the United Mine Workers case, which is that there are certain lawful responses which may be made to demands or requests of courts or governmental agencies which may be impermissible, whether because of lack of jurisdiction or whether because of a constitutional challenge, and the permissible responses are not to be the -- either not to respond to the demand or to take whatever minimum steps are necessary in order to present the constitutional claim in appropriate litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.267" offset="15298497">But a constitutional challenge does not, under our system, give the person who is subject to the allegedly unconstitutional demand, the option of committing a whole range of -- a broad range of crimes, simply in order to avoid the impact of what he claims is an unconstitutional request or demand and that we think is what is in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.847" offset="15392852">If the Government -- if the Labor Board under Section 9 (h) did not have the power to demand these affidavits, petitioners' option was not to submit affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.711" offset="15448231">They could not bribe the Labor Board employee nor could they submit false affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.628" offset="15467980">A court which has no jurisdiction may not under the United Mine Workers case, cavalierly disobey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.135" offset="15493998">An agency which has cons -- no constitutional power, may not under this Court's decision in Kapp be cheated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.049" offset="15533599">A court which is trying to charge which did not amount to a federal crime may not under Williams be lied to and there are many cases which we've cited in our brief or considerable number of case that we've cited in our brief, which involved grand jury's calling witnesses without informing them of their privilege against self-incrimination and then putting questions to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.194" offset="15646239">In one sense, the questions certainly in those cases are unauthorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.125" offset="15661913">The witness, who is ignorant of his privilege against self-incrimination, presumably doesn't have the option of refusing to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.809" offset="15688662">He doesn't know what it is he can do and what his lawful rights are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.221" offset="15710292">And yet, courts have held that a false answer under those circumstances amounts to perjury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3920.576" offset="15787719">Well, I think it might be different in First Amendment case if possibly Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.446" offset="15807154">In other words, possibly the mere obligation of answering of any kind if a witness is ignorant, certainly if he's ignorant of his various options, he ought not in any way to be penalized for what it is that he's answering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.248" offset="15906419">But I think in this case, even if it involved First Amendment rights, the petitioners had the advice of counsel, they knew what it is that their choices were and indeed, I don't think that there's probably no doubt that they consciously chose to file affidavits rather than not file them and make a constitutional challenge in an appropriate proceeding because they knew that it -- they may be appropriate challenge, it would then -- have been rejected under the Douds case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.931" offset="16029194">So that they -- they made in this case a very knowing choice when they determined that they would file false affidavits rather than not filing the affidavits at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.327" offset="16078723">I think it's possible that in certain First Amendment context if a -- if they -- a person who has asked the question does not have the advice of counsel and does not know what his options are it might very well be unfair or possibly constitutionally impermissible then to prosecute him because the answer turns out to be false, but I don't think that's this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.201" offset="16190213">On the merits of the constitutional claim, I would like to make these two points, after noting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.159" offset="16226053">First of course, that the ground that the majority of the Court or in Douds determine that Section 9 (h) was constitutional or was not a bill of attainder, was of course pro tanto overruled in Archie Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.916" offset="16309123">In Douds, the Court adverted to the fact that 9 (h) was not a bill of attainder because it operated only prospectively and to that extent, this Court has overruled that portion under Douds holding in the Archie Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.743" offset="16384355">However, I do think it is important to note that in the bill of attainder cases and particularly in the Lovett case, there was heavy emphasis placed by the Court on the question of whether what Congress was doing amounted to punishment and it was held in Lovett that notwithstanding the fact that the sanction was not a criminal one it nonetheless did amount to punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.667" offset="16496055">In this case, in 9 (h) we believe that the Court in Douds held that it was the effect of the affidavit requirement was a discouragement and that's the Court's language and we submit that to that extent, 9 (h) is distinguishable from the successor statute in Section 504 of the Landrum-Griffin Act because it is merely a discouragement and this Court in a footnote in the Aptheker case, made that very distinction between Douds and the statute that was before them in Aptheker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.010" offset="16653416">And we think that that would be a ground for distinguishing 9 (h) from the Archie Brown statute in bill of attainder terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.154" offset="16698034">With regard to General Taylor's reference to this Court's recent decision in Elfbrandt, of course this indictment did not allege specific intent because what petitioners were being charged with was not mere membership in a Communist Party or anything that would have required a showing of specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.912" offset="16801061">They were charged with having lied in the statements of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.033" offset="16813599">They said to the Government that they had -- they were not members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.475" offset="16831363">The only material question is whether they were members of the Communist Party and whether that statement if they were not was a lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.287" offset="16862605">Consequently specific intent in the indictment or in the proof was a -- would have been any relevance.</text>

            <text syncTime="4790.045" offset="19265557">Really, I think what the Court was concerned about in Bridges was the fact that almost any conspiracy-to-defraud encompasses lots of subs -- commission of substantive offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="5516.242" offset="22170373">One -- the first ground is that the Bridges case was concerned as the Court made entirely clear that with the construction of the War-time Suspension of Limitations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.172" offset="22210079">It said this was a statute which had been opposed for a very limited number of cases. In other words -- and said it was -- it should be given conservative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.418" offset="22247069">And the question was, whether Acts such as those alleged in the indictment in Bridges, amounting to a fraud within the meaning of that Suspension of Limitations Act and the Court held that they did not amount to a fraud within the meaning of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.359" offset="22302866">Now have the Court held as petitioners now contend that that could not even have amounted to a conspiracy-to-defraud at all, presumably the Court could have -- or petitioners in that case would have been moved to dismiss the indictment altogether as they did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.207" offset="22362216">The Court didn't dismiss the indictment in Bridges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.651" offset="22372039">It didn't say it was -- it improperly charges an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.407" offset="22383010">It said only that it did not come with the union Suspension of Limitations which that very limited statute provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.980" offset="22417387">And our second ground for distinguishing Bridges is that on fact, Bridges really did not involve anything more than a conspiracy to commit three substantive offenses and there was nothing more alleged in the conspiracy count then that the conspirators had, as part of their conspiracy committed each of those three substantive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5596.753" offset="22492411">In this case, the second and third portions of the conspiracy are not substantive offenses at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5602.299" offset="22514667">And for that reason, we think it's properly charged them as fraud on the United States and not merely a substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.662" offset="22572032">In addition, we think that it's entirely clear not only from the first portion of the indictment but from the overt acts which are alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.700" offset="22600244">That much more was charged in the indictment than a conspiracy to violate 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.123" offset="22617903">Overt acts, 4, 7, 14 and 15, all deal with the use of National Labor Relations Board facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.729" offset="22652385">Now, had we charged as petitioners now contend in the indictment, nothing more than a conspiracy to file false affidavits, it would be hard to see how the testimony or the agreement that the -- signatures of various conspirators to National Labor Relations Board documents would be overt acts in furtherance of that conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.252" offset="22774429">So altogether, we submit, it's quite clear that the base of the indictment charged a conspiracy-to-defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.406" offset="22811000">Now petitions also contend well that no conspiracy-to-defraud could have been committed here because the National Labor Relations Board does not have the power to look behind the truth of these affidavits and then to place the union in decompliance under this Court's decision in the Leedom and Mine, Mill case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.940" offset="22897204">How we think that looks at the whole regulatory scheme from the wrong point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.790" offset="22924581">The question isn't whether a -- the Labor Board after at false affidavits have been filed had the power to go back and determine whether they're true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.504" offset="22963451">The question is that as of the time these affidavits are filed, as of the time the representation is made, would the Board be acting if the truth were told in those affidavits?</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.712" offset="23008277">And the answer is entirely clear that the Board under 9 (h) would not have the power to act if the truth had been told in the affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5732.710" offset="23036280">If these petitioners had signed an affidavit which under the proof here would have been a truthful affidavits stating that they were members of the Communist Party, the Board could not have gone ahead and offered them the services and facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="5948.579" offset="23899784">Now, we submit that an analysis here must begin with what this Court said in the Procter and Gamble case which is that we start with a wrong established policy that maintains the secrecy of grand jury proceedings in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.399" offset="23959030">Now grand jury minutes are in the first instance intended to be secret and we think that rule succeeds.</text>

            <text syncTime="6016.181" offset="24170099">There's no policy -- no traditional policy of secrecy regarding that but there is a governmental policy which presumably can be waived by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="6230.103" offset="25025870">All that we argued really is that in order to justify even an in camera inspection, the imposition that this puts on the trial judge, the defendants should be required to say something and point to some particular matter in the witnesses' testimony or some -- some specific item which he things would justify an in camera inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6251.662" offset="25112074">Now on this case, petitioners have managed to do so very successfully in this Court, but if the trial transcript is examined, they didn't make nearly the same showing in the trial court as they've done here in the various illustrations in their brief and those showings could have been made in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.620" offset="25191905">Generally, the statements made in the trial court were that -- all that the witnesses' testimony knows with declarations that it -- the specific wording of the declarations might be important and a general allegation of inconsistency with prior testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="6286.009" offset="25249479">But in this case or in this Court, petitioners have pointed to specific alleged inconsistencies between public testimony of the witnesses which they did not do in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6299.313" offset="25302664">And we think that the transcript reflects and quite clearly that the Court was willing if there had been or any real attempt made to have them examine this transcript to really look at the transcripts but no real attempt was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6312.656" offset="25356058">And in any event, we submit that no harm could possibly be done to petitioners if the case were now remanded after the District Judge look at those minutes to certify whether there were inconsistencies which would have justified any motive of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6325.564" offset="25407676">General Taylor has pointed to the fact that one of the witnesses, Mr. Mason died between the first and second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.468" offset="25431291">Well all what that means is that the District Judge agreed to grand jury transcript and compares it with the testimony of the first trial determines whether there were any inconsistencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6341.213" offset="25470265">Certainly if you find that there were no inconsistencies that doesn't vitiate this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.663" offset="25488029">If you were to find that were no inconsistencies then the petitioners were not entitled for the grand jury transcript at neither at the first trial nor the second trial and the convictions could stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="6362.394" offset="25555007">I would like to deal with a few of the questions that the Court put during the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6369.062" offset="25581652">Firstly, with the questions that had to do with the statutory point and then on the question of our situation with respect to constitutional contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.199" offset="25622194">And may I begin with the questions that the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice White, I think especially, were putting with regard to why this indictment was brought under the fraud clause rather than under the offense clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6395.110" offset="25685828">We deal with that in our brief at page 19 and the explanation as I think reasonably clear and the sequence not without interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.219" offset="25726265">I mentioned in reply to Mr. Justice Stewart's question that there was one other conspiracy case like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.600" offset="25755836">That Mr. Justice Stewart was brought under the offense clause of the conspiracy statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="6418.959" stopTime="6422.238">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="6418.959" offset="25781227">That conspires -- that conspiracy to violate 1001, is that it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="telford_taylor" startTime="6422.238" stopTime="6624.710">
            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="6422.238" offset="25794393">Yes and the sequence is that this indictment in our case came in November of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="6430.394" offset="25826994">In December of 1956, this Court decided the Leedom case which held that the Labor Board didn't have any interest in the truth or falsity of these affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6442.041" offset="25873596">And the West indictment, that's the other conspiracy case was brought in January of 1957 and was brought under the offense clause of the conspiracy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6452.737" offset="25916332">And it seems to us clear enough that the Leedom case underlying the doubts which we thought should have existed before with respect to the validity of an indictment under the fraud clause so the Government shifted to the other and safer clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.483" offset="25979340">Now, the first one was brought under the fraud clause, we believe does have to do with the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.640" offset="26011941">Whether it would have been successful in that respect isn't that matter of course, but the Court did say in the Grainger case that the statute of limitations on conspiracy to commit an offense cannot be any longer than on the offense itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6492.429" offset="26075157">Well some of these affidavits go back to 1949 in the indictment and not until 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="6497.765" offset="26096473">So there obviously was a problem with respect to statute limitations which may account the initial indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.619" offset="26123849">Now Mr. Justice Stewart I'd like to go on with the question that you've put with respect to this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6511.712" offset="26152270">Mr. Lewin said in reply to your question that this indictment is not brought under 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="6521.649" offset="26191976">Of course it doesn't refer to 1001, there's no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6525.617" offset="26207859">However, my dimension that this -- that Section 9 (h) does have in it a sanction and the sanction is 1001, it's incorporated by this explicit mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6539.799" offset="26264597">The last sentence in 9 (h) is, the provisions of Sections blank, blank, 1001, 1022 and 1023, shall be applicable in respect to such affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6551.556" offset="26311617">So that there is a built-in incorporation by explicit reference to 1001 and therefore there's not a slightest difficulty in indicting in the circumstances for -- under the offense clause as well as under the fraud clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6567.455" offset="26375252">Now, coming back to the Bridges case, the distinction which Mr. Lewin has suggested here that the Bridges case had to do with the Suspension Act and therefore is irrelevant to our present problem, I don't think would stand analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6588.154" offset="26458008">Mr. Lewin says that if the Suspension Act haven't been involved there that the indictment would have stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="6597.791" offset="26496564">Well, there are other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6601.464" offset="26511297">The Hammerschmidt case decided in 1926 involved no problem with statute limitations, no Suspension Act, it was a case where the Government prosecuted for conspiracy-to-defraud by obstructing registrants from military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6618.538" offset="26579529">Dismissed as a failure to state any fraud element, no statute of limitations involved --</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="6633.545" offset="26639611">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6634.949" offset="26645253">But the [Inaudible] case I think shows -- it shows -- it seems to me clearly enough that regardless of the presence or absence of the statute of limitations problem, if the elements aren't made out, the indictment must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6648.408" offset="26699065">And the Bridges case tells us that in determining whether fraud is made out, you don't look simply at what the indictment says.</text>
            <text syncTime="6657.045" offset="26733652">You look at what is in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.513" offset="26743474">Now, Mr. Lewin has said there's a lot more in this indictment beside the violation of 10001.</text>
            <text syncTime="6665.934" offset="26769178">And of course there are indeed a lot more paragraphs, but the only unlawful element involved here is the false affidavit nothing else in it has anything to do with an unlawful conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6678.799" offset="26820587">Indeed, this again is just like the Bridges case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6681.883" offset="26832917">In Bridges, the first count said that Bridges was charged with conspiring to defraud the United States by making a false answer and thereby getting a naturalization certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6696.828" offset="26892685">These things about the use of the Board and all that, they are the normal fruits of false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6704.775" offset="26924554">I don't suppose anybody makes some just as I put in our reply brief that followed it, but there would have been no conspiracy here, there's no unlawful element at all other than the false affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6716.876" offset="26972933">And that is an offense under 10001 and fraud is not an element of it and this Court had said so repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.183" offset="27002190">And the Government I think saw the -- saw the point after the Leedom case and therefore switched to the other clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6733.650" offset="27040016">Now, with respect to our constitutional contentions and whether we can bring them to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6743.227" offset="27078363">Mr. Justice Fortas' remarked that this is not a question of standing but of relevance and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6753.464" offset="27119323">It seems to us that the Government's point it is – arguing the statutory point, says that 10001 is something quite different from 9 (h) and when their argument constitutional point says -- said that's one and the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6770.046" offset="27185570">There could be no indictment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6772.969" offset="27197273">There would be no compulsion to file an affidavit, no pressure to file an affidavit but for 9 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="6779.023" offset="27221514">No affidavit would have been filed but for 9 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="6782.635" offset="27235934">And therefore, it doesn't seem to me that there's any problem with irrelevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.736" offset="27252339">Now the Kapp and Kay cases do say that under the circumstances there, the defendants were not entitled to challenge the constitutionality of those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6799.477" offset="27303330">The circumstances though I suggest were quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6803.871" offset="27320884">In the Kay case which deals with this problem most clearly, involving the Home Owners Loan Corporation, the defendant indicted was -- the charge was that she -- who had a second mortgage on property, had overstated the amount of that mortgage in an application to the Home Owners Loan Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6825.997" offset="27409387">The Court said that her challenge to the validity of the entire statute would not lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.023" offset="27441465">That since she had sought benefits under it, she was not entitled to raise the question of the constitutionality of the entire scheme of Home Owners Loan Act, but that she was entitled to challenge the constitutionality of the particular sections of that Act under which her showing to the Government had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.499" offset="27531431">And indeed the case did explicitly pass on the constitutionality of Sections 8 (a) and 8 (e) of the Home Owners Loan Act which were the relevant and governing sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="6868.765" offset="27580437">It was only the overall challenge to the statute which the Government -- which the Court would not hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6874.956" offset="27605201">This part of our argument is dealt with in some detail in our reply brief at pages 6 to 10, and may I just burden the Court by pointing out there is a misstatement on page 8 which renders that paragraph meaningless the word sanctions should be situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.526" offset="27695480">The Kapp and the Kay case involved situations where the defendants want to see the validity or benefit from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.620" offset="27719931">The Government's position does amount to a contention that when an unconstitutional, unauthorized inquiry is made, a person must either disclose or litigate, or at least risk litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6918.112" offset="27777818">Now I quite agree with Mr. Lewin that the appropriate and best kind of conduct in that situation is indeed to disclose or to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6929.052" offset="27821599">But it seems to us that to hold people in general to those standards is utterly unrealistic and highly oppressive in this potentialities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6942.118" offset="27873844">This again we've dealt with on page 10 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6946.394" offset="27890981">If this is so, I don't see why all kinds of questions clearly put to people in some of these forms, service on juries, racial questions, questions of religion are the matters quite beyond authorize scrutiny and put everyone to the hazard of answering truthfully or litigate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.522" offset="27971542">It seems to us the consequences speak for themselves and the -- this Court shall [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="6972.280" offset="27994530">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
