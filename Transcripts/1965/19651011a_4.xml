            <text syncTime="28.551" offset="217527">Mr. Harris.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_g_harris" startTime="31.569" stopTime="886.211">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="31.569" offset="229648">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.071" offset="247620">In this matter, we have had, within the past several months, the decision of this Court in Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Company versus New Jersey Wood Finishing which was cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.122" offset="303835">In that case, the test laid down by this Court for determining the question of tolling was stated to be “was the conduct challenged by the plaintiff complained of in the government action?”</text>
            <text syncTime="69.356" offset="380844">As stated at page 323 of the Minnesota Mining case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.317" offset="408639">I submit to the Court that the conduct challenged by the plaintiff was complained of in the government action and referred to the overt acts challenged by the plaintiff and contrast them with the overt acts or conduct complained of by the Government in the following particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.906" offset="511039">In the plaintiffs' complaint, we alleged overt acts consisting of, among others, controlling the sale and distribution of refined gasoline in the Southern California area, denying independent jobbers access to a source of supply of refined gasoline, preventing independent jobbers from obtaining refined gasoline from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.551" offset="601527">The government complaint, on the other hand, at paragraphs 70 (b) (6), (7), (8), (10), (11), (12), and (15), charges the defendants there named with foreclosing independent wholesale and retail markets otherwise available to independent refiners by requiring independent jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers to handle exclusively the refined petroleum products of the defendant majors.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.067" offset="719600">Again, the plaintiffs' complaint states as an overt act that the defendants prevented the customers of independent jobbers to retailers from obtaining gasoline with which to compete with retail service stations and outlets operated or controlled by the defendants there named.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.302" offset="804551">The government complaint, on the other hand, charges the defendants there named with maintaining agreed upon wholesale and retail prices by refusing to sell gasoline to any wholesale or retail distributors who refuse to follow the prices fixed and by adopting the uniformed policy of refusing to sell gasoline to any wholesale distributor, jobber, or retail dealer who would not agree to sell the products of a single dependent major on an exclusive dealing basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.818" offset="922624">Again, the plaintiffs' complaint charges the defendants with maintaining fixed artificial and uncompetitive prices for the wholesale and retail sale of refined gasoline in the Southern California area.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.227" offset="968286">The government complaint charges the defendants there named in almost identical language with fixing and maintaining uniform and noncompetitive resale prices to the charged consumers by retailers handling gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.073" offset="1023666">The plaintiffs charge as an overt act that the defendants destroyed any substantial competition afforded them in the wholesale and retail selling and marketing of refined gasoline in the Southern California area.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.517" offset="1085419">The government complaint charges the defendants with sharing wholesale and retail markets in the sale of gasoline by standardizing the various grades, qualities, and structure of gasoline and by selling gasoline and other refined products at identical prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.757" offset="1146441">The plaintiffs' complaint in the private case charges the defendants as an overt act with controlling the sources of refined gasoline in the Southern California area, and preventing and precluding independent jobbers from obtaining source and supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.765" offset="1206418">The government complaint, on the other hand, charges the defendants with fixing and maintaining uniform and noncompetitive prices for the sale of gasoline by causing the posting of an agreed price for each type and grade of gasoline at wholesale distribution points and by causing each other to post and charge identical prices at such points.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.718" offset="1282278">Now, from a comparison of those overt acts alleged by the plaintiff in the private case with the comparison of the charges by the Government in the government case, it is submitted that the test of this Court in Minnesota Mining, to with, was the conduct challenged by the plaintiff complained of in the government action, is more than satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.050" offset="1383528">However, the respondents in this case address themselves to three distinctions which they urge differentiate that conduct which has just been compared.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.835" offset="1442670">Distinction number one is that the complaint in the government case charges a conspiracy commencing in or about the year 1936, whereas, the complaint in the private case charges a conspiracy commencing in or about the year 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.802" offset="1530546">Now, again, in addressing myself to this distinction, I do so by asking, “Is the Government complaining of conduct in 1936 or is the Government complaining of conduct at all times and including 1948 and right up until, and including 1950, the time of filing of the government antitrust action?”</text>
            <text syncTime="383.838" offset="1638693">In my references, I will refer to the appendix filed by respondents of the government complaint since it's -- since it's in a brief form rather than the typewritten record on which this case is being presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.223" offset="1684250">In answer to that question of 1936 versus 1948 and what the government was complaining about when it filed its complaint in 1950, I refer first to the appendix at page 40, which takes up at that point at paragraph number 21 of the government complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.164" offset="1768051">At that point, the Government, in its complaint, points out that the Conservation Committee of California Oil Producers had its inception in 1930 but that the present committee was organized in 1936 and goes on to state, in effect, its formation constituted merely a reorganization of predecessor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.539" offset="1861569">So that, the 1936 date used in the government complaint, I submit, is clarified as the date upon which the Conservation Committee of Oil Producers was reorganized.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.545" offset="1913501">At page 49 and 50 of the appendix, commencing at numbered paragraphs 46 of the government complaint, it is to be emphasized, that in describing the commerce and trade affected, the government is not talking about something that happened in 1936 as a static and frozen thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.247" offset="2008377">The Government says, as of January 1, 1949, there were approximately 64 crude oil refineries.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.259" offset="2036381">Their complying crude oil import -- input was so many barrels per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.234" offset="2056338">Again, further on that, as of January 1, 1949, there were so many barrels refined from the refineries that were opened and 17 refineries were, at that point, idle.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.355" offset="2108792">At pages 52 and -- at page 50, rather, numbered paragraph 50, during 1948 the total gasoline produced by refiners in the Pacific States area was approximately 120 million barrels, at which defendant majors produced and sold approximately 108 million barrels for approximately 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.075" offset="2195623">At pages 52 and 55 of the appendix, numbered paragraph 56, the Government, in concluding the description of the trade and commerce affected, uses these very significant paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.473" offset="2253302">And it is to be emphasized that it was emphasized by this Court in the Minnesota Mining case where the Court might recall there was an argument made that the Federal Trade Commission, in that case, was put to a burden only of showing a possible effect on competition, whereas, the plaintiff was put to the burden of showing an actual effect on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.875" offset="2342849">And, the Court pointed out as a significant factor that the Federal Trade Commission had alleged both in terms of possible and positive effect that is that there could be restraint and that there was a restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.926" offset="2387048">So, also, the Government in this case alleges speaking in the present tense, not about 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.262" offset="2416410">Each defendant major requires independent distributors who handled its refined petroleum products to deal exclusively in the refined petroleum products of said defendant major, and to refrain from dealing in the petroleum products of independent refiners and marketers.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.500" offset="2473357">Each defendant major also requires the independent distributors handling its refined petroleum products to sell said products to retail dealers and to large consumers at prices fixed by defendant majors, and otherwise, to conduct their business in the manner desired by defendant majors.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.993" offset="2543365">At page 55, each of the defendant majors -- this is numbered paragraph 62, each of the defendant majors requires the independent operators who sell its refined petroleum products to purchase the requirements exclusively from the respective defendant major and not to handle or sell the petroleum products of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.037" offset="2623509">At page 58, at the top of the page, except for the area within a three-mile radius of Los Angeles Harbor, defendant majors enjoy, in the present tense, a virtual monopoly in the wholesale and retail sale of gasoline and other refined petroleum products manufactured and sold in the Pacific States area.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.842" offset="2702712">Now, Mr. Kirkham will undoubtedly say that I have quoted up to that point from numbered paragraph 4 of the government complaint which describes the trade and commerce affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.308" offset="2744613">However, I submit that is relevant in determining whether the Government is there talking about 1936, 1948, or 1950, or a combination in a continuing thing going up until June of 1950 and thereafter which they were trying in 1950 to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.918" offset="2815039">However, commencing with paragraph V, charging the actual offenses set down by the Government at page 58, numbered paragraph 69, the actual language used by the Government is the following, “beginning in or about the year 1936 and continuing thereafter up to and including the date of filing the complaint, the defendants have been and now are engaged in a combination and conspiracy to restrain unreasonably,” etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.058" offset="2951607">In numbered paragraph 70, “the actual monopolizations have consisted of continuing agreement and concert of action among the defendants, its potential terms of which have been,” etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.514" offset="3009390">And, again -- and, finally, at page 66, “in concluding immediately before the prayer, the Government accuses the defendants of controlling completely the competition of independent producers, retailers and marketers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="745.190" offset="3084100">And you'll recall that in the brief in opposition in this case, the respondents have said that they wish to ignore everything but the marketing aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.707" offset="3114193">Of course, the Government was concerned with all phases, and I will advert to that shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.928" offset="3139062">But, the Government specifically accuses the defendants of controlling completely the competition of producers, refiners, and marketers.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.634" offset="3169886">The defendant majors' quadruple monopoly of the production, transportation, refining, and marketing of crude oil and refined petroleum products “has stabilized completely the entire oil industry in the Pacific States area and has resulted in the elimination of all price competition in the sale to consumers of gasoline and other refined petroleum products.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.252" offset="3264345">Now, it is submitted, therefore, that Government was concerned with a conspiracy which was in existence at least from 1936 and probably earlier than 1936 date being selected because of the reorganization on that date of the Conservation Committee of California Oil Producers, and was concerned with conduct which was continuing in 1948, 1949, and 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.650" offset="3385971">And that, therefore, with in the test laid down by the Minnesota Mining case of whether the Government was complaining of conduct complained of in the plaintiffs' complaint, the plaintiffs submit that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.733" offset="3442291">As stated by the Court in Philco versus R.C.A, cited in the brief, we see nothing novel in stating a conspiracy within a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.203" offset="3492133">And, indeed, that would seem to be the normal situation in the private antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.874" offset="3518882">In other words, the Government is concerned with conspiracy in a grand manner on a grand scale covering perhaps the nation or in this case, the five western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.974" offset="3571231">The impact of that conspiracy on a local level is what the individual private litigant is concerned with, and it has been referred to several times in this term of conspiracy within a conspiracy or a smaller conspiracy within the large, and seems to be the typical pattern.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.156" offset="4055960">The interesting thing about the idea of a conspiracy within a conspiracy is that it has been used in a much stronger setting than is urged by the plaintiffs in this case, and that setting is under Section 5 (a) rather than Section 5 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.940" offset="4127117">In other words, it has been used as prima facie proof of a local combination or conspiracy from the national combination or conspiracy shown to exist by the Government in the government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.648" offset="4181974">And, I would like to cite two cases not cited in the brief in that particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.147" offset="4199946">The first is Loew's Inc.versus Cinema Amusements, a case in which two of the members of this Court were on the brief, reported at 210 F.2d, page 86, the Tenth Circuit of 1954, page 86 particularly page 90.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.481" offset="4277269">And, Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. versus the Brookside Theatre Corporation, reported at 194 F.2d 846, particularly to 853, 1729 an Eighth Circuit case, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.371" offset="4332857">In those cases, we had the concept of a national conspiracy being proved to exist by the theatre cases which was then applied as prima facie evidence of a local-level conspiracy, and this was again referred to in the Nisley case, which I have set in the brief at page 529 of Nisley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.244" offset="4420315">Now, the Tenth Circuit and Eighth Circuit agreed with that treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.650" offset="4446020">The Seventh Circuit, however, when faced with the problem of whether or not a decree would be used as a prima facie evidence which is, admittedly, a much stronger thing than the plaintiffs are here seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.122" offset="4499832">The Seventh Circuit refused to go along in a hypothetical situation which is stated very clearly in another case not cited in the brief, Sun Theatre Corporation versus RKO, 213 F.2d 284, at page 290, Seventh Circuit, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.000" offset="4575378">In that case, the Court set up a hypothetical complaint and conspiracy in terms of a, b, c, and d as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.213" offset="4624175">If a decree is entered that a, b, c, and d have conspired together on a national scale to eliminate competition, this decree is admissible in plaintiffs' action as prima facie proof of the nationwide conspiracy but not to prove the existence of a conspiracy directly affecting any particular locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.941" offset="4699094">Now, the Tenth and Eight Circuits took exactly the contra view of that particular proposition and said that it was admissible to prove the conspiracy at a local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.935" offset="4743084">However, when the Seventh Circuit addressed itself to the question of tolling at page 291, it said as follows, “our hypothetical complaint charges and our hypothetical decree finds that a, b, c, and d conspired together to eliminate competition on a national scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.777" offset="4806510">The decree is prima facie evidence as to this question only, and then going on very significantly, p rips the full benefit of Section 5 if the statute is suspended as to the parties named.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.078" offset="4855724">So that, apparently, the Seventh Circuit, while refusing to apply the decree as prima facie evidence under Section 5 (a), would nevertheless suspend the statute at a local level under Section 5 (b) which is all that we are seeking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.107" offset="4931793">The second distinction referred to by the defendants is that the conspirators are not identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.131" offset="4963871">Mr. Justice Clark has already pointed out by his questioning and I have stated wherein the conspirators are not at -- conspirators are not identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.232" offset="4996263">Now, this was a relevant test under the Steiner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.160" offset="5016012">However, it is no longer a relevant test under the case of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, as decided by this Court last May, because under that case, of course, we no longer have the rules of or never did have in that case decided that the rules lf collateral estoppel were no longer pertinent under Section 5 (b) while perhaps still pertinent under Section 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.275" offset="5108485">Therefore, whether or not the defendants are or are not the same is not any longer a distinguishing feature, and I think that contention has been completely eliminated by the Minnesota Mining case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.129" offset="5159894">The third distinction urged by the -- the respondents in this case is that the cut-off date, that is our overt act which caused us damage which reached us and hurt us, occurred in 1954, some-four years after the filing of the government complaint in June of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.843" offset="5250696">However, for several reasons, this is a distinction without substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.008" offset="5271385">Number one, the legislative history quoted in the brief, while as I stated in the brief it is somewhat ambiguous, lends credence to the idea that violations occurring after the filing of the government complaint are likewise to be tolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.631" offset="5321853">Number two and more important, as a question of policy, certainly, if this Court, as it has committed itself to do in the Minnesota Mining case, desires to give the full benefit to the private litigant of government antitrust actions, it would be a very strange rule to state that no tolling were to exist after the filing of the government complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.734" offset="5422268">It would be as if by magic, all offenses were to stop with the filling of the government complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.356" offset="5444838">And, in fact, instead of protecting the private person, it would hurt the private person and that it might give the persons charged in the government complaint a right to do things as to which the statute of limitations would run whereas, beforehand, the statute of limitations would be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.141" offset="5519966">Finally, this same situation --</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.631" offset="5625919">There would be no question, assuming that we have the necessary holder in part doctrine under Section 5 (b) complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.745" offset="5658311">There would be no question but there would be a suspension of the running of the statute of limitations on that cause of action for as long as the government case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.029" offset="5691538">In this case, it was filed for a full 10 years, from 1950 to 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.054" offset="5707630">However, if the Court were to adopt the doctrine and say that any overt acts happening after June of 1950 are not suspended so that, let's say, in 1954, as in our case, we were cut off, we alleged, the statute of limitations would run on us and we would be barred using the four-year statute which is now uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.942" offset="5783176">We would regard in 1958, whereas the cause of action which accrued in 1949 would continue merrily on its way until 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.053" offset="5811597">That is to say, 10 years, the period of the Government's suit plus the one year extra allowed, which is a very anomalous result and I'm certain that's not one that was intended by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.859" offset="6046804">Our cause of action arose in 1954 while the government suit was pending.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.037" offset="6243558">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.906" offset="6262993">At the outset, I should say that there are no disputed issues of law that remain in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.885" offset="6314924">We have no disagreement as far as this particular case is concerned with any of the tests that have been urged by petitioners, either in their brief or at the oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.544" offset="6381589">The only question that remains, is one of fact on the test that we concede to be the same as those that petitioner has stated, was the plaintiffs' complaint in this case based in whole or in part on any matter complained of in the Government's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.370" offset="6464867">The Government's suit was brought in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.480" offset="6481272">The plaintiff alleges -- plaintiff in a suit brought in 1956, during the pendency of the government case which was finally settled in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.683" offset="6526098">The suit brought by plaintiff in 1956 alleged a conspiracy commencing in or about 1948 which injured him in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.441" offset="6577089">In appraising the relationship between the two cases, one matter should be kept in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.658" offset="6610004">The case was filed in 1956 in the same Court in which the Government's action had been pending for six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.912" offset="6643022">The government case was familiar to the plaintiff and if there had been a cause of action which plaintiff deemed -- plaintiffs deemed was one that was complained of by the Government, certainly, they had the full opportunity to plead at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.850" offset="6702791">Secondly, pretrial proceedings have occurred over the course of more than six years, thousands of pages of discovery, and the decision of the Court upon this motion was made in the District Court after the discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.559" offset="6777605">There -- certain facts have come out which are undisputed, which served to clarify, in part, the situation of parties upon the complaint itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.235" offset="6820342">In the first place, as petitioners up here stated, petitioners are what are called rebrand jobbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.534" offset="6865481">In California, as in many states, gasoline is sold by the major oil companies under the major oil brand, Standard Gasoline, Union Gasoline, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.938" offset="6907173">Under the statute of the State of California, that gasoline may be sold to an independent jobber and rebranded, if permission is given, and that is the familiar gasoline seen usually in the stations of independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.140" offset="6963911">The Standard of California might sell to a rebrand jobber of gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.304" offset="6980629">That will be rebranded and resold as Gilmore Gasoline and its station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.332" offset="7000691">Now, the essence of petitioners' complaint in this case is that the defendants in this case conspired to eliminate this type of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.601" offset="7061817">He was a member of the class of rebrand jobbers and the defendants conspired to eliminate him from competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.065" offset="7103613">If we turn to the allegations of the complaint in this case which is set out at page 18 of our appendix, the aforesaid combination -- I'm now reading the plaintiffs' case, “the aforesaid combination conspiracy to restrain trade and commerce, and so on, consisted of the following agreement and concert of action, (a) agreed to exclude independent jobbers of refined gasoline from the distribution of refined gasoline throughout Southern California area by forcing such independent jobbers out of the market, eliminating a source of supply of refined gasoline to such independent jobbers, eliminating all competition by or from such independent jobbers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.346" offset="7300786">There followed then, numbered paragraphs, through (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.439" offset="7325132">And, the only important or significant addition to the allegations that I've read in (a) are that, in the succeeding paragraphs, the complaint alleges an agreement to eliminate the customers of independent jobbers or an agreement to maintain monopolistic control over distribution or so on by fixing and controlling the price at which gasoline would be sold, if at all, to independent dealers and jobbers selling gasoline in the Southern California area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.934" offset="7467133">The District Court, when it decided this case, pointed out, in line with the particularization of the issues that had arisen in the course of pretrial, that this was a case in which the charge was that the major oil companies and Olympic Oil Company, named in this -- in the plaintiffs' complaint, had conspired to eliminate this type of marketer from the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.668" offset="7598059">The statements by counsel in the course of the pretrial proceedings were so limit the issues that are set out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.083" offset="7635675">Now, in comparison to that complaint, and I may say that I feel that for the purposes of this case which we consider to be one which is-- which should be summarily disposed of, for the purposes of this case, we should apply the broadest test that the Court would possibly apply under Section 5 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.182" offset="7740061">If we turn to the -- the allegation of the Government's complaint in the west coast case and, thereafter, a recital of the description of the industry in the west coast, the complaint at page 57 of the appendix, under the heading “Control of the Industry,” points out or alleges, which was never proved of course, that the oil industry in the Pacific States area is controlled and dominated completely by the defendant majors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.340" offset="7896691">Now, that suit was brought against all seven of the major oil companies operating on the west coast and the Conservation Committee of California Oil Producers which was alleged to have been a tool of the major oil companies in limiting production in aid of their monopolization of the west coast industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.377" offset="7976835">It was a typical American Tobacco case, an allegation that, in an oligopolistic market, there had been a concert of action among the companies, the major oil companies that dominated the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.059" offset="8039633">And, in paragraph 65, after reviewing the industry, the Government alleged that these seven major oil companies controlled 94% of the crude oil produced, that after transportation level, they controlled approximately 97% of all crude oil trunk lines and 70% of gathering lines, that at the refining level, they controlled 85%, that at the marketing level, they controlled 86%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.148" offset="8151960">And then, with this allegation of the power -- the joint power of the -- alleged joint power of these companies, the complaint alleged in paragraph 69 in the general language of the Sherman Act that beginning in or about the year 1936 and continuing up to and including 1950 when the complaint was filed, the defendants engaged in a combination of conspiracy unreasonably to restrain and to monopolize and had monopolized trade and commerce in the production, transportation, refining, and marketing of crude oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.187" offset="8300126">And then, specifically, in paragraph 70, come the matters complained of by the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.065" offset="8339623">The aforesaid combination of conspiracy and the monopolization have consisted of a continuing agreement and concert of action among the defendants, the substantial terms of which have been that the defendants (a) agree to eliminate competition among themselves in the Pacific States area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.464" offset="8429275">And, may I ask the Court to just turn the page to 61 to the (b) allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.322" offset="8452681">First, they agree to eliminate competition among themselves in the Pacific States area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.284" offset="8468459">Secondly, and (b), they agree to utilize their control of the production, transportation, refining, and marketing of crude oil and refined petroleum products to restrict and to eliminate the competition of independent producers, refiners, and marketers in the Pacific States area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.812" offset="8538572">Now, under each of those subdivisions of the alleged conspiracy are the terms of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.838" offset="8562709">They are set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.361" offset="8572844">And the agreement to eliminate competition among themselves in the Pacific ar -- States area was by stabilizing the amount of crude oil to be produced, by fixing and maintaining uniform and noncompetitive prices to be paid for crude oil, I'm reading the numbered paragraphs on page 59, by pulling their respective crude oil transportation facilities for the reciprocal use of each of them, and then come the allegations with respect to marketing at the top of page 60, by sharing wholesale and retail markets with each other in the sale of gasoline and other refined petroleum products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.393" offset="8716936">And, let me read here more particularly, (a) by standardizing the various grades, qualities, and structure of gasoline and other refined petroleum products in such manner as to make such products really interchangeable among themselves, (b) by making exchange agreements among themselves which permit each defendant major to penetrate markets not otherwise available, (c) by selling gasoline and other refined petroleum products at identical prices, thus, confining effective competition among themselves to the advertising of brand names and the offering of free services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.584" offset="8853713">Then, (6) by fixing and maintaining uniform and noncompetitive prices for the sale of gasoline and other refined petroleum products at wholesale by causing one to post prices and all the other to follow those posted prices, (7) by fixing and maintaining uniform and noncompetitive resale prices to be charged to consumers by retailers, resale price maintenance at the retail level, and (8) by maintaining the wholesale and retail prices agreed upon, first, by refusing to sell gasoline to those who would not sell at the prices fixed by the majors and (b) by adopting a uniform policy of exclusive dealing contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.769" offset="9014418">Now, those are the only allegations in the complaint relating to marketing except that under (b), which is the only allegation in the Government's complaint which relates to the exclusion of marketers in the Pacific States area, there is, in the last paragraph of (b) on page 64, an allegation that the major oil companies agreed to foreclose independent wholesale and retail markets otherwise available to independent refiners by requiring independent jobbers, wholesalers, and retailers to handle exclusively the refined petroleum products of defendant majors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.270" offset="9176482">All of the other allegations of (b) relate to the production of crude oil, Conservation Committee, and to the alleged activities of the major oil companies in seeking to eliminate independent refiners on the Pacific Coast area.</text>

            <text syncTime="2464.611" offset="9961827">In the opinion of the District Court, both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals referred to the strict rule of the Steiner case, and perhaps we should mention that a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.161" offset="10011982">Ten years ago, in the Ninth Circuit, the Court of Appeals decided the case -- the Steiner case and there, the Court held in a case that involved the question as to whether there should be a tolling under 5 (b), there, the Court held that in order to be a tolling there must be a greater similarity, and I'm quoting from page 8 of our brief, the small brief, “there must be a greater similarity then than the same conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.929" offset="10123055">The same means must be used to achieve the same objectives of the same conspiracies by the same defendants,” in other words, the same overt acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.170" offset="10172061">After that decision in the Steiner case, the Tenth Court -- Circuit Court in the Nisley case, Union Carbide against Nisley, expressly disagreeing with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, said that 5 (b) should not be given such a narrow construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.986" offset="10239352">I should say that, in reaching this decision, the Ninth Circuit applied the reasoning that 5 (b) should be given the same interpretation as 5 (a) with its quasi res adjudicata features.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.796" offset="10290552">It followed Judge Wyzanski's opinion and the Momand case in doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.694" offset="10306121">In the Nisley case, the Tenth Circuit said that as of this Court did at the last term in the Minnesota Mining case, that that was too rigid a test to place upon 5 (b), that 5 (b) should be given a broader application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.922" offset="10359097">In the Goldwyn case, which came up later then in the Ninth Circuit, after Nisley had disapproved and disagreed with the Steiner case, the Ninth Circuit held in that case that the statute had been tolled, in a motion picture case, even though the conspiracy that was alleged by the Government in the government case had not alleged that it was directed against the class of persons to whom the petitioner belonged in the Goldwyn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.564" offset="10465677">They adopted a more liberal construction and said, as this Court said in Minnesota Mining, that the plaintiff's case need be based only in part and not entirely on the allegation -- the matters complained of in the Government case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.308" offset="10528580">Later, the -- this case was decided and answering your question, Mr. Justice Douglas, in the District Court is the principle point considered there, as it was in the Court of Appeals, was whether the three-year or one-year statute of limitations of California applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.586" offset="10605693">The plaintiff had relied upon the three-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.645" offset="10617919">It was in time that that was applicable and both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that the one-year, and not the three-year statute, was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.068" offset="10647594">Then the plaintiff was compelled to turn to -- to rely upon the tolling statute and it had principally relied, of course, upon the three-year statute before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.379" offset="10688867">And, toward the end of the District Court's opinion, the Court does consider the question as to whether or not the plaintiff's action is -- is barred or is not tolled by 5 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.396" offset="10736933">And there, the Court cites the strict test -- the District Court cites the strict test of the Steiner case and says that under that test, the statute was not tolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.768" offset="10774444">When the case got to the Court of Appeals, however, the Court of Appeals cited not only its original decision in Steiner but it cited the decision in Nisley, which was quoted and approved by this Court in the Minnesota Mining case last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.383" offset="10832854">The test in the Nisley case, as I take is really the test in the Minnesota Mining case, is whether there is a substantial identity of subject matter between the two complaints.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.428" offset="11305044">Our position is that the plaintiffs' complaint in this case is not based in part upon any matter complained of in the Government's complaint, and that, it appears to us, is -- is -- is manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.055" offset="11367633">Now, let me state as to the matters that Mr. Harris has mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.266" offset="11384456">In the first place, the question as to whether or not this conspiracy commenced in 1948 and the injury occurred in 1954 might be -- that is not -- we do not consider that that is determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.613" offset="11445791">When one complaint, the Government complaints -- complaint, alleges that a conspiracy commenced in or about 1936 among seven major oil companies and the conservation committee and when the plaintiffs' complaint comes along later and specifically says “my conspiracy commenced in 1948 among less than all of the defendants, six of the eight conspirators in the Government's case and one additional company,” then at least that is a flag, an indication, that there -- that there might be an entirely different cause of action alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.052" offset="11599600">And that is particularly so when the facts complained of, the conduct complained of, and the matter -- subject matter of the plaintiffs' complaint is a phenomenon in the oil industry, the self-served station, that came into existence 12 years after the complaint and the Government's case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.809" offset="11682565">But, we don't urge that as a determinative test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.929" offset="11691133">Obviously, if this complaint had said that the conspiracy existed in 1948 and hurt me later on, there -- and the Government's case had said the conspiracy was formed in 36 and continued until ‘50, there wouldn't be any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.284" offset="11760515">And if the plaintiff, instead of saying existed, said the plainti -- the conspiracy commenced in ‘48, whereas, the Government's commenced in ‘36, applying the substantial identity test, Mr. Justice Clark, I don't think the plaintiff would be thrown out of Court because he used the word “commenced” instead of “existed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.939" offset="11835120">So, the question is “are the conspiracies the same?</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.539" offset="11849540">Are the terms of the conspiracies the same?</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.293" offset="11860511">Are the overt acts alleged to have occurred the same in such substantial degree that it can be said that they -- that the plaintiffs' case is based in whole or in part upon any matter complained of by the Government?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.481" offset="11913279">So, I -- I say that the fact that there is a specific allegation that the con -- conspiracy commenced in 1948 and related to an event which had not even been in existence at the time the Government's case was brought is a significant factor to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.549" offset="11969599">Secondly, on the members of the conspiracy, now this, it seems to me, is a significant fact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.056" offset="11995617">The Government alleged that all seven oil companies in an oligopolistic market combine completely to monopolize the petroleum industry on the west coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.216" offset="12036263">The Government's complaint would not have been the same in any way at all if it had alleged, as the plaintiff does in this case, that not all of the major oil companies but only part of it had combined and conspired because the presence of all of those companies was essential to the conspiracy which the Government alleged, namely an overall monopolistic conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.127" offset="12127901">When the plaintiff comes along and alleges a conspiracy without the presence of the Shell Oil Company or the Conservation Committee, which was -- which was kernelled that core of the Government's case, and with the presence of an independent oil company as a separate conspiracy commenced at a different time, then you are very definitely, and it seems to me uncontrovertibly, stating a different conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.850" offset="12342732">Well, that -- that would be the ultimate test, Justice Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.250" offset="12356420">I think the first test that you apply in this case is “are the conspiracies the same in any way at all?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.017" offset="12387453">Now, the conspiracies are not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.759" offset="12398425">The Government's conspiracy is a conspiracy that all the major oil companies agreed among themselves to eliminate competition with each other and, as it is alleged in paragraph 74 of the complaint, to conduct their businesses as though they were under a single management and a single ownership in a complete monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.650" offset="12473971">Now, the plaintiffs' complaint later on did not include the Shell Oil Company, one of the major oil companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.636" offset="12497899">It included an independent oil company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.791" offset="12506572">It did not include the conservation committee and it did not allege a monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.535" offset="12525484">It alleged a conspiracy on the part of those different defendants to eliminate a particular type of marketer in the business, the rebrand independent jobber.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.366" offset="12572818">Now, if the test is “are the conspiracies the same?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.118" offset="12587865">and that is the test that was applied in the Nisley case and the Goldwyn case, as well as in the Steiner case, then obviously, they're not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.430" offset="12621093">But, coming to your point, Mr. Justice Clark, if we go one point beyond that, and we say that you look only to the -- you have to separate and look at every overt act or every term of the conspiracy, then if you read the term of the Government's complaint one by one through the 38 paragraphs, each one which is alleged to be a term of the conspiracy and by 71, the complaint has alleged that the major oil companies did the things which they are charged of having agreed to do so there the overt acts under the conspiracy, if you separate and treat each one of those as something complained of by the Government which, in fact, it wasn't but if you treat it as a separate conspiracy, still the plaintiffs' complaint doesn't read on any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.635" offset="12809906">Now, let me call your attention to those that refer to marketing because there are no others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.564" offset="12829654">They're obviously -- the other allegations concerning production, refining, and so on are not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.782" offset="12858493">If you turn to page 60 of the appendix and you look at the four allegations there that relate to marketing, paragraph 5 says that the defendants in that case agreed to eliminate competition among themselves, and let's forget the overall broad conspiracy part, and just say that the defendants agreed to share wholesale and retail markets with each other in the sale of gasoline and other refined petroleum products, how?</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.249" offset="12988374">(a) by standardizing the various grades, qualities, and structure of gasoline and other refined petroleum products in such manner as to make such products really interchangeable among themselves, (b) by making exchange agreements among themselves to prevent defendant majors to penetrate markets; (c) by selling gasoline and other refined petroleum products at identical prices, thus, confining competition among themselves to the advertising of brand names and the offering of free services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.328" offset="13096730">There is no allegation in the plaintiffs' complaint that reads on that in any way whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.217" offset="13120240">There's a primary price fixing and elimination of competition among the majors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.190" offset="13148139">If you turn to (6), by fixing and maintaining uniform and noncompetitive prices for the sale of gasoline and other refined petroleum products of wholesale by causing one of them to post to each of the wholesale distribution points an agreed price for each type of grade of gasoline and by causing each fee of the defendants to post and charges prices identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.955" offset="13231208">Here is an allegation of primary price fixing among the defendants on the products that they sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.106" offset="13255764">The plaintiff alleges only that we fix prices at which we would -- for the sale of product to a particular brand or type of distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.363" offset="13304874">If you turn over to his allegations on page 18 again, (b) -- take (b) agree to eliminate the customers of independent jobbers of refined gasoline by refusing to sell gasoline to independents, refusing to sell to the customers of independents, and fixing and controlling the price at which gasoline would be sold, if at all, to independent dealers and jobbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.819" offset="13398601">Now, an allegation of an overall stabilization of price at the primary level is entirely different from a conspiracy which alleges a discriminatory use of price at a particular level and with respect to a particular class to eliminate that class of marketer from the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.824" offset="13494627">Reading then in (7), by fixing and maintaining uniform and noncompetitive resale price to be charged to cus -- consumers by retailers, handling the gasoline and other refined petroleum products of defendant majors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.665" offset="13546036">Now there, again, there is no allegation in this complaint -- in the plaintiffs' complaint that the -- that the companies have fixed resale prices at the retail level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.670" offset="13590026">And then, finally, (8), and this is the one that Mr. Harris read to the Court, by maintaining the wholesale and retail prices agreed upon, how?</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.026" offset="13623463">By refusing to sell their gasoline and other refined petroleum products to any wholesale or retail distributor who fails or refuses to follow the prices fixed by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.675" offset="13666095">There is no allegation in the plaintiffs' complaint that there has been -- that there was a conspiracy that refused to sell to persons that would not maintain the price, resale price maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.287" offset="13712488">And, that's an entirely different conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.225" offset="13724296">So, we say that, upon examination of it, there's no issue of law between us, no conflict of decisions, and an examination of the two complaints leads to the conclusion that they are not -- that the plaintiffs' complaint is not based in part on any matter complained of in the Government's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.974" offset="13787303">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.751" offset="13830353">Number one, he points out that the complaint in the government case and the complaint in the private case were filed in the same district of the same court and, therefore, we had available to us the various materials that the Government had unearthed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.764" offset="13882389">Nothing could be farther from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.982" offset="13891271">Similarly, it is not so that discovery was completed in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.935" offset="13907153">In the government pleas, the files were very early sealed by court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.839" offset="13922722">In fact, in 1950 or 1951, I moved in 1958 or 1959, I don't know which, to unseal those files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.604" offset="13957831">The files have never, to this day, been unsealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.444" offset="13969115">That is still pending because, at that time, Judge Mathes suspended our case pending the outcome of the government case, the Texaco case being continued on, and then subsequently decided the statute of limitations issue so that this case should go back to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.911" offset="14039019">At that time, much discovery remains to be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.634" offset="14049886">The government files have never been unsealed in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.404" offset="14148942">I think that's a fair statement, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.753" offset="14158346">Now, the second point that was raised, the defendants or respondents place great reliance upon the fact that the government complaint charges that the defendants agreed among themselves, and they've even italicized this language at page 3 of their brief, as the Court has probably noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.275" offset="14220518">However, this argument is completely laid to rest by the Goldwyn case which they, themselves, cite at page 10 of their brief because Goldwyn, you'll recall, involved a government conspiracy alleging that the theatre people were attempting to conspire and did conspire and combined to achieve a monopolization of theatres that has retail distribution of films.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.109" offset="14319783">Goldwyn was an independent motion picture producer and it was argued all through the Goldwyn case that he was not, within a car-see language, within the target area of the conspiracy because he was an independent motion picture producer and the Government was talking about people that were conspiring to freeze distribution houses of motion pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.918" offset="14399091">And, the Court there didn't find any difficulty at all with that, even in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.801" offset="14414555">They said that even though the Government talked about this type of conspiracy, Goldwyn could still be hurt by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.139" offset="14447888">So, the fact that the government complaint alleges they conspired among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.611" offset="14461785">It, seems to me, isn't relevant here, insofar as we are claiming that we have been hurt by the same conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3664.833" offset="14762715">Still on this point as to whether the allegations between the complaints are the same, first, the charge about conspiring among themselves has to be considered in light of Goldwyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.009" offset="14807437">And then, the overt acts that Mr. Kirkham referred to at page 18 of his appendix of course alleges -- at page 18, he's referring to matters where we have set forth the terms and conditions of the conspiracy alleged at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.958" offset="14867205">However -- and these, we submit, are quite relevant and are based on, at least in part, the government case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.697" offset="14894164">However, when you get over to the overt acts which we allege, which of course are the things most often referred to in the decisions, at page 21 of the appendix, paragraph 22, the overt acts are practically parallel with the charge of the government complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.002" offset="14963336">And it was from the overt acts that I quoted at the start of my argument, and I won't re-quote them but, considering page 21, I don't think we have any question that we're talking about, in the language again of the Minnesota Mining case the matters complained of by the government in its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.990" offset="15031359">And then, finally, there can be no question that the Ninth Circuit relied upon Steiner from simply considering the opinion which is part of the petition for certiorari, of course.</text>
