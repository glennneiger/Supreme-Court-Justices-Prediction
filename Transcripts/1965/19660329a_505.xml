            <text syncTime="43.326" offset="276668">I think that in order to get the issues in this case clear I would, if the Court will, I like to give the background facts in this case first.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.431" offset="333093">This case arose when the respondent who is the owner of a tropical market grocery and meat store in the Negro neighborhood in Savannah, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.819" offset="390666">An employee of his, which was about a 15-year-old Negro boy, indicated to his mother that he had been hit by the proprietor of this store.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.447" offset="449181">A warrant was taken out for the respondent and he was interrogated and investigated by officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.879" offset="486902">The mother indicated that after she had made the complaint to the police that she received some threatening telephone calls as a the result that she got in touch with the local N.A.A.C.P. which was in Savannah.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.258" offset="548446">They had a meeting and had a circular out in which they indicated people to come to hear about this brutality by this man as a result of the meeting in which one of the defendants below, Mr. Law was the president of the local branch and a Reverend Jordan who was the vice president, attended.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.415" offset="644995">The branch decided that they would have picket around the store of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.643" offset="677909">The testimony on the part of Law is that they put two on each corner around this -- around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.323" offset="704658">They were instructed to be peaceful and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.838" offset="722735">As a result of this picketing which began on June 1 and lasted until an injunction was issued on June 22, this was suit for damage was brought against the local N.A.A.C.P. against the State N.A.A.C.P. against the two individuals and against a New York Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.643" offset="809984">The -- a word of damages by the jury on the basis of the facts was a $35 judgment -- $35,000 judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.878" offset="846869">The ordinary damages against the -- all of the defendants and a $50,000 judgment of punitive damages are against all of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.125" offset="887829">An appeal was taken through the Supreme Court of Georgia and it was affirmed as to all but the Georgia State Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.311" offset="920639">We brought the case here alleging the -- there was a violation of various rights of peaceful picketing and this Court granted certiorari and regrettably limited certiorari to the validity of the judgment as against the New York Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.083" offset="999737">That is the issue which is before the Court at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.414" offset="1016978">That is whether the judgment of $85,000 which the New York Corporation is liable is valid and is attainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.134" offset="1055953">We think that the question on that if the Court pleases is not closed.</text>
