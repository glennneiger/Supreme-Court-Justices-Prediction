            <label>Mr. Leon Hubert, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="6.859" offset="130800">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.062" offset="151594">At the close of yesterday's session I -- I was in the course of pointing out that in my view of the matter, if the property involved in this case were furniture or TV set, we would not be here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.142" offset="203943">The case would be controlled by Dameron versus Brodhead decided in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.601" offset="233827">But in this case, Mississippi claims that because the property is a house trailer that Section 2 (b) of Section 574 which appears -- the text which appears at page 34 of our brief is applicable to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.790" offset="306552">Now that means in our view, that Mississippi claims that the house trailer is a motor vehicle because the proviso applies only to motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.767" offset="346467">It also means that Mississippi takes the view, that unless there's compliance with the proviso then the entire immunity of Section 574 is lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.067" offset="399653">That is to say that unless you register and pay licenses with your home state, you not only loose the immunity from the licenses and registration in your – in the host state but you loose also the immunity from ad valorem taxes in the host state.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.199" offset="484185">Now, it is semantically possible, I suppose, that the Act can be read that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.796" offset="514591">The Solicitor General in his brief takes the position that the Proviso Clause applies only to 2 (b) and therefore, he said that it's restriction only in the sense that if you do not pay licenses and so forth in your home state, that's all that you loose with respect to the host state.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.081" offset="607692">It is possible that the Act could be read that the way Mississippi reads it, we think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.324" offset="636635">Now, why don't we think so, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.207" offset="656175">In the first place because every time Congress has an opportunity to deal with the immunity to be given to servicemen, it has used a liberal approach towards the servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.810" offset="710614">For example, the original 1940 Act provided no immunity whatsoever with reference to the income of servicemen in another state when they were there on the military orders nor does it provide specifically for any protection against taxation of the movable property of servicemen in the host state.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.195" offset="804133">But in 1942, apparent to that problem was giving some difficulty and so Congress stepped into the breach and said that, it's [Inaudible] Mr. Dameron would not lose his immunity because of change, but the approach taken was that he would not loose his domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.250" offset="888351">That his domicile would remain the same and it was hoped that in that way they would avoid the state taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.114" offset="919803">Now, the 1944 Act when there was still some doubt about the question illustrates again the congressional intent to add liberality towards the servicemen because there they used the situs Test.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.290" offset="972570">They said that the mere fact that a man happens to be in another state, the host state, under military orders will not change the situs of his property for taxation purposes to the new state and therefore, of course, the situs would remain in the old state.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.333" offset="1036727">The only other example of Congressional intent that we have is the Congressional Action of 1962 when there arose a question as to where the situs problem that might be when the serviceman was not in any particular state as it happened and there was a case pending in a lower courts and Congress took the view that only the home state would have any situs with respect to the taxation of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.359" offset="1152815">Now this Court also, if we are going to look for the intent of Congress which I suggest is what we're doing here since impossibly is ambiguity from the standpoint of semantics, when you look at the intent of Congress, Congress always has taken the liberal view, but so has this Court, in fact, in interpreting the rights of servicemen under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.070" offset="1247692">First example of that was in the Leves versus Leparoux in which there was a question as to whether or not a Florida statute to would cut off a serviceman's right to redeem his property which had been sold for taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.522" offset="1309445">It so happened that before the period of grace had run out, he was inducted in the service and of course after he was in the service of two, three months left of the good period of grace ran out.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.485" offset="1353331">But when he --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="312.654" offset="1353958">Mr. Hubert, is this -- the issue here is simple as -- does the statutory meaning of license for your excise, is that all we have before us?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leon_hubert_jr" startTime="321.879" stopTime="328.666">
            <label>Mr. Leon Hubert, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="321.879" offset="1390843">Well, I think so Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.813" offset="1398575">It's also – it goes to what Congress intended to do.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="328.666" stopTime="329.927">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="328.666" offset="1418010">What -- by those words?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leon_hubert_jr" startTime="329.927" stopTime="454.358">
            <label>Mr. Leon Hubert, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="329.927" offset="1423130">By those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.379" offset="1428877">It seems to me that what it is sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.720" offset="1438281">But in the -- turning back to the Leparoux case this Court said that it would interpret the statute with friendly eye to those who would have given up their homes and so forth to go into the service and therefore, applied and just tolled the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.044" offset="1495542">Thus, the [Inaudible] the Florida statute in that case cert to permit relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.417" offset="1512991">Now in Dameron versus Brodhead which is a leading case in this field, although, it does not involve an automobile, it was urged upon this Court that the purpose of the statute was to prevent double taxation and that therefore unless double taxation appeared to be a fact in anyone of the cases that the immunity would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.994" offset="1591359">This Court rejected that contention and said that no that Congress had chosen the broader technique of just simply saying the soldiers' domicile had not changed or the situs of his property had not changed by the reason of enforced movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.833" offset="1658755">I think they said that because obviously, it would be harder to administrate -- administer a statute when a soldier might move several times in the course year and the best way to do it was to say that only at the one place, but it was a liberal interpretation in favor of the servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.716" offset="1730226">Now, furthermore of course if Congress had intended really to say as Mississippi contends that unless you pay the licenses, fees and excises.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.101" offset="1775783">Now, you lose also ad valorem protection or rather protection from ad valorem taxes, it seems to me that the proviso could have read precisely that way and instead of reading as it does, it would have read this way, “Provided all licenses fees, excises, and ad valorem taxes had been paid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="438.694" offset="1858121">Now, there's no question about it and Mississippi concedes, the Attorney General does and the Supreme Court does in Mississippi, that what we have involved in this case is an ad valorem tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.432" offset="1897096">It is true and it is taxed on to as commission precedent to getting a license.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.358" offset="1920815">Well, do you argue Mr. Hubert that the ad valorem tax is what excluded from those, is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="491.411" offset="2068982">Because we have another point in this case and if the -- in this case, we're involved here with house trip which Mississippi says with a motor vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.514" offset="2249435">So they said you must pay at your home State or if your not done so then you must pay at your host state, but what pay what, only registration and license fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.508" offset="2461445">But this was not in the tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.013" offset="2467401">As a matter of fact, the house trailer Ad Valorem Tax Act which what we are dealing with came into affect on November 1, 1962 and this proceeding begun immediately thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.193" offset="2520168">Now as I pointed out, all of the above is only assumption that the house trailer isn't motor vehicle within Section 2 of the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.360" offset="2568861">We do not actually concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.061" offset="2583594">Mississippi analyzes several federal statutes because there's no definition of motor vehicle in this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.673" offset="2614105">It attempts to find that in other federal statutes the term motor vehicle is define as including a trailer in which to point out I've done so in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.898" offset="2654960">I will not deliberate here that the federal statutes involved, all contemplates, it seems to me a movement along the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.798" offset="2686516">It is true that the definition is broad enough to cover our trailers, but all these trailers attached to power units.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.879" offset="2722879">Now with every federal statute that's been cited deals with trailers in the sense that there are moving, that's particularly true for example of Dyer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.391" offset="2764988">I don't think that if a trailer would move by manpower, physical strength and not by a power unit that it would be within Dyer Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.813" offset="2802604">So my point is that those statutes from which Mississippi attempts to keep a meaning that trailers are included within the term “motor vehicle” I do not think aid them at all on those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.477" offset="2857253">Now turning to the general case law and we've analyzed it in our brief also, and I will not labor the cases individually here, we find that while the term motor vehicle is broader than the term automobile which literally it means “mobile by its own power” nevertheless, it's pretty clear in insurance cases and the criminal cases and then other types of cases, that a trailer standing alone is never regarded as a motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.436" offset="2977102">It may well be if it's attached to power unit, but standing alone and immobile, it is never so far as I know that --</text>

            <text syncTime="767.289" offset="3172498">Now further up, let me make one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.450" offset="3185142">Mississippi itself initiated this action and characterized the whole proceeding as a house trailer proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.968" offset="3211264">If Mississippi did not have a motor vehicle statute that would be understandable but it does and that statute has interpreted by its own Attorney General has been held to mean that as to a motor vehicle, Mississippi recognizes the situs theory of the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.241" offset="3284302">Now then, why did Mississippi pass a new Act dealing with house trailers, segregating them away from motor vehicles and then providing that they shall be taxed ad valorem because it's a prerequisite to obtaining the license and omit the provision which it has in his Motor Vehicle Act that they shall be exempt?</text>
            <text syncTime="814.609" offset="3361834">I suggest that it was done solely for the purpose of taxation ad valorem wise which could not be done under the existing Motor Vehicle Act of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.263" offset="3408436">Now, I want to reserve a few moments for rebuttal so I make one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.866" offset="3422856">Mississippi Supreme Court based its opinion large in this case upon the theory that Section 574 is based upon the idea of double taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.972" offset="3599235">I feel very much likely just we laid – it was in a lawyer's office trying to settle the affairs of her deceased husband who is a successful businessman who have wide and extensive business interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.230" offset="3644270">And after she had listened to her meticulous lawyer explain all of things that she would have to do for several hours as she finally sit back in a chair inside if I had known its going to be this much trouble, I just would rather he wouldn't have died.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.458" offset="3713233">So that we had any idea that it was going to be this much trouble and it probably would have given them $2 to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.664" offset="3742072">But we all know, no one knows better than this Court that principles of taxation and State Government, taxation being the very life blood of State Government, cannot be surrendered for the personal convenience of those people who happen to be charged with administering, so that at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.627" offset="3829844">This Court held as long ago as McCulloch versus Maryland that a state had a right to tax everything within its boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.284" offset="3884492">It very recently not too recently but recently cited that that case Gray versus Medler where it even held at New York had the right to tax intangibles found in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.390" offset="3936946">And of course as this Court well knows that's held on many different occasions that exemptions and exceptions from taxation are the exception and not the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.218" offset="4020224">Well, I say this that two members of this present court saw a constitutional question when they dissented from the original opinion in Dameron versus Brodhead case.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.771" offset="4058467">But I see a basic, we're not questioning the right of Congress because the majority of the Court in that case held at Congress had that right, but, we are saying that in the absence if that Federal Act if this Court is not called upon to construe Section 514, the second paragraph, the second numbered paragraph, if this Court is not called on to construe it, if it does not grant absolute immunity from taxation, the tax imposed in the case by Mississippi is a valid exercise of sovereignty to that extent we say its constitutional issue Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.619" offset="4209873">Now in Dameron versus Brodhead, we think the significant language insofar as this particular case is concerned is found on page 325 of the official report where the court said, “Congress had that valid right because of the military assignment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.907" offset="4311019">The Court said, “What has been said in no way affects the reserved powers of the states to tax for the statute merely states that the taxable domicile of serviceman shall not be changed by a military assignment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.203" offset="4388133">That the majority thought that Congress had the right to do and we are not here questioning that opinion, although, we point out that it was a close question at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.437" offset="4441109">Now, we assume that the Court has looked at by now, it's repeated several times, it's in my original opinion to the state auditor, its in the Supreme Court opinion in abbreviated form, it's in Exhibit A to both the government's amicus curiae brief and Exhibit A to the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.855" offset="4554794">The statute in question and it says for the purposes of taxation, “The soldier may leave home and take his property within but his property never leaves home.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.318" offset="4600665">Now, the court below held that that was a legal fiction and in all cases by virtue of Dameron versus Brodhead in all cases, it would apply except motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.404" offset="4672972">Now the Congress, I'm getting into the legislative history, although the Government says, there is no legislative history, we have a found some, the Congress added a second Section to 514 of the Soldier's and Sailor's Civil Relief Act and that second section provided that the first section would apply to personal property, including motor vehicles and it would include licenses, fees, and excise paid on those motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.044" offset="4831587">The words are these, “it shall include but not be limited to.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.723" offset="4850291">Now, the Supreme Court of Mississippi held that the inclusion of the two grand fields of taxation that is licenses and excises and that the words not be limited to proceeding that necessarily included ad valorem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.055" offset="4915597">And this Court so held in Dameron versus Brodhead and said, “ad valorem was excluded.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.871" offset="4938898">Now, the point we are making is that provided the license, fee or excise required by the laws of the home State have been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.825" offset="4994696">Now, we get into the matter of where the registered or unregistered automobiles would be permitted to go up and down highways and streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.119" offset="5027819">Now in addition, one more in legislative history if the Court please, the Congress was considering as it shown by Exhibit H to the petitioner's brief a statute that would have granted absolute immunity from taxation of all sorts to servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.951" offset="5131160">Now that Act was submitted by the Chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs to the Judge Advocate General's Department of the War Department and as the Secretary of War was asked, I mean, they asked for advice and recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.094" offset="5207751">Now, those -- that advice and recommendations came back in the form of a substitute Bill which they recommended passed or be passed and Congress without changing a word or a punctuation marked passed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.176" offset="5284028">So that's the law we're dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.610" offset="5293850">Not the one that would have granted absolute immunity from taxation, but the one that the War Department drafted for the Congress and it had this proviso in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.934" offset="5347140">Now, the U. S. Justice Department there are some reasoning that eludes me, could try to construe that proviso as being limited to – don't even -- trying to limit it beyond its own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.158" offset="5400012">But this Court has held in numerous occasions that proviso -- a proviso in a statute limits the affect of the enactment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.235" offset="5468348">We treat with that on page 8 of our brief and the Court held that the illogical and grammatical scope of a proviso applied to the Principle Clause, that is in this case Section 1, numbered 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.251" offset="5532400">In other words, Section 2 includes by its terms and applies to motor vehicles provided the license, fee or excise required by the laws of the home state of the serviceman have been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.257" offset="5604394">Now, our view of this particular matter is not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.356" offset="5628844">Mississippi's view of it is not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.590" offset="5637726">In fact, in my recent opinion I relied very heavily on the Supreme Court decision of the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.477" offset="5665311">That decision you see Portsmouth had levied a license fee for this support of the City Government of Portsmouth and the serviceman attempted through the application of Section 514 of the Soldier's and Sailor's Civil Relief Act to avoid the payment of that $10 license fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.636" offset="5789968">The Supreme Court of Virginia said that, Section 2 since he was registered, his automobile was registered in the State of Virginia, he was subject to that license, that $10 license that was applied by the City of Portsmouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.438" offset="5849109">Now, it's been stated here that Congress amended the Act several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.500" offset="5885367">This particular Act has been amended, it was amended in 1940 and that was the amendment the legislative history that I just discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.870" offset="5914833">It was amended again in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.024" offset="5931447">Now, this Whitehead case was decided in 1961 by the highest appellate court of Virginia and the Congress, certainly the military with full knowledge of that reported opinion asked the Congress to amend Section 1 to relieve a serviceman domiciled in New Jersey from having to pay taxes because he was overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.943" offset="6027160">He had left his duty State and left his family in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.189" offset="6044087">The District Court held at the taxes were due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.024" offset="6055476">The Court of Appeals in reviewing that case observed that Congress amended Section 1 of the Act to clarify its original intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.593" offset="6117752">Now, my point there is certainly the Supreme Court of Virginia's interpretation of that statute couldn't be binding on this Court, but we submit that it's persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.946" offset="6151189">There is a Court that has delivered and looked in to this proviso and held that the serviceman had a right and he has an absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.314" offset="6200613">He has a right that the members of this Court don't him have and that is to register the automobiles back in their home State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.436" offset="6241155">And our position is that that right is given him by a Congress and he can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.155" offset="6268008">And no matter where he goes in the service of this country his home state license is valid and he can successful defend a prosecution for improper driver's licenses or anything else based on Section 514 of the Soldier's and Sailor's Civil Relief Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.946" offset="6343137">Our further position is that unless he himself does that, voluntarily registers in his home State, he subjects himself to the registration licensing and taxing laws of the State where he is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.192" offset="6412100">And we think that's a reasonable construction to be placed on this Federal statute and we think it is a proper construction to be placed on this federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.640" offset="6449925">We think the federal statute certainly is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.322" offset="6460688">If it grants -- if this Court holds that it grants absolute immunity, then we're through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.603" offset="6477824">We don't even have to consider it further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.310" offset="6492662">But we submit that it does not grant absolute immunity insofar as motor vehicles are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.457" offset="6541249">We admit that has been illustrated on a Paean or any other item of household goods, it does as interpreted by Dameron versus Brodhead grants an exception from ad valorem taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.049" offset="6607600">Now, we think that the Court's interpretation of Section 514 will be dispositive of the matter, but we do for the Court's assistance we hope, we want to discuss some Mississippi statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.813" offset="6678653">They are both set forth both of the pertinent statutes are set forth as appendix to our brief and they been referred to or eluded to in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.628" offset="6749915">The Mississippi statutes are material to this case and the Court's determination of this case were two points and two points only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.748" offset="6786382">Alternative one, Mississippi made a good faith effort to induce this man to register his auto – his house trailer in Mississippi and that he failed and refused to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.607" offset="6929847">It involves a fee varying from over a few dollars up to possibly well on trucks and other things it's quite expensive but on personal motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.603" offset="6961821">In this particular case, that trailer could have been registered in Mississippi for $10 and if it had been registered in Mississippi by the payment of the fee of $10 under the first Mississippi statute that I'm going to discuss, there would have been exempt from that ad valorem tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.737" offset="7042278">Now, there the serviceman had not -- by that I mean this, in Mississippi in 1958 the Constitution was amended in 1956 to authorize a special mode of assessment and levy ad valorem taxes on motor vehicles.</text>
