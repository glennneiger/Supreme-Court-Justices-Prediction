            <text syncTime="41.684" offset="270085">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.692" offset="286177">One of the most remarkable developments in retail merchandising since the end of World War II has been the development of the discount house.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.092" offset="327764">Today, throughout the country, there exist a larger number of very good and large establishments which are devoted to selling consumer goods primarily as an -- with an emphasis on discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.579" offset="389726">The tremendous variety of consumer goods almost every type of thing we can think of with one striking exception and that has been new automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.659" offset="425984">What this case is about is the legality under Section 1 of the Sherman Act of certain actions taken by General Motors and its automobile dealers in order to stop the sale of new Chevrolet automobiles in the Los Angeles area through discount houses in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.576" offset="513651">The Government's complaint in this case filed in the Southern District of California named as the defendants General Motors and three, the associations of automobile dealers in the Los Angeles area.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.535" offset="569553">The individual dealers in that area were named as co-conspirators but not as defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.475" offset="601318">The charge made by the Government was that they had combined and conspired to induce and persuade Chevrolet dealers in that area to refrain from selling Chevrolets through discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.209" offset="660250">After a trial, the District Court held in favor of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.501" offset="677386">The court ruled there had not been any combination or conspiracy and that everything done by General Motors was a valid attempt to enforce a provision of its franchise agreement which I will come to in a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.863" offset="838823">The real issue is to what inferences ought to be gone from those facts and what can -- legal conclusions prior.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.240" offset="884381">We are Mr. Justice in few instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.816" offset="894621">There are few facts which on one of our theories we would have to overturn and I will come to those a little later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.349" offset="920743">We're not making a general attack on the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.580" offset="933700">We are of course challenging the legal conclusions of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.126" offset="951881">The way in which these new car discount sales took place is as follows, there were these large discount department stores in the Los Angeles area and within these discount department stores, independent people operated new car departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.948" offset="1023143">These departments generally occupied a small portion of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.825" offset="1038712">They had available new car literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.454" offset="1049161">They had in some instances new car models on display.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.269" offset="1064417">At no point at any time was there any ads in these sections for particular dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.270" offset="1088449">There was no advertisement of Adams Chevrolet or Brown Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.597" offset="1105795">That was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.339" offset="1112691">The discount department handled all makes and models of automobiles, not just Chevrolet, not just General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.387" offset="1144874">Now, there were two different techniques by which these sales make.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.815" offset="1162637">In the first type of technique which might be called the discount house sale itself, the costumer came in and told what particular car he wanted and the discount house then quoted a price to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.282" offset="1216449">They did not at that point tell him to which dealer the car would be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.929" offset="1231078">They quoted a price when they finally ended into a contract, at that point for the first time the costumer said your car will be supplied for example by Brutus Chevrolet, one of the dealers operating through a discount house.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.776" offset="1282487">The car ordinarily was delivered to the costumer at the discount house.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.987" offset="1303280">The discount house made the car available -- I'm sorry, the discount house got the car from the dealer with whom it had this arrangement and in turn, turned it over to the costumer.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.166" offset="1788008">The discount house would pay for the car at the time the discount house received it from the dealer, and the arrangement was ordinarily that the dealer would sell to the discount house at a certain stipulated mark-up over the dealer's invoice.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.899" offset="2046934">But in terms of the relationships between the dealer and the discount house and the costumer, as far as the dealer was concerned, the dealer turned title over to the costumer and in turn received the payment from the discount house.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.299" offset="2128541">And it's further may -- a little more confusing perhaps by the fact there was another method by which they did business which is perhaps a majority of the situation, and that was the so-called referral situation in which what happened was if a costumer came into the discount house and said he wanted to buy a particular model of a car, they said, “Fine!</text>
            <text syncTime="524.680" offset="2202102">We will refer you to a dealer who will sell it to you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="527.572" offset="2213700">In that situation, the costumer was not quoted a price at all, he was just referred to a particular dealer, and then he went to the dealer and directly negotiated a sale with the dealer in the same way that any other costumer would.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.602" offset="2273782">And the compensation in that arrangement was the dealer paid -- I'm sorry, the dealer -- it's correct, the dealer paid to the discount house a flat fee for each car that was sold under a referral.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.822" offset="2362702">In other words, the dealer said to the discount house for example, “We'll sell you the car for $75 over our invoice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="572.362" offset="2392795">So that the discount house's cost was the dealer's cost, invoice cost, plus $75 and then the discount house --</text>

            <text syncTime="709.888" offset="2942934">Do you place any significance to the fact that the title doesn't pass to discount houses?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="716.113" stopTime="1417.992">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="716.113" offset="2967803">Well, we think Mr. Justice that there is this significance and now from our point of view that General Motors apparently concedes that it would be permissible for the dealer to sell to a discount house.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.334" offset="3032691">In other words, they apparently concede that if the transaction took the form of the dealer selling to the discount house and the discount house then immediately turning it over to the costumer, they think they concede that would be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.815" offset="3086608">They say that for a fact that it sold through the discount house.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.532" offset="3101550">The title does not directly pass to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.288" offset="3112521">They think that makes the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.553" offset="3117537">And we -- as I shall develop later in my argument, we think that in terms of the basic defense that's offered of the need to preserve the franchise system in terms of the impact on competition, there's no distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.662" offset="3166020">So this is why we don't draw any distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.499" offset="3173334">I was just trying to explain the mechanics.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.342" offset="3188694">And for the sake of simplicity in my argument, I'm going to refer to both of these types of transaction as discount houses rather than separating them out, because we think in terms of the basic issues in the case as this, we don't draw any distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.628" offset="3245850">Now, the sales of automobiles through discount houses began apparently around 1957, but they didn't attain any substantial proportions until the middle of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.616" offset="3301857">In that year, 2% of all the Chevrolets sold in Los Angeles, that is approximately 2000 out of a total of 100,000 were sold through these discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.397" offset="3352952">And one significant area which we have focused on because that's most of the evidence relates to is an area called Orange County which was a substantial difference from downtown metropolitan Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.264" offset="3408436">And the dealers who were selling in Orange County were not the dealers located in Orange County but dealers located a substantial distance away, sometimes as much as 15 or 20 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.230" offset="3464338">Now, in the summer of 1960, a number of dealers who were members of one of the three defendant associations, the so-called Losor Association, became quite concerned about this discount selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.115" offset="3523793">And in a meeting of the association in June, they appointed a committee to call upon the Los Angeles regional zone manager, a Mr. O'Connor who was in charge with Chevrolet operations in that area in an attempt to induce General Motors as the District Court found in finding 34 to take some action respecting such selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.703" offset="3618147">They met with Mr. O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.453" offset="3625148">Mr. O'Connor agreed to do what he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.384" offset="3632880">He said he would talk to the dealers about it but he pointed out to them that his authority was rather limited, because as of that time, General Motors had not made any definitive announcement of its policy on discount selling and that every dealer was free to sell to whom he pleased.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.383" offset="3700903">Mr. O'Connor met with these dealers and the dealers did not indicate that they would stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.190" offset="3728175">So the Losor dealers decided that some stronger measures were important, and at a membership meeting in November of 1960 and the District Court found they agreed at that meeting to write letters or telegrams to the top management at General Motors urging General Motors to do something about this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.234" offset="3812289">The result of this was a flood of letters and telegrams to Detroit, total about 200 of them was sent by various salesmen primarily and also some of the dealers in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.681" offset="3858056">Now, I think it's significant because the District Court made a finding that in some instances, some of the complainants referred to price.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.816" offset="3894627">To point out that this printed record before the Court contains 36 documents in which specific complaint is made by the sellers and the dealers about the price cutting of the discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.799" offset="3954604">And several of these salesmen and dealers specifically complained about losing particular sale of cars to the discounting dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.060" offset="3991594">Now, I'd like to just read to the Court a few of some of these comments because I think they, better than anything else, give the flavor of what these complaining dealers in Orange County were concerned about, some of these typical comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.667" offset="4042062">For example, “Our Chevrolets are being discounted beyond reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.300" offset="4060557">Cars are being sold at tremendous discounts and to compete, we have to give all the gross profit away.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.673" offset="4086053">Discount houses are selling at fabulous discount prices, at huge discounts just over cost, and these discount houses are undercutting your legitimate dealers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.596" offset="4125759">Another salesman said, “It is impossible to compete with these people on a price basis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.748" offset="4146343">Another one said, “Their only advantage is cheap price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.169" offset="4160031">And one dealer made the following statement in a letter to General Motors, a dealer named Hopper, he said and this is at page 635 of the record, “These leeches are selling new Chevrolets 2 to $300 less than I can afford to deliver one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.766" offset="4222412">They informed the people to shop the agencies and get the best price as you can then come back and save hundreds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.797" offset="4250520">What hurts is that it is true.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.050" offset="4263581">Now when General Motors received these communications it took a number of steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.383" offset="4288867">The first step it took was to call upon the Los Angeles zone headquarters for a complete report on the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.290" offset="4320528">Including a statement as explained by Mr. O'Connor, “What action we in the zone we're taking to curb such sales.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.569" offset="4357622">And Mr. O'Connor responded that they had discussed the matter with all of the dealers in an attempt to get them to stop the practice and that indeed the dealer associations have formed a committee to call on the dealers to try to get them to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.038" offset="4415509">And then he continued, and this is at 651 of the record, “The people of the Los Angeles zone believed that many of the dealers will cease this type of business if they had any assurance that the account would not be picked up by some other dealer immediately upon relinquishment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.717" offset="4490219">In other words, what the dealers seem to be concerned about was that if some of them gave up selling these cars through discount houses, other dealers who haven't been doing would pick up the same business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.611" offset="4533791">When General Motors received this report, it conducted its own investigation, conducted extensive study of the matter and then formulated a company policy and sent out a letter to every General Motors dealer in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.562" offset="4601605">The president of General Motors testified in this case that if it hadn't been for the complaints from the dealers in Los Angeles, General Motors would have not promulgated this policy whether at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.103" offset="4659806">And just about his time, an internal memorandum was written within the General Motors organization which I think shows very clearly one of the things that General Motors was concerned of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.361" offset="4712782">It's only admittedly one sentence in a two or three-page memorandum, but it shows to me General Motors' recognition of what the problem was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.506" offset="4745383">This is the statement, the bottom of page 736 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.433" offset="4761057">This is a letter signed by a Mr. Gilead who was a high official in General Motors, and he said that, “It would appear that one of the real hazards of condoning this type of operation is that discount prices are freely quoted by large portion of the public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.261" offset="4832423">Now, the letter which General Motors sent out set forth a company policy that it thought selling from discount houses threatened the good will of the dealer organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.760" offset="4878399">It said that these sales don't represent an additional iota of business for the dealer organization who off of the factories and that they represent no savings to the public but result only in a delusion of the gross profit on each transaction which otherwise be made by the franchise dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.560" offset="4949661">Then the letter went on and pointed out at page 756 of the record, that in some instances these sales through discount houses represent the establishment of a second and unauthorized sales outlet or location contrary to the provisions of the Chevrolet dealers selling agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.489" offset="5045373">This was referenced to a provision in the franchise contract which Chevrolet address into every one of its dealers under which the dealer is prohibited without the advanced written approval of Chevrolet from all -- changing his place of business or from opening up any branch location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.362" offset="5120815">And it is this provision which General Motors relies on primarily as a defense in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.397" offset="5144952">The letter then concluded that the Chevrolet wholesale organization would discuss this matter with each of the dealers in those areas where such activity is reported to exist and ask them to review their operations in the light of the critical nature of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.577" offset="5217677">In other words, this letter made it quite clear that in the area where discount houses' selling was taking place, that is, at this time Los Angeles, that this matter was being brought to the attention of all the dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.463" offset="5273266">The General Motors is making clear to all the dealers in the area that it didn't want them to sell through discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.311" offset="5296567">Apparently, it paid heed to Mr. O'Connor's belief that for the dealers to give this up, they would have to receive some assurances that the others wouldn't pick it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.168" offset="5344005">And the General Motors management instructed the personnel to meet with every dealer in the office and bring this letter to their attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.800" offset="5378591">The dealers who were reported to have been selling through discount houses in Los Angeles, there were seven of them who were the principal sellers, were singled out to special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.392" offset="5424985">The manager of the Pacific Coast region for General Motors which is the echelon above the Los Angeles zone was a Mr. Cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.581" offset="5465736">And Mr. Cash was instructed to meet personally with every one of these dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.338" offset="5488724">He met with six or seven of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.623" offset="5497814">And in addition to that, the lower echelon management people in the Los Angeles office were instructed to get in touch and either meet or call all of the other dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.180" offset="5552044">And a General Motors official in Detroit subsequently explained in the memorandum that the reason this was done was that in order that every dealer with whom the subject was discussed would know that a similar discussion being held with all other dealers so that if certain dealers should elect to discontinue their cooperation with the discount house, we might be able to discourage some other dealer who might be solicited from starting the practice, that's at record 874.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.331" offset="5668655">And the Los Angeles manager that stated at record 158 to 159 that they knew that 100% cooperation in discontinuing this discount house business was essential to the success of the program to end this type of selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.214" offset="5728214">In other words, once again, a recognition by the General Motors peak management that everybody had to be assured the problem was being dealt with.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.663" offset="6174072">Now, I think it's something else that is quite significant here that General Motors is very explicit to its dealers and that to its management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.061" offset="6223600">The dealers were all to be met with individually not in groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.681" offset="6238124">Each dealer was to be met with individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.036" offset="6251499">And the Vice President of General Motors Mr. Roche pressed on this on the cross-examinations to why this why was done and he finally explained at record 399, at the top of the page, and was asked, “Why was not done in a group basis” and the answer was “Because if it were handled on a group basis, I suppose we could've been charged with a conspiracy, in conspiring with the dealers as a group to accomplish this discount house referral elimination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.217" offset="6380231">Now, Mr. Cash called in and met with six of the dealers who are the principle people in selling through discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.063" offset="6415653">He had private meetings with every one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.925" offset="6427042">He met with them very briefly for about five minutes at his own headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.041" offset="6443551">In each instance, he asked them if they had read the letter they had and reviewed the letter with them, and then he said, “This is our policy and we'd like you to reconsider your discount house operations in the light of this policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.382" offset="6500916">And not surprisingly, all of the dealers agreed and indicated in the circumstances, some of them decided, they waited for a few days and see what the others were doing to terminate these actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.837" offset="6954715">-- General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.572" offset="6957641">And that's where the principle, at least some of the most objectionable from the point of view of dealers selling was taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.371" offset="6996825">And as result of these conferences and these discussions, these dealers terminated selling through discount houses very abruptly in a matter of the week or two that was end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.348" offset="7048756">But the mere termination of these practices wasn't enough, because General Motors recognized that even if they got the dealers to stop initially, they'd have to police this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.698" offset="7090134">They'd have to make sure that the dealers didn't resume it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.176" offset="7112077">And after Mr. Cash had reported sometime in January to General Motors of the success of these initial meetings in terminating the sales through discount houses, it was then agreed between the parties that after a little time had elapsed, it would be well for Mr. Cash, and this is at record 874 a letter, “It would be well for Mr. Cash to make the necessary arrangements to actually shop some of the discount houses in order to see if any Chevrolet dealers were still corroborating with them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.833" offset="7246660">And indeed this letter which was dated on January 18 pointed out that Mr. Cash had been asked to start his shopping the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.106" offset="7283754">And when Mr. Cash mentioned to Mr. O'Connor the next day, the Los Angeles manager that he had these instruction was about to do it, start it in, O'Connor said there was no need to do it at that time, because he said he had been told that the dealers themselves intended to do some shopping and see if there was still any sales through discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.120" offset="7367868">Now, this was about the time when the three dealer associations hired a professional shopper for a $1000 a month to go out and shop for new Chevrolets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.638" offset="7413948">Each of these associations contributed $5000 to a fund to be used to purchase new Chevrolet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.220" offset="7444250">And in the next three months, the shopper and his assistants purchased seven cars at various discount houses that were supplied by some of the Los Angeles dealers to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.978" offset="7495241">In each case when the shopper went along he had a little tape recorder with him in which he got a recording of actually what was going on including the identity, of course, of the dealer who was delivering the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.360" offset="7540799">He then turned over both the tapes and the cars which have been obtained and the documents of the title to Mr. O'Connor, the zone manager in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.162" offset="7591999">And this of course was the man who told Mr. Cash that there was no need for him at that time to do any shopping because he understood what the dealers were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.430" offset="7625122">When the dealers told him about the first car they were shopping and asked him if he'd like to see this evidence, he said he would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.118" offset="7655842">Now, when the zone office in Los Angeles got this material, this proof of the discount house shopping, they then called in, in each case, the dealer who had let the car be sold through the discount house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.053" offset="7719581">They called him into the office, they played the tape recording back to him, to the dealer's apparent embarrassment in many instances, and then they asked him would he like to repurchase the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.451" offset="7757197">In every instance, the dealer said he would, and the dealers purchased these cars back, even though in several cases, they had to pay to make the check out for more than they had sold it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.150" offset="7807979">And then after Mr. O'Connor received the money for the repurchase of the car, he in turn turned it over to an attorney who was the agent of the three associations which had arranged for this shopping of cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.805" offset="7874644">Now these are the basic facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.089" offset="7883734">Now, there're some details in the record that these were basic facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.702" offset="7898154">And in discussing the fact, I would like to take two aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.584" offset="7917693">First, rather briefly, is what I would call the horizontal aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.097" offset="7935770">That is our claim that there was a horizontal conspiracy at the same level of distribution, the conspiracy among the dealers in the association and that General Motors then joined in it and implemented it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.981" offset="7991254">And the second aspect of the case which is -- which most of our brief is directed which is what I will call the vertical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.789" offset="8018526">That is the question of validity of General Motors applying its franchise agreements to prevent the dealers from selling through discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.306" offset="8060635">Now as far as the horizontal aspect of the conspiracy is concerned, what we have here is that as early as June, the Losor deal has all got together and decided they ought to get do something to persuade General Motors to stop this discount house selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.056" offset="8131584">They went to the local zone manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.897" offset="8139003">He told them he couldn't do anything about it, they needed stronger -- stronger measures were in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.233" offset="8160319">Some of the dealers they had spoken to tell them they wouldn't give up discount house selling, it was a profitable business unless they had some assurances that the other people doing the same thing would also give it up and it's obvious, only General Motors itself who would be able to provide that assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.134" offset="8239940">Then the dealers decided to send letters -- agreed to send letters and communications to General Motors protesting about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.930" offset="8271078">In response to these protests, General Motors then implemented and announced this policy against discount housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.291" offset="8308485">They dramatically brought it home to the offending dealers in the area who were selling through the discount houses by these private meetings with Mr. Cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.116" offset="8343803">Incidentally, several of the dealers testified, this was the first time they'd ever had a private meeting with that high an official of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.304" offset="8380583">And it didn't require much in the way of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.455" offset="8393226">Certainly, no threats turned the trick, five minute meeting was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.592" offset="8405765">Mr. Cash indicated the policy and at that point the dealers agreed to go along with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.163" offset="8431992">And also at the same time, General Motors made it quite clear that it was bringing this policy home to all the dealers in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.248" offset="8464384">In other words, dealers who discontinued dealing with discount houses was quite clear to them that a similar pitch was being made to the rest of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.940" offset="8499179">And the result of all of this was a virtually complete closing off to the discount houses of their sources of supply of new Chevrolets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.092" offset="8539721">And a substantial number of people, 2000 in 1960, who previously had looked to the discount houses for their Chevrolets could no longer look to that source of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.573" offset="8585697">And then to make sure that the practice was stopped, General Motors with the help of these three associations vigorously policed the dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.296" offset="8624567">They practice a type of enforcement which it did itself recognize was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.550" offset="8637524">So even if what we have in this case here, this aspect of it is joint concerted effort between General Motors and the dealers to stop the sale of new Chevrolets through discount houses and to present -- prevent any resumption of it, it was a plan that was organized, instigated by the dealers but one that could not be made effective without the cooperation and assistance of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.452" offset="8757164">General Motors, in response to the organizers, requests and protests did bring its power to bear and it therefore effectuated and implemented the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.000" offset="8803349">And we think that this comes within the decisions of this Court recognizing that a -- such a concerted refusal to deal is a per se boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.087" offset="8843682">The facts in some of the cases, as our opponents point out in their briefs, are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.450" offset="8861132">Of course, they're different but the basic philosophy of those cases that traders cannot get together and bring and prevent -- themselves get together and prevent dealing with someone else, it seems to us, applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.922" offset="8919019">Now, the second issue in the case involves the vertical restraints so-called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.634" offset="8945873">That is the claim of General Motors that by in stopping its dealers from dealing through discount houses, it was merely enforcing the branch location provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.351" offset="8988818">Now, we consider -- get to this issue for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.938" offset="9003133">The first is a question of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.755" offset="9014418">If the Court were to accept our argument on the horizontal conspiracy, it's not clear to us that that we would be entitled to relief not just against the conspiracy itself, but also the relief which we sought in our complaint limiting General Motors in preventing the -- limiting General Motors from saying to its dealers whom you can deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.713" offset="9110235">In other words, the -- we think the vice, the vice of this thing in terms of its impact on competition is stopping the dealers from dealing with the discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.763" offset="9154435">And unless there is some relief that prevents General Motors unilaterally from doing the same thing, we don't think we've accomplished any great deal if all we get is act of relief against concerted action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.162" offset="9204067">We think that the theory of our case is broad enough to give us this relief and we asked for it in the complaint but we don't know whether we would get.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.557" offset="9233638">Therefore, we cannot say that getting -- winning -- if we would win the case on the conspiracy ground, that would necessarily give us to all the relief we're entitled and therefore we find ourselves compelled to reach the second issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.332" offset="9284733">The second point of the case is that this, of course, was the ground on which General Motors defended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.212" offset="9312214">This issue was injected into the case by General Motors, defense of the franchise system.This was the issue to which most of its evidence was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.914" offset="9347009">Now, I have to state, in all candor, that at the trial level, we did state that one or two times that we were basing our case on conspiracy and that we were not attacking the contract as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.437" offset="9401135">And to that extent, the position here is somewhat inconsistent with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.282" offset="9416495">On the other hand, it's clear that there's no possible prejudice could result to General Motors from this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.243" offset="9440319">They put in their complete defense on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.552" offset="9449618">They put in every possible justification for it, and we think that the record before this Court, these three ones is now fully adequate for the Court to resolve the issue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="2435.417" offset="9845008">Now, I think it would be helpful in describing the franchise system, first to basically explain to the Court as we understand what General Motors argument is, and then to show why we don't think the argument holds up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.049" offset="9903522">General Motors' argument is basically this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.147" offset="9915956">General Motors said -- says that over the past 30 or 40 years, it has had a great deal of experience and merchandising automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.072" offset="9955662">That it has made great many studies and knows intimately all the details of the marketing practices, the buying practices of costumers, and it is therefore able to pinpoint in a particular area just how many dealers there should be and where the dealers should be put.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.218" offset="10040195">In other words, in the Los Angeles area, the General Motors on the basis of all these marketing surveys has concluded that 85 dealers is the optimum number for selling Chevrolets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.750" offset="10086379">And also the places throughout the area where the dealers have been located are the best possible places in terms of providing each dealer with a sufficient profit potential for his market so that he will be willing to make the investment that is required for the premises of a functioning and efficient dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.209" offset="10184182">Now, they then say the next thing that the branch location provision which General Motors has put in its dealer franchise since 1940 that is a purpose of avoiding a proliferation of dealer outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.580" offset="10245726">In other words, if General Motors decides that in a particular area there should be only five Chevrolet dealers, five authorized Chevrolet dealers, if a dealer were permitted to open three branches you would have not five but seven, and therefore says General Motors that provision is designed to prevent undue proliferation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.616" offset="10329840">They then say that in terms of the impact on the dealers, in terms of the purpose for which the system is set up, permitting sales through discount houses has the identical effect, insofar as the impact in the franchise system is concerned, as opening up a branch house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.910" offset="10402983">And then they conclude --</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.355" offset="11128769">The basic -- the first thing, of course, is it seems to me it has a quite different effect on competition in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.977" offset="11163251">If General Motors says to a dealer, “Mr. Dealer, we got 85 locations in Los Angeles and we don't think there should be an 86th one.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.058" offset="11207555">Barring the dealer from opening another branch does not in terms directly block off a new method of merchandising which stresses price above all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.088" offset="11263770">All that that really does is preserves General Motors' business judgment that 85 is the maximum number of dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.078" offset="11299715">But it seems, and as far as the public is concerned, this additional outlet would appear to be another authorized Chevrolet dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.216" offset="11340257">It would have the dealer's name to make it clear that he is the Chevrolet outlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.243" offset="11356348">But it seems to us it's a big jump from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.384" offset="11364916">It's a big jump from that to say that because General Motors can bar its dealers from opening another location that it could also bar the dealers themselves from a method of merchandising through which they obtain costumers not through the efforts of their own salesman, not through the effort just because people happen to walk in the door of their shop but because the costumers are referred to them by another outlet.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.619" offset="13833801">You said you cannot sell for resale -- yes I think one, I think under the antitrust laws, once they parted with all their interest in the car, that's the most they can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.007" offset="13879359">Now, I would like to refer to a few other points here in connection with the distinction between discount house selling on the one hand and merely establishment of a branch location on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.509" offset="13941426">The -- as I've indicated the branch location provision was inserted in the contract 25 years ago at General Motors' own insistence because General Motors apparently believed this was significant in merchandising its cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.813" offset="13998582">The other provisions of the contract -- I'm sorry, the application of the contract to discount house selling was done by General Motors at the instigation of the dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.289" offset="14040482">And indeed, the General Motors' president had testified that they wouldn't have acquired the policy at that time were it not for the dealers pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.359" offset="14076844">And the effort seems clear to us that in this particular situation this was -- General Motors applied this not because of any decision on its own that this was necessary for the efficient merchandising of automobiles but in response to the pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.860" offset="14146853">Now, I think there's something very significant here in determining just what this franchise -- the effect of this thing is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.303" offset="14176632">The president of General Motors testified, at page 423 of the record, that if a salesman from Glendale County, which Glendale which is a suburb of Los Angeles, came into Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.236" offset="14240266">And if he started to sell there that they say would not pose any threat to the franchise system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.503" offset="14273390">If it seems to us in terms of the concern of deluding the deal of potential, it doesn't make any difference how it gets in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.119" offset="14311842">The important thing is, if dealers for example from outside of the area started to come into Orange County to sell vigorously and if they began to stress price cutting, it seems to us that the impact on the franchise system which is the whole basis on which General Motors attempts to base its case would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.223" offset="14392299">And yet they concede that in that situation, there wouldn't be any impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.729" offset="14418317">Now, there's plenty of intra-brand competition in Los Angeles that has to be conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.293" offset="14444544">There are 85 dealers, and certainly General Motors as the largest manufacturer of automobiles cannot contend that this limitation, this bar in selling through discount houses is necessary for General Motors to compete effectively against the other brands of manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.665" offset="14522075">Indeed, the record in this case shows that the discount houses were selling all makes of automobiles not just Chevrolets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.462" offset="14557184">And if in fact General Motors starts -- prohibits its dealers from selling to these cars and there's nothing in the record to show that any of the other manufacturers to stop their deals from selling, in the long run, it seems to me it's likely to hurt General Motors in its position against the other cars rather than to help it because people may be prepared to buy a General Motors car when they walk into the discount, but if they find they can't get a Chevy through the discount house, they can only get a Ford or Plymouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.670" offset="14674004">It seems to me not at all unlikely that they will suddenly decide to shift over, and I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3661.075" offset="14747669">If you carry this all with the aid of the little map that we put in our brief at page 20, I would like to tell you about Los Angeles, because there are some misconceptions about Los Angeles in the argument of the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.446" offset="14829171">The counties involved in this litigation are Los Angeles County and a small part of Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.364" offset="14860831">Orange County extends from the Los Angeles County line down to San Diego County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.254" offset="14884342">All we have involved in this litigation is Los Angeles County and a little piece of Orange County, not several counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.932" offset="14923107">With respect to the City of Los Angeles, as the Chief Justice knows and no doubt many of you know, the City of Los Angeles is sprawled all over the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.165" offset="14972008">It surrounds the City of Beverly Hills and it's very difficult as one drives along whether you're in the City of Los Angeles or in one of the suburban towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.126" offset="15011924">On the little map up in the left hand corner where there are quite a number of discount houses, that's San Fernando Valley that's at City of Los Angeles, several discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.036" offset="15055496">Actually, there are 18 discount houses in Los Angeles County of which several of them, quite a number of them, were within the city limits of Los Angeles, if that's of any importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.382" offset="15116936">Commercially, as everyone knows, commercially this metropolitan area is one commercial area and the boundary lines don't make much difference except for political purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.516" offset="15157478">Looking at the name Los Angeles there, just to the left of the name Los Angeles is a discount house 4A, just below that is another discount house called Fleet Sales Inc. just below that is another discount house called Bedco, just off to the left of that in the City of Los Angeles is another discount house called Castle Sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.453" offset="15241174">So this matter occurring to make Orange County heavy in this matter is just a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.113" offset="15267819">Actually, 85% of the transactions certainly, we can tell for sure 70% of the discount house transactions took place in Los Angeles County, and because several of these operations had places of business both in Los Angeles County and Orange County, we can't be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.282" offset="15344515">But a fair estimate is that about 15% of the discount house transactions took place in Orange County, and about 85% took place in Los Angeles County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.323" offset="15392684">With respect to the complaining dealers, nine of them -- nine of the dealers whose salesman complained or the dealers complained, nine were in Los Angeles County, six in Orange County.</text>

            <text syncTime="3946.867" offset="15890892">On the dealer financial statement it's separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.452" offset="15901132">So you can tell what the dealer's gross profit is every gross profit for new cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.828" offset="15926732">Discount houses, Your Honor, are selling to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.971" offset="15947212">They aren't making commercial sales, but dealers make huge numbers of commercial sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.738" offset="15970304">So you really can't make a comparison of how the dealer sells to the public and they should think out the commercial sales, because those commercial sales tend to drag down the average price for car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.359" offset="16016802">You see, in the City of Los Angeles, there are tremendous numbers of commercial sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.351" offset="16048776">Naturally, in that vast industrial area the dealers are selling people like (Inaudible) drive yourself, leasing corporations, Los Angeles Police Department, Avis Rent-a-Car Corporations and so on and they sell with respect to the seven dealers studied by Price Waterhouse for us, they sell 28% of their cars commercially.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.063" offset="16139577">So if you add those in at very little mark ups, then that makes it look as though the Los Angeles dealers are selling very cheaply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.046" offset="16171551">When in point of fact, when you take those out and if you are able to take them out as we did in the Price Waterhouse study, you may well find that the Los Angeles County or City dealers are selling to the public as cheaply or even cheaper, I mean, that the Orange County dealers are selling to the public as cheap or cheaper than the Los Angeles County dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.753" offset="16278340">The figures are not in the record to make the kind of an argument that the Government's making.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.194" offset="16312195">And I think one of Your Honors asked whether we're prejudiced by it if they had chosen this course, you know we went through this twice a criminal case and a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.545" offset="16365589">And the complaint in the civil case is identical with the indictment in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.107" offset="16391816">And never did they talk about attacking the vertical agreement as an unreasonable restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.880" offset="16410937">They refused to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.250" offset="16420342">If such a thing had been done, we could've had what White Motors said to require an economic study of the whole thing and found out the correct answer to your question, but it isn't in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.746" offset="16478333">Mr. Justice Fortas asked about the transaction, perhaps I can assist you.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.375" offset="16508844">The car is owned by the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.145" offset="16519920">In the State of California, only the dealer can transfer title to the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.781" offset="16538520">We have a system of registration by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.408" offset="16560985">When the discount house, I'm not talking about the referral type sale, and there are even variations of this but a typical method at least is for the discount house to have an arrangement with the dealer to furnish a car to his costumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.848" offset="16638725">And the -- he gets a power of attorney from the costumer to sign the contract at a price that he establishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.283" offset="16680521">This price is over and above what the dealer is wiling to let go of the car for, and it can be any sum of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.506" offset="16713435">He can add to it and that's why not all these discount house sales were so cheap.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.808" offset="16730572">He can add to it what he chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.060" offset="16739662">The dealer signs the contract to the costumer for the total price which includes the discount house fellow's profit and the discount house fellow takes that contract and signs on behalf of the costumer, takes it to the finance company and discounts the paper, takes the money, hands it to the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.770" offset="16830464">In most instances of this kind, he handle, he the discount house fellow, handled the trade-in car.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.462" offset="16857213">Which again, it makes all these talk about what the discount house is selling for, is a little hard to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.548" offset="16881560">Because as -- anybody that's bought a car well knows the seller of the car can take your trade-in car in under its real value and pretend to give you a great bargain by selling you a car at a very low markup and all of a sudden really the real transaction is not a bargain at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.562" offset="16957628">So this matter of talking about discount house bargains can not be done in a breeze.</text>

            <text syncTime="4936.632" offset="19849906">What we have here if a dealer can't himself establish an outlet but can simply make an arrangement of the discount house to sell his cars for him, however you characterize the legal terms of the transaction, if he can make another -- make an arrangement with another place whether it's a discount house or supermarket or what, to sell a dealer's car for him, the dealer has got another business location to which he sells cars.</text>

            <text syncTime="6017.039" offset="24171499">They make a great deal of their claim that the costumer could purchase for less through a discount house.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.796" offset="24222595">Actually the only way we can make any price comparison is to look at the Price Waterhouse study, because that is the only study which compares retail prices to ordinary costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6046.378" offset="24288841">And we find there as these seven dealers, five of them in the City of Los Angeles, one in Glendale, one in Pasadena.</text>
            <text syncTime="6056.024" offset="24327502">We find there that there are variances in the prices at which they sell to their regular costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.287" offset="24352475">A citizen Chevrolet located up there in Eagle Rock, which Chief Justice I'm sure knows where it is, between Pasadena and Glendale.</text>
            <text syncTime="6071.930" offset="24391137">Of the man studied, he's the low, low dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6075.077" offset="24403675">And remember, these men are all selling through discount houses, out of what is supposedly low prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.821" offset="24426663">Mr. Biggs is the second in Vermont, he's $54 higher than on the average than a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6089.447" offset="24461145">So that there is a spread normally, a differentiation of -- differential of prices normally within the City of Los Angeles and that the dealer -- the costumer has plenty of opportunity to get a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.912" offset="24535019">If he wants to -- if he lives near Biggs and is dissatisfied because Biggs is higher, then two miles away which is about four or five minutes driving in Los Angeles, easy driving, he is over at Courtesy Chevrolet who is still -- who is lower than Biggs, considerably lower, $28 lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.603" offset="24613804">Or he can go over to Brooder on Hollywood Boulevard which is about six minutes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.256" offset="24636374">Or if he really wants to get the low, low man of those studied up at Eagle Rock, this is about six miles away, 12 to 15 minutes and here's a man buying a car on the order of $3000 which he buys on the average once every 3 1/2 years, so he has plenty of opportunity even among these seven dealers to -- and in an easy manner to find a better price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6164.521" offset="24761448">I'm sure that the -- if the entire area were studied, then there would be a great variation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6170.747" offset="24786317">I can't whether citizens would be the lowest or whether Biggs would be the highest, perhaps some were even higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.022" offset="24811499">But there would be adequate opportunity within the Los Angeles area for the costumer to find a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.506" offset="24845354">So far as Orange County is concerned, Orange County is -- you can't tell when you go from Los Angeles County to Orange County anymore, it's all build up.</text>
            <text syncTime="6196.980" offset="24891329">And if there are not dealers in Orange County, we don't know what they were selling their retail costumers for.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.877" offset="24922885">But if by any chance who were not a dealer there satisfactory to the costumer, it's very easy to drive 15 miles in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6214.536" offset="24961546">Very easy indeed, I do it every morning and every night, and it takes no time at all to get to dealers within the 15-mile radius of the average dealer in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.353" offset="25024763">There are 34 other dealer outlets where he can find a bargain, 34 opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.850" offset="25054751">It's very simple matter and the franchise system is so designed as to enable the prospective costumer to find a bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.719" offset="25114206">No dealer sells regularly at any price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6257.662" offset="25134059">Every transaction is a new bargain and every costumer in the area has an adequate opportunity to purchase, and actually, the discount house does not introduce any new competition in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.184" offset="25196126">All the discount house does is to provide a place of business where some of these large dealers, most of them rather large dealers to have another outlet perhaps near some smaller dealer at which to do business.</text>

            <text syncTime="6435.267" offset="25844485">The three appellee dealers association, Losor is made up of a group of small businessmen who are Chevrolet dealers in a portion of Los Angeles County and a portion of Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="6455.094" offset="25923793">The other dealer association, Dealer Service, is made up also of a group of independent businessmen who are Chevrolet dealers in the Los Angeles City area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6471.946" offset="25991189">The Foothill Dealers Association is made up of also Chevrolet dealers partially in Los Angeles County, San Bernardino County and a couple in Riverside County.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.119" offset="26059839">These organizations were formed many years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="6494.218" offset="26080214">They are not in any way connected with, controlled by or supervised by General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.633" offset="26105919">They were organized for three main purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.293" offset="26120547">There are so many different models and colors and accessories that can be placed on Chevrolet automobiles that were enable for a dealer to get the model that he desires for his costumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6521.875" offset="26190869">He can call his dealers association that maintains what is known as a trading bureau or information bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="6530.848" offset="26226813">They have a list of the inventory of all the dealers in the association and can readily make known to the inquiring dealer where he might purchase or trade with another dealer to get the automobile that he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6549.302" offset="26300583">In addition to that, the dealers association enables the dealers to have joint advertisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6560.502" offset="26345409">And as a third reason or purpose for the association, they are able to study the problems of automobile merchandising and recommend legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.781" offset="26410506">And in this case, there is evidence of the effect that such association did recommend legislation to the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="6588.798" offset="26458572">Now, we are making two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="6592.347" offset="26472782">The first point is that the appellant had raise no question whatsoever which relates to the dealers association.</text>
            <text syncTime="6603.354" offset="26516773">The question in the notice of appeal, the question in the jurisdictional statement and the questions in the brief they were one each in the former and there are two in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6616.185" offset="26568077">Whether the agreement between General Motors and each of its Chevrolet dealers, the Los Angeles area forbidding the dealer to sell cars to discount houses unreasonably restrains trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.389" offset="26628890">And second, whether the Chevrolet dealers in the Los Angeles area illegally conspired among themselves and with General Motors to suppress such sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="6644.014" offset="26679463">There is not an iota of evidence of any agreement, association or conspiracy as between General Motors and the dealers association.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.386" offset="26740903">There is no contention made but there was and there is no evidence of any association agreement or conspiracy between the Chevrolet dealers, General Motors and the Chevrolet dealers association.</text>

            <text syncTime="7168.076" offset="28775633">Now, the final thing -- point I'd like to make is this, there's been a lot of discussion here as to whether discount houses do give peoples bargains or don't give people bargains.</text>
            <text syncTime="7178.295" offset="28816593">If they don't, if in fact the discount houses aren't charging more than the other dealers, it seems to me sooner or later they're going to go by the way side.</text>
            <text syncTime="7187.243" offset="28852328">You can fool some of the people some other time, but we know you can't fool them all of the time, and over a long period of time, these discount houses are not going to be able to survive if the people who believe they're getting bargains find out they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="7199.658" offset="28901961">Now, on the other hand, if what all of these complaining dealers and salesman said about this situation was true that the discount houses were undercutting, that the dealers were unable to make sales because of the lower prices given by the discount houses, then it seems to me they chose one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="7220.636" offset="28985866">Either it indicates that somehow the franchise method of distribution is not as efficient as it supposed to be or alternatively, it suggests that perhaps the competition among the dealers isn't as vigorous as it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="7234.876" offset="29042918">Because the discount house starts, it starts its competitive position under a very great financial handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="7244.010" offset="29079385">The dealer buys his car from General Motors at a stated price.</text>
            <text syncTime="7248.839" offset="29098715">The discount house, in order to compete against the dealer, pays not only the price that the dealer paid, because the dealer turns it over to him, but also another profit for dealer and enters into, so that makes out of the deal, so that the discount house starts with a distinct competitive advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="7266.719" offset="29170291">Now, if in fact over a period of time, these discount houses despite that competitive handicap are able to prosper, if a large number of people prefer to buy cars that way, if they think they're getting bargains they continue to get those bargains, it seems to us that this is basically what the antitrust law is designed to permit, to allow a new type of merchandising.</text>
            <text syncTime="7293.317" offset="29276662">To allow a situation which although like in some respectsa branch location, it is a place where cars are sold in a terminal location, there's many difference as far as the public are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="7305.583" offset="29325667">And it seems to us that the whole thing about this is to impact on competition and if in fact these discount houses are able to survive despite these competitive handicaps, it suggests to us quite clearly and they're popular that if General Motors tries to eliminate them, this we think does constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade</text>
