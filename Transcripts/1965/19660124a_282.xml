            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 282, Harry J. Amell et al., petitioners versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.309" offset="160580">Mr. Scribner.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Scribner</label>
            <text syncTime="15.840" offset="166745">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.412" offset="185031">This case involves a number of government employees, albeit seamen on government vessels subject to civil service laws and subject to all the rules and regulations applicable to all government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.975" offset="263293">They made claims in the District Court for overtime pay which they alleged were due them, this is in three of the cases, pursuant to federal laws and regulations all pertaining to government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.334" offset="360678">In addition, they relied on the Classification Act, the Federal Employee Pay act, and as I said other regulations pertaining to the issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.018" offset="411460">The Court of Claims on the motion of the government transferred each of the four cases to the District Courts, in this case the District Court of Florida, District Court in New York, southern district and to other appropriate courts, on the apparent ground, we have presumed this since the Court of Claims rendered no opinion made no statement except that it cited forming cases that it had transferred like without opinion like without in the same manner without any indication to us as to why they did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.752" offset="562343">We must assume of course that that was done simply because it was the Court's opinion consonant with the approach made by the government that the suits in Admiralty Act applied and that therefore the cases were properly in admiralty and within the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.794" offset="646562">Of course here we have a relatively simple situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.911" offset="658996">It doesn't raise many the complications that have been raised over the years and I frankly was surprised to learn of the difficulties that were involved in the general area of the application of the suits in Admiralty Act and the activity of this Court in connection with it, but this matter is a relatively simple matter in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.722" offset="730258">The suits here are brought under legislation and under regulation which has literally no relationship to admiralty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.155" offset="792012">The particular pieces of legislation, enactments relate wholly and exclusively to government employees albeit among those government employees necessarily as some who work on vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.459" offset="853243">It appears to be the position of the government that if any employee works on a vessel that's afloat and if waters are involved that somehow principles of admiralty or admiralty law are also necessarily involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.441" offset="925132">The fact is that the basis of the claims made by the petitioners has no relationship to admiralty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.650" offset="973928">Now any principle of admiralty law that would be involved here would be encompassed essentially by Title 46 of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.094" offset="1007783">There is not one section in Title 46, which also encompasses the suits in Admiralty Act as well as the Public Vessels Act, which would in any way be determinative or which could be considered even in respect to a decision to be made on the claims in these cases, literally not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.307" offset="1132648">Now a lawyer in an argument seldom challenges his adversary to produce something because he might and it's too big a risk, but I'll venture to say that the government in addressing themselves to this Court could not point to a single enactment or provision of law under Title 46 or under any aspect of admiralty law that would in any way affect the determination of a court as to whether the petitioners should or should not prevail as government employees in their wage claims against the United States in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.192" offset="1304116">There is literally nothing, I am confident there is nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.858" offset="1318849">Now the government first makes the statement, and categorically by the way in their brief, that admiralty law is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.468" offset="1353226">There is no admiralty law involved and they can't point to a piece of legislation which would affect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.941" offset="1379140">Then there is another approach to it and that is that principles of admiralty law apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.070" offset="1403695">Well, admiralty law would still have to be applied whether or not it embraces the principle or a -- an ad hoc approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.357" offset="1432848">Then they recede apparently from that position as they develop their argument in the brief and they talk in terms of something called a claim of a maritime nature or a claim of a maritime character, and of course that's meaningless because that could only relate to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.970" offset="1523231">It can only relate to principles of law which are expressed in law somewhere in Title 46, or in any other places they could find it if they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.566" offset="1565654">It is significant that in not in one place in their brief is there a citation to any law, admiralty law, which would apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.642" offset="1617899">Now what I found rather curious, and I was rather disappointed in the office, that the government cites a series of some ten cases in two different places in the brief in support of a proposition that the courts have uniformly held that government employed seamen who sue for wages are relegated to the suits in Admiralty Act, or the Public Vessels Act as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.288" offset="1776515">It's sad to say that those cases and I say that professionally, that those cases do no support that contention and that anybody who read the cases would know what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.254" offset="1824371">And what they referred to are the cases, all the theories of cases I could cite another hundreds of them, which relate to the situation where under the Clarification Act which embraced the war shipping board type of situation during war time or war time or related activities where the government through the war shipping administration and through agents, private companies hired seamen as government employees on a temporary basis in order to carry out certain government merchant type of activity.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="474.111" offset="1999809">Why does the government want to change it?</text>
            <text syncTime="476.435" offset="2009109">Why does the government want them tried in the other courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="478.535" offset="2017468">What is the real reason?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_scribner" startTime="479.083" stopTime="584.240">
            <label>Mr. David Scribner</label>
            <text syncTime="479.083" offset="2019662">Oh there is a simple reason is that in the other courts, the government saves money and the employees lose money.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.956" offset="2039202">There's a six-year statute limitations from the Court of Claims and there's a two-year statute limitation in the -- under the suits in Admiralty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.908" offset="2070967">And when that issue arose, for instance in the Johansen case and in the Patterson case which came before this Court in 1952 and I think in 1959 respectively, there the question was, there the government said that the employees there involved who were exactly in the same position that the employees here involved as regular government civil service employees that there they were not really seamen and they weren't in their vessel, but there, they were truly government employees and the reason for that, and they hardly convinced the Court with, at least a sharply divided court, and the reason for that was that again, the seaman would stand to lose by the ultimate outcome of that because this Court said that since they were government employees, albeit seaman, they were governed exclusively by the comprehensive system of laws of regulation which the legislature set up through the Federal Employee Compensation Act where injuries were involved or alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.019" offset="2331460">In other words, they are the government employees' private suit in the -- in the Court of Claims, the government said “You can't sue in” -- I'm sorry, in Suits in Admiralty Act, the government came in and said “You can't sue in the Suits in Admiralty Act because you're really not seamen, you're government employees” and the affect of that was to throw them into the Federal Employee Compensation Act where they got the effective workman's compensation rather than the opportunity to go before a jury and to get some adequate compensation for their injuries.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.240" offset="2440338">Is it your position that the only difference and result that could happen in this case bar the principles of law since that here that in one the government concedes the statute of limitation and the other one it could not?</text>

            <label>Mr. David Scribner</label>

            <text syncTime="600.073" offset="2503659">I don't know of any other substantial difference except that the general -- at doing this is a citing this is an advocate for the position, I would say that is the practical outcome of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.698" offset="2550157">Talking generally about the administration of justice in this type of area, I would say that if what I recommend to the Court is consistent with the administration of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.511" offset="2593416">Now you have laws affecting government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.117" offset="2603865">I'd say it would be improper and discriminatory to have a body of law that relates to government employees and to have excise from that those relating to government employees who are seamen, because we do have a comprehensive system of laws that relates to government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.306" offset="2668648">So that so far as the administration of justice is concerned in this particular area, it would be unfair and discriminatory in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.538" offset="2701563">I was just indicating that the practical effect of it would be to deprive government employees who are seamen of four years of claim in their claims for wages or the like.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.467" offset="2881285">What they did was to exclude them from certain provisions of the Classification Act and then the Classification Act itself provided what should apply to those particular seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.243" offset="2932381">In other words, the Classification Act for instance refers to exempt seamen from certain general wage rates and then provide specifically how the wage rate of government employees who are seamen should be determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.615" offset="4121788">On the two phases of the questions that you raise, I would have the following approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.195" offset="4160136">First, the government takes the position, and I don't think there's any question about it in this case although the orders are ambiguous, I can understand that completely, the government takes the position or else we wouldn't be here, the government takes the position that the -- that the transfers were based on their suggestion for the court below that it should be in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.301" offset="4252609">In other words, in transferring the cases to the District Court, we had a right to assume, and as a matter of fact the District Court in Florida assumed it enacted as such that they were to the admiralty side of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.700" offset="4310183">There's no question about that and that's the posture we're in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.376" offset="4320841">I thought we were in that posture and I'm certain that the government would take that position that they necessarily had to be transferred to the admiralty side of the court for the purposes of applying admiralty law and not because the District Court had concurrent jurisdiction in cases where the claim were less than $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.357" offset="4400776">In other words, that's not the applicable feature in this case and I'm sure that's the position or else we wouldn't be arguing this case before as that we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.301" offset="4436616">There isn't a word for the contrary in the position taken on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.699" offset="4450200">Now so far as the concurrent jurisdiction is concerned where there is concurrent jurisdiction in claims under $10,000.00 as there is under the statute, as under the Tucker Act, the fact is that it would be up to the plaintiff, the petitioner, to determine what court he wants to win.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.619" offset="4541837">We went into the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.937" offset="4547166">Now it's not suggested by the government that we're in the wrong court in that level.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.038" offset="4695542">That was not the motion made by the government and that was not the basis apparently on which the Court acted because it didn't say anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.774" offset="4926464">But what it does not show at any time that it's exclusive as to seamen working on the private seamen working on government vessels or claims by private individuals or corporations whatever it is against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.268" offset="4984456">And -- but so far as government employees is concerned, that is taking a whole classification and covering them under admiralty, there isn't a word in the legislative history that would assist us one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.113" offset="5043806">My view is that in the absence of any direct approach for this government problem, government employee problem, which is not a small problem, in the absence of any direct approach by Congress, I would say it would be analogous to the situation of Federal Employees Claim Act that where the -- where there is legislation which specifically affects government employees there has to be a specific intent or express intent, expressed in legislation, of Congress to deprive them or to take them out of that general classification and put them into classification of seamen rather than government employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.174" offset="5280057">But I would say it's a fair statement to make that if Congress had intended to take government employees out of their class as government employees, albeit if they were seamen, and put them into a different class seamen then they would've said so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.929" offset="5523101">Before beginning my argument, I would like to address myself to a question that Mr. Justice Fortas asked, and that is the ground of the Court of Claims order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.770" offset="5570435">It is my understanding that prior to 1960, there could be no transfer between the Court of Claims and the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.481" offset="5613275">And when in 1960, Congress enacted what is now 28 U.S.C., 1506, providing for a transfer from the Court of Claims to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.129" offset="5659878">It did so on the assumption that there, the legislative history clearly shows that prior to that time there couldn't be such a transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.095" offset="5699793">And that statute only provides for a transfer where the jurisdiction of the District Court is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.829" offset="5738663">So and that of course would transfer provision we invoke that the jurisdiction of the District Court was exclusive in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.952" offset="5783176">So I don't think that the Court of Claims would have had any power to transfer a case cognizable under the Tucker Act or under $10,000.00 where there's concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.240" offset="5848377">I think the choice that the plaintiff -- the choice is completely of the plaintiffs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.741" offset="5870320">The government has no right to deprive the plaintiff of that choice under the Tucker Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.320" offset="6104691">Now if they were employed upon a merchant vessel and there was no transfer, the Court of Claims would dismiss the suit and it would have to be filed anew in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.786" offset="6158503">And of course sometimes, during that period of time limitations would expire and a new suit could not be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.505" offset="6189432">And this is one of the reasons in 1960, Congress permitted transfers, one provision of the statute permitted a transfer from the Court of Claims to the District Court, another provision from the District Court to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.947" offset="6251186">For example, where Tucker Act suit was filed in the District Court or over $10,000.00 and exclusive jurisdiction would be in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.813" offset="6294653">Before 1960 the case had to be dismissed and then re-filed in the other court, but now it can be transferred and the statute of limitations is -- the statute of limitations stops to run when it was filed originally in the wrong court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2899.955" offset="11703150">Well petitioner's argument is that a government employee seaman's wage claim is not encompassed by the Suits in Admiralty Act as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.624" offset="11741915">And we think that first the clear language of the statute encompass it because it says if the government were private and if the proceeding would be -- could be maintained in admiralty, and a proceeding can be brought against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.561" offset="11801579">Certainly if the government were private ship operator or owner its employees' claims, wage claims would be in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.112" offset="11835852">This is well settled, it's been settled since the earliest days in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2939.153" offset="11859989">But even taking Johansen and Patterson applying the principles, you argue that that would come out on your side because you do have the specific statute dealing with a specific type of client.</text>

            <label>Mr. John C. Eldridge</label>
            <text syncTime="2948.931" offset="11899068">Yes and here of course this Court in Johansen and Patterson held that as between the Compensation Act and the Suits in Admiralty Act both of which the language covers the claim, exclusive jurisdiction should be under the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.162" offset="11964061">But when it comes to between the Suits in Admiralty Act and the Tucker Act, this Court held in several cases that exclusive jurisdiction is under the Suits in Admiralty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.113" offset="12003871">And Congress has legislated with reference to that on several occasions as set forth in our brief, has accepted that holding -- those holdings, and we do think that they have become part of the framework of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.953" offset="12063222">That on all maritime claims now jurisdiction is under the Suits in Admiralty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.406" offset="12089031">So we do submit that these are seaman's wage claims and if we make a final point, petitioner argues that in this type of case, a pure admiralty issue can not come up, I suggest it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.174" offset="12148067">Now, suppose one of Mr. Scribner's clients was discharged before he had earned the month's wages and was suing for his wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.761" offset="12198431">Under the decisions of the Court he would be entitled to his earned wages plus another, an extra month's wages under 46 U.S.C. 594, which has been applied to the government repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.598" offset="12249736">There could be other maritime issues and we do think that a complaint is made about watches on ships, one of the very cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.522" offset="12293413">This is the matter which the District Court sitting in admiralty are experienced and not the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.178" offset="12316087">They apply to seaman's wage statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.766" offset="12326431">Now, it may be that none of the seaman's wage statutes are applicable to the particular facts of this case although that's not clear either, because this Court reserved the question in McCrea versus United States in 294 U.S. while the government is subject to the double wage penalty and the seaman's wage statute were not paying wages when it's supposed to, and that's an unsettled question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.150" offset="12435937">If we are subject to that then his clients, I would assume, get double wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.205" offset="12468224">And that is purely a maritime issue that's a part of the seaman's wage statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.272" offset="12492466">And of course we think we point out that though under the Suits in Admiralty Act is a shorter period of limitations, there are nevertheless other advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.307" offset="12532590">They get much greater interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.917" offset="12539068">They're successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.508" offset="12545442">It's the only statute where the kind of waiver of sovereign immunity to my knowledge in permitting you to maintain acts against the United States where you can get pre-judgment interest then get cost generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.350" offset="12604792">It's the only statute I know of where you can sue the United States and can collect cost, the same cost a private person can invoke with Tucker Act, the Court of Claims Act, others have limitations on the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.953" offset="12663202">If they would have a seaman's wage claim over $10,000.00 which may be rare, they have greater venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.626" offset="12693922">So we do think that it's not all a one sided thing and just the government here trying to deprive these people of the benefit of a longer period of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.681" offset="12742092">And as we also point out in our brief, it's not clear that any of these claims would be time barred under the Suits in Admiralty Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.906" offset="12787022">We point out that a majority of them clearly would not be because 67 of the petitioners are suing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.276" offset="12820459">They filed suit in November of 1964 for a 3.5% wage increases which a private seaman got in June of 1962 and June of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.953" offset="12871137">So that's a period covering two years five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.328" offset="12884720">So certainly two years of those which are the majority of those claims where the claims of 67 of the 90 some petitioners are timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.763" offset="12926412">And depending upon how the District Court's role on these cases on the tolling issue whether the Suits in Admiralty Act limitation provisions is tolled during the pendency of administrative proceedings, they all could be timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.886" offset="12990882">But our concern is not to deprive these people of their claims because of a short period of limitation, but we, the government does think that in this type of suit admiralty issues can be involved that Congress contemplated, that maritime claims should be heard by District Courts including in admiralty, that's what this Court has held and we respectfully submit that the transfer order should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.520" offset="13109478">First, I'd like to call to your attention of what is an obvious fact and that is that the United States did waive sovereign immunity with respect to suits by government employees as early as 1887 through the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.131" offset="13167888">And the fact is that that waiver of sovereign immunity continued from that period of time to date with amendments to the Tucker Act constantly and as late as August 30, 1964 where the Congress took under consideration again the entire question of waiver of sovereign immunity in respect to the claims of government employees for wages for compensation against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.471" offset="13281259">So that it isn't as though in the Suits in Admiralty Act, we suddenly had a waiver of sovereign immunity under certain conditions which is spelled out in the Suits in Admiralty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.294" offset="13324518">As a matter of fact, the immunity, the waiver of immunity for government employees long preceded the Suits in Admiralty Act and as continued up to date.</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.168" offset="14296064">Do you agree that there are some seaman's wage statutes that ordinarily administered by the District Courts in admiralty which might be important in a -- an action by somebody like your plaintiffs?</text>

            <text syncTime="3562.736" offset="14354265">I think categorically there are absolutely none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.676" offset="14370043">The only statutes that were involved and I know they'll agree because they referred to Title 46, would be Title 46 of the Code which relates to that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.329" offset="14408704">Title 46 of the Code relates to unearned wages, maintenance and cure and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.632" offset="14429915">A reference was made a little while ago to the question of unearned wages that it might conceivably involve a government seaman in a suit for wages might conceivably come within the comforts of 46.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.624" offset="14473906">It is absolutely inaccurate, he can not come, there are no articles, no government employee who acts as a seaman cites on co-shipping articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.172" offset="14512044">The shipping articles spell out the application of Title 46, it spells out specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.194" offset="14536182">Another thing that was mentioned was that there was a question as to whether or not a government seaman would be entitled to a month's pay because of the scope of his employment or the articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.425" offset="14577037">That's under his articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.163" offset="14584038">Articles are required under Title 46, the interpretation of articles are requirement of Title 42.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.821" offset="14630640">What you are saying to us as I understand it is that the scheme of law applicable to seaman for a government employee is separate and isolated from the scheme of laws that are -- is applicable to actions by seamen who are private employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3675.157" offset="14803989">The Title 46 is available to all of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.515" offset="14813393">It does not apply to government employees just as it doesn't apply to someone, a typist in Kansas City who's a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.679" offset="14850069">It would apply as little to a Kansas City typist who is a government employee as it would to seaman who is employed by the government in civil service in the civil service area on a government vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.688" offset="14894164">Exactly there is not difference insofar as the application of admiralty law is concerned.</text>
