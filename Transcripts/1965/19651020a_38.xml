            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 38, Alfred D. Rosenblatt, Petitioner, versus Frank P. Baer.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.615" offset="201853">Mr. Nighswander.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur H. Nighswander</label>
            <text syncTime="26.912" offset="211048">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.908" offset="231006">In granting our petition for certiorari, the order of this Court stated that counsel had directed in addition to argue the question whether at the time of respondent's employment as supervisor of a public recreation area, he was a public official under the decisions of this Court in New York Times against Sullivan and Garrison against Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.187" offset="328077">By placing a case on the court list for summary argument, we assume that the Court is interested primarily in the very important question which is left unanswered by New York Times and Garrison as to where the line shall be drawn with respect to the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.073" offset="407698">The question is whether this Court having enunciated New York Times a constitutional rule which appears to us to be clear and sound should now limit the rule to public officials in the very narrow sense as argued by the respondent here or include within it public employees who may technically fail to meet a very narrow test, but who nevertheless by reason of the positions they hold, such as the respondent here, have responsibility and authority for action or decision in an area in which the public has a legitimate interest and concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.216" offset="544266">In New York Times, the plaintiff or the Commissioner for the City of Montgomery, Alabama in charge of police, the court said “We have no occasion here to determine how far down the lower ranks into the lower ranks of government employees the public official designation would extend for purposes of this rule, or otherwise to specify categories of persons who would or would not be included.”</text>
            <text syncTime="133.753" offset="638412">Now, if we did not believe that the respondent here falls within the scope of New York Times as a public official and if we did not believe that the alleged defamatory question had to do with his official conduct, if in fact they referred to him at all, we should not now be before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.021" offset="707480">Although an excellent argument could be made, and I refer you to the brief of the American Civil Liberties Union filed here as an amicus, for a rule which commits comment on all matters of public concern and about all public servants or employees or even public men, when such statements are not accompanied by malice in the constitutional sense, we prefer to argue this case on its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.096" offset="815731">The respondent was not only a public man or a public employee.He was in fact public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.412" offset="841017">Now, in the Garrison case decided in November 23rd, 1964, after the New Hampshire Supreme Court decision in this case, the plaintiffs, you will recall, were judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.516" offset="889396">What was said about them was in their official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.182" offset="900054">No mention is made in this decision as to whether they were elected or appointed which appears to the court apparently to be of no importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.381" offset="928893">Now, the next cases were the companion cases of Henry v. Collins and Henry v. Pearson decided in this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.932" offset="955120">Now here, one plaintiff was the chief of police and the other was a county attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.847" offset="970794">And again, the court appears to have had no great difficulty in bringing them within the scope of public official rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.716" offset="998275">It is evident that there's already been some broadening of the rule since New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.474" offset="1017292">Now comparing the case at bar, it should be borne in mind that the respondent, as in New York Times, was not mentioned by name or reference made specifically to the manager of the appellant area such.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.592" offset="1069746">The fact that comparison was made only with respect to the area commission and manager together as compared with prior management, the specific words used in the article were “What magic has Dana Beane?”</text>
            <text syncTime="257.132" offset="1131917">That is a new Commissioner and rest of Commission and Mr. Warner who was the new manager under the new authority set up by state legislature “wrought to make such many difference in that cash results?”</text>
            <text syncTime="273.609" offset="1197850">Logically then, we say that the comparison sought to be made was with the county commissioners who were elected, and Baer the manager on the one hand with the management.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.714" offset="1246229">Now, no effort was made in the article to pinpoint any responsibility or to accuse any one.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.570" offset="1269635">Now, consider the facts than in the light of New York Times and Henry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.890" offset="1290951">Baer's a party over the operation on the taxpayer on and tax for the recreation area delegated him by statute by the county commissions with approval of the county delegation and evidence by a written contract included --</text>

            <text syncTime="854.704" offset="3522226">One question that we think is pertinent here is whether the respondent should be able to enlarge the meaning of the words used in the question by innuendo to include himself within the group, and thus to enforce liability while others in the same group cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.828" offset="3586696">Now, this would be analogous to holding that while the police Commissioner of Montgomery was not specifically mentioned, could not recover without proof of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.954" offset="3619192">The police chief has subordinate, could claim that he too was included in the state by innuendo, therefore, could bring a suit even though his superior could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.042" offset="3655555">Now, certainly if the police chief of Clarksdale could not recover, police chief of Montgomery should not be able to recover and neither should the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.252" offset="3692335">Now what kind of a rule would it be that respondent here seeks to have this Court adopt that would distinguish between a public official and a public servant on the basis solely as to whether or not he has been delegated by law or statute sovereign power and can exercise it independently as stated in the respondent's brief, page 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.778" offset="3766523">Now, as we read this, according to this, a notary public would meet these requirements under the law of New Hampshire, he'd be a public official but a person with great authority, one who has a subordinate position like an assistant secretary of state might be considered only a public servant.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.827" offset="3842696">Now, many other illustrations might occur to on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.237" offset="3860355">We must not lose sight of the fact that Baer's position as manager was created by statute, 1953, his duties as set forth in the written contract where the Commission is where the approval of the county delegation and the scope of his responsibility was even enlarged by a letter accompanying the contract from the commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.318" offset="3936632">He held the post for nine years as an annual salary and part of the time his contracts were of the terms of one year or two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.983" offset="3963277">A 42 Am. Jur. public officer has about 250 pages, I think, on public office -- public offices and it says in part, and I quote only from the introductory paragraphs, “Public office and public officer are terms of vague and variant import.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.460" offset="4045197">The meaning of which varies with the connection in which they used.Ordinarily and generally, a public officer is defined to be the right or party and duty created and conferred by law, the tenure of which is not transient, occasional or incidental but which for a given period an individual is invested with power to perform a public function for the benefit of the public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.921" offset="4135058">Now, this reference to Am. Jur. will disclose many cases where under various facts and for different purposes courts have construed the words public official or public officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.352" offset="4180825">Now, one can find authority for almost any position, but it is said the duration or tenure need not be fixed so long as not occasional and even with respect to sovereign power the fact that duties are confined in narrow limits is not considered material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.019" offset="4247489">A subordinate or inferior officer is nonetheless an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.857" offset="4262849">Now, few of the positions held to be public office which might be analogous are cited in this treaties, and some of them are officers of public institutions, superintendent of county home, superintendent of state hospital, district maintenance superintendent, deputy superintendent police and many others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.119" offset="4339858">Therefore, we say that Mr. Baer's position seems to satisfy even the very narrow rule which the respondent favors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.855" offset="4374758">Now, certainly, the Supreme Court could not, we believe, have such a narrow definition in mind in New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.408" offset="4400985">Justice Learned Hand in the case of Gregoire and Biddle, just cited in Barr-Matteo and Garrison-Louisiana, commenting upon the problem of how far the privilege of immunity of public officials from suit for statements of defamatory nature should extend states in part as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.168" offset="4472038">The complexities in magnitude of governmental activity had become so great a must of necessity be a delegation and re-delegation of authority as to many functions, and we cannot say that these functions become less important simply because they're exercised by officers of lower rank and the executive in higher rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.987" offset="4555316">Or as Mr. Justice Black said in Barr-Matteo, the effective functioning of a free government like ours depends largely on the force of an informed public opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.848" offset="4594813">This calls for the widest possible understanding of a quality of government service rendered by all official elected or appointed for employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.024" offset="4631489">Such an informed understanding depends of course on the freedom people have to applaud or criticize the way public employees do their jobs from the least to the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.731" offset="4674330">Now, we do not necessarily ask the Court here to adopt a broadened rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.730" offset="4694288">However, the strength in our position, I just like to call your attention to some developments which suggest a broadening of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.939" offset="4727097">Now, as early as 1908, the case of Coleman and MacLennan in Kansas, which is quoted in New York Times and Garrison, stated in such a case the occasion gives rise to the privilege qualified to the extent that any one claiming to be defamed by the communication must show malice or go remediless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.595" offset="4805778">The privilege extends to a great variety of subjects and includes matters of public concern, public men and candidates for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.989" offset="4839320">Analogous reasoning is found in the early affair comment cases cited in Footnote 20 of Justice Brennan's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.172" offset="4868054">It should be noted the rule in restatement of tort, Section 607 in 1938 which reversed a previous graph which would have set forth the New York Times rule says, “Privilege of criticism of so much of another's activities as our matters of public concern includes a privilege to criticize the public conduct of all officers and employees of the United States from this corporation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.170" offset="4976097">Professor Willard Pedrick in an article in Cornell Law Review in the summer of 1964 argues forcefully that New York Times should mean that hereafter the press and all citizens will enjoy a good faith privilege with respect to discussions of matters of public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.641" offset="5041925">Recent cases have applied the rule to a law partner of public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.675" offset="5058121">That's the case cited in New York State, Gilberg and Goffi, to a public commentator, Pearson and Alaska Publishing Company, to a public man recent case in the Western District of Kentucky September 23rd, 1965, Walker against Attorney General and many others.</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.125" offset="6307924">Now here, we are guided by the statement of the rule as set forth in New York Times where Justice Brennan defines the actual malice as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.561" offset="6341569">Unless he proves that the statement was made of actual malice that is with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false, we submit the proof of malice in this case lacks the convincing clarity which the constitutional standard demands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.826" offset="6450657">He -- the court stated malice means ill will, evil motive, intention to injure, want and disregard the rights of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.840" offset="6482735">Malice does not necessarily require ill will or evil motive, although such would constitute malice but malice may consist of the intention of publication of defamatory matter with the reckless disregard of the rights of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.773" offset="6534457">And it may consistently willfully doing an act or willful neglect of an obligation which the right to know is liable to injure another regardless of consequences even though there is no actual intention there to hurt or harm an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.502" offset="6577403">Now, we say this directly contrary to the rule in both Garrison and the Henry cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.720" offset="6606242">Actually the courts charged defines reasonable grounds for belief as the basis on which the privilege is given and said it's a qualified privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.406" offset="6641037">The burden is on the defendant to prove good faith, to prove that the people should know about it, about what he's attempting to say and that they -- that he therefore has the duty to say it and the hopes they'll take some action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.655" offset="6690043">Well, any way, if the Court examines the charge, I think you will find there are many places that indicate there's not in cons with the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.951" offset="6723166">Furthermore, the statements for malice were given only at the end of the charge and had to do only with the question of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.946" offset="6747199">So that we say that the burden was unconstitutionally placed upon the defendant in the case to prove good faith, which was another way of saying prove lack of malice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley M. Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="1931.125" offset="7827832">If it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.429" offset="7837132">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, I propose to use my time on two questions only of those that have been briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.365" offset="7872867">First one will be our view of the correct answer to the question we were specifically invited to argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.638" offset="7905886">That is whether or not Baer was or was not a public official at the time of this libel or previously when he hasn't employed by the council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.136" offset="7939950">The second question to which I desire to invite the attention of the Court is the question whether a lawful occasion is a matter which properly under our jurisprudence, a court should determine to exist or not to exist or whether it involves in the usual case and in this case, questions of fact which necessarily must be determined by the jury or whatever part of our system finds fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.983" offset="8055306">Now, before I get into it, I want to if I may just for a moment, get into what the facts of this case were because it's quite apparent to me since it's only one copy of the record down here that the Court has not had the ability as yet to get those facts in line and they are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.428" offset="8117060">My client Fritzy Baer was hired in 1950 on a contract which was terminable at any time on two weeks notice by the county commissioners who hired him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.128" offset="8163871">At page 6 of our brief, the salient points of that contract are set forth and that contract is specific that no sovereign powers are delegated by the county commissioners to Baer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.317" offset="8220609">It is specific that regardless of how broad the language is giving him his duties, the powers are withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.238" offset="8256345">That was in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.355" offset="8260838">Now, at that time the county had statutory authority to hire a supervisor for recreational area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.279" offset="8288528">So that the contract was executed in accordance with the statute, but the statute is bare of any delineation of duties of powers, gives no tenure at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.005" offset="8335444">And in 1953, the only change was made was to require that the county commissioners secure the approval of the county delegation, their superiors in the public official hierarchy before they negotiated a contract but it is still set out specifically that this is a job to be negotiated on an employment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.882" offset="8418931">Now, the second contract is made as of 1955, the man is on a week to week hiring subject to two weeks notice of termination either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.971" offset="8459264">That was his employment from then until July of 1959 and he was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.007" offset="8483401">He was given his two weeks notice and let go in the notice in June, he's let go in July, this is six months before the libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.858" offset="8522794">There was no legislative rowel going on at the time of this libel at all, the legislature only meets in New Hampshire every other year and this is a none legislative year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.122" offset="8559888">That's the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.282" offset="8564485">Now factually this -- in this record and this is absolutely clear and there's no argument about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.270" offset="8588413">There was one individual only who had the responsibility for and actually handled cash from its being picked up at the till, at the ski lifts and the ski shop and the restaurant took that long and counted it, made a deposit slip and put it in the bank to the credit of the county and that man was Fritzy Baer, and all of the people in this county who skied who were up there knew that that was the job he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.606" offset="8689768">One thing he did in his hand, in his hand went every dollar of $200,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.501" offset="8721324">And he was accounting part by putting it in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.432" offset="8733132">He had no authority to draw a check.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.762" offset="8742431">He had no authority to buy 5 cents worth of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.531" offset="8757478">All of the controls were exercised by the county commissioners, they made all the decisions, except for one thing, that the handling of cash was Fritzy Baer all the way from the turning of the $200,000 to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.778" offset="8810454">Now, when this man comes out and says falsely that the income at that area is literally, and he meant it, literally hundreds of percent better under this new management than it was last year and the previous years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.666" offset="8866043">And then he says this may only makes bit require that you pondered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.048" offset="8883597">What happened to all the money last year?</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.008" offset="8891434">What's he talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.810" offset="8898644">This is not a case that was tried on presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.559" offset="8909615">Read the record, this went through that community like wild fire and the meaning was clearly understood by everybody that Rosenblatt was raising the insinuation that Baer had been stealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.536" offset="8973563">He had been dipping in the tilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.951" offset="8979205">There's no other explanation for the language used under these circumstances and there's a prior history of two years of sniping by Rosenblatt of Baer questioning who handles the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.275" offset="9036466">Who makes the deposit?</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.856" offset="9046810">Who does this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.389" offset="9048900">Why won't Fritzy Baer answer these questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.290" offset="9056528">This was in public print.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.023" offset="9063424">All the answers were given to him privately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.488" offset="9073351">He acknowledged privately that he had the answers, but he continued to ask the question public, why won't Fritzy Baer answer these questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.557" offset="9101563">Well, the reason Fritzy couldn't answer them was that this being a function of a manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.964" offset="9123192">The county commissioners told him don't, instructed him not to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.233" offset="9140328">He had no authority to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.223" offset="9148270">In the public debate about the money, the commissioners exercised their prerogatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.530" offset="9169481">Now that's --</text>

            <text syncTime="2270.533" offset="9185468">Because when this man raised these questions, the county commissioners immediately sent word to him at his store in Laconia, he owns two, that if he wanted those facts, all he had to do was to go down to the end of the street, it's perhaps 700 yards and all of the answers to all of his questions were a matter of public record at the courthouse and he was welcome to come in and they'd all be made available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.847" offset="9282748">He eventually did, take him up on it and he did acknowledge at a budget hearing that with those records, after he took the title and got them all of his questions had been answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.938" offset="9327156">He never told the general public that his -- his questions had been answered but he acknowledged in fact they were.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.497" offset="9417331">$31,500 and there is specific evidence of lost job opportunities and lost earnings totaling $16,500 on special damages alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.878" offset="9478875">That is detailed in the Supreme Court decision as well as in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.886" offset="9498937">Now getting to the question, I say this, going to Times and Sullivan public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.075" offset="9531643">This Court invited our argument as to whether this man is a public official or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.254" offset="9548361">I think it is noteworthy that there isn't a single citation of authority in my brother's brief or in the amicus brief as to what does and what does not constitute being a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.855" offset="9590784">Now, there is a large body of law on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.447" offset="9605204">And it is generally held throughout all jurisdictions including this one that there are two at least essential elements to being a public officer or holding a public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.332" offset="9652746">Some delegation of the sovereignty of the political body for whom you act, and some delineation in the law of what those duties are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.223" offset="9708231">Now, if this Court is going to stay with the Sullivan rule, it seems to me that those of us who work down below in the trial pit or on the courts of the rest of these jurisdictions, we have a right to have that rule made a legal rule rather than a factual rule to be applied as we come here with every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.134" offset="9791927">And I think this Court has two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.727" offset="9806242">You can say in each individual case we're going to review what the actual duties or demand in office in his performance of whatever he's doing, what he's actually doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.860" offset="9846784">That's factually, and that means that some judge at pre-trial or when the case goes to the jury is going to have -- had to have a factual determination made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.401" offset="9896939">The other way to do it is the way we suggest in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.255" offset="9912404">If a public office is one where there must be a delegation of some type of sovereignty to be exercised by the man independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.036" offset="9947512">If he looks for his authority to the statute, which is what the general law is in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.200" offset="9972172">Then when you come into court, whether you are a public official or not can be determined as a matter of law by reference to the law where the law should be in the books, rather than by a parade of witnesses as to whether he's digging ditches or doing something else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.345" offset="12012753">It was absolute -- there's no litigation on it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.930" offset="12027068">We were trying the case before Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.647" offset="12037935">Now, the other -- the other point, if I may for a moment that I'd like to invite to the attention of the Court is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.627" offset="12073880">In Sullivan and in Garrison, and I think inferentially in the Henry cases, this Court seems to indicate that a privilege, the existence of a privilege as being disposed of in this Court at least, are on a legal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.573" offset="12149635">That is that that is something that is decided legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.751" offset="12166353">I have reviewed the authorities -- the state authorities and I think all of the authorities of this Court on this proposition and I find no support generally for the proposition that it is a legal matter whether or not a particular writing is privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.010" offset="12231450">Now, in my state, we have responsible authority going back over the years if that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.050" offset="12267604">Privilege, lawful occasion are not legal matters as much as they are factual in the ordinary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.531" offset="12301458">There may be cases where they become legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.300" offset="12312534">What I'm talking about is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.457" offset="12317236">The fact that something is published on the Fourth of July does not necessarily prove it as privilege, and if we're right, if you have something more in that concept, it seems to me that this Court should perhaps explain a little bit more for those of us who are trying to protect the rights of litigants in this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.084" offset="12403754">What is and what is not within that concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.602" offset="12413785">Now, in New Hampshire, our rule is that a writing must be for a proper purpose done in good faith and based upon a reasonable belief in the truth of what's being written, talking to factual situation rather than the comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.571" offset="12485674">That is not -- that concept is not the malice concept that is lack of reasonable -- reasonable belief may be some evidence of malice but even in New Hampshire we don't say that they're the equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.274" offset="12536456">But if you're trying a case that you say is a libel and it's a malicious libel, I am the plaintiff and the defendant comes in and he says he has a qualified privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.923" offset="12579088">By all of the authorities that I know of except possibly Arizona, the fellow taking the position he has that privilege has the burden of proving his own good faith, a justifiable purpose of the writing and that what he wrote in the factual area was based upon at least some investigation sufficient to support a reasonable belief in the act of substantial accuracy of what is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.195" offset="12692146">Now, this Court's handling of the Henry cases seems to indicate that those concepts have no part of libel, if privileges claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.127" offset="12735927">Now, if that is so, it seems to me where we should be advised specifically that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.469" offset="12757243">Now, if the Court is not taking that position, if the Court is content as the Court appeared in its Footnote 20 to be in Sullivan to go along with the state's version, state law version in the field of libel, those elements are still part of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.402" offset="12848985">In New Hampshire, it's our view that whether something is written for a proper purpose or whether it's written maliciously, our questions are fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.640" offset="12889945">Whether something was written for justifiable purpose or not is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.040" offset="12915545">Whether items that are factual, whether they were based upon reasonable belief in what they were written or whether they're not are questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.180" offset="12968103">We don't -- we don't say in my state that those questions are to be determined as a matter of law by some judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.341" offset="12992763">If this Court is going to that extent, I think it should be said plainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.903" offset="13018990">Now, this I think completes the circle back to the (Inaudible) trial where the quarrel with the government was that the government insisted it decided what law is libel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.370" offset="13236851">No, we never went that far Judge Black, but it's curious to me that in attempting to evolve the present concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.412" offset="13276975">This Court have almost I think announced a rule where the Court is going to decide as a matter of law that privilege does exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.580" offset="13321697">Now, the other side of that coin, if you decide as a matter of law that privilege does exist, it's also capable of legal determination that the privilege does not exist and that therefore there was a libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.435" offset="13373106">Now, that is the concept that causes this Court was enunciating and applying in the Sander case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.081" offset="13415737">And the Sander case freed the press in this country by turning these factual issues and the factual issues are what are the intention, the purpose, the good faith, the malice or the non-malice in this -- in this type of case turn that or as a function for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.537" offset="13481566">Now, we've been over the years quite proud, of our handling of -- of this type of thing in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.933" offset="13507062">I think it's unfortunate that one area of the country today is exhibiting uncontrolled actions in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.353" offset="13540812">By -- I hesitate to think that the rest of us in other areas of the country must loose the rather salutary function of the jury in this type of case out of deference to another situation its not of our making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.764" offset="13590444">And it does seem to me that the Court shouldn't reestablish as a part of the constitutional concept that lawful occasion does connotate a publication in good faith for a justifiable purpose based upon either reasonable investigation of the factual information or at least the reasonable belief in substantial accuracy of what is being suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.111" offset="13691800">Now, the other items in my -- in our case, I am content to leave on the brief unless there would have other questions.</text>
