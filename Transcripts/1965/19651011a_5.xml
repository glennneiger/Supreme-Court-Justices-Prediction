            <text syncTime="37.834" offset="254725">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.269" offset="268413">The petitioner in this case, Reverend Fred L. Shuttlesworth, a Negro Minister and well known Civil Rights leader in Birmingham, Alabama was arrested by four or five police officers at 10:30 in the morning on Wednesday, April 04, 1962, for loitering and failing to obey the orders of a policeman on a corner in Downtown Birmingham, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.716" offset="394219">Shuttlesworth was convicted in the Recorder's Court, and again convicted after a trial de novo in the Circuit Court and was sentenced to 180 days hard labor, six months, and an additional 61 days hard labor in default of a fine in courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.045" offset="483558">This Court granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Alabama Court of Appeals, which affirmed the conviction, rejecting petitioner's federal constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.061" offset="531623">Now I would state the facts in some detail.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.975" offset="579271">The limit I think for all misdemeanors under the code is six months and a $100 fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.360" offset="624828">The maximum that you could get for one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.609" offset="649801">Now, I would state the facts in some detail, because they are I think important to an appreciation of petitioner's arguments that the Birmingham's laws were unconstitutionally vague as applied to him that there was no evidence to support the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.513" offset="717406">Now the testimony in the record is in sharp conflict, but I will relate the police version referring only slightly at the beginning of the certain uncontradicted defense testimony about matters prior to the actual arrest incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.453" offset="793161">The defense version of the facts was totally irreconcilable with the policeman's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.771" offset="818448">The defense claim was that the police case was a complete fabrication, an attempt to -- the arrest was an harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.881" offset="850944">Now Shuttlesworth and his companion, Reverend James Phifer, were arrested shortly after they left the Federal District Court in Birmingham, where they were engaged in litigating a prior disorderly conduct prosecution after a remand from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.841" offset="934745">The two ministers had been jailed for over a month, this record reveals, early in 1962 and on February 26, this Court remanded the case to the Federal District Court with an order which resulted in Shuttlesworth's eventual release.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.058" offset="1003604">Now these proceedings, this record indicates, were a widely publicized headlines story in the local papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.098" offset="1039757">And there is no dispute that Shuttlesworth was well known in Birmingham for Civil Rights activities and well known by the Police Department, which had arrested him on a variety of occasions in connection with Civil Rights activities, some of the arresting officers testified, they knew about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.141" offset="1111960">Now on April 04, 1962, after leaving the Federal Court, which is located at 5th Avenue in 19th Street in Birmingham, Shuttlesworth and Phifer, followed by four other Negro men, walking down 19th street from 5th Avenue towards 2nd Avenue, the heart of the Birmingham's Downtown shopping center area, about 10:30 in the morning into the business district, and this morning there were very few Negroes on the streets in Downtown Birmingham, because the Negroes were boycotting the Downtown stores and there is testimony that this group was conspicuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.701" offset="1294190">Now the group attracted to the attention of the police officer Robert Byars who was the traffic officer assigned to 3rd Avenue in 19th, but wasn't at his post, he was half a block away, standing on 19th Street by an alley.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.516" offset="1361481">Byars said he saw this group walking down the street, they weren't doing anything, weren't violating any laws, just walking South towards 2nd Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.744" offset="1398366">At this point, Byars entered a store, which sits on the corner of 2nd and 19th and runs -- the alley entrance to this store, Newberry's Department Store and followed the petitioner's path by Byars going through to the store, and he followed parallel to their path, reaching -- the petitioners and Byars reaching the corner of 2nd Avenue in 19th street.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.154" offset="1535979">When officer Byars got to the corner, he says that he stood inside looking out through the glass door, and by now the group which he said was 5 or 6 people had reached 10 or 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.829" offset="1602644">And he saw 10 or 12 persons all congregated on the corner, he said standing and listening and talking, that Shuttlesworth was among them and the group was just standing and talking mostly to Shuttlesworth, it was in Byars words, doing quite a bit of talking himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.288" offset="1676518">Policeman Byars says incidentally that he didn't know Shuttlesworth, although he acknowledged he had seen him on television, seen his photograph and read about him in the papers and he also heard about this boycott.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="407.849" offset="1734719">He didn't know him or didn't recognize him or both?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="410.503" stopTime="633.578">
            <label>Mr. James M. Nabrit, III</label>
            <text syncTime="410.503" offset="1745377">He says both, he said he didn't know – said seen him on television.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.418" offset="1777037">Byars also maintained that he didn't even know the race of this group on the corner, he didn't notice it in the trial, he didn't know what race this group was, although, several other officers testified they were all Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.304" offset="1828551">Anyway Byars states that he stood inside the door watching the group for a minute to a minute-and-a-half, and then stepped outside and told the group to move on and clear the sidewalk and not obstruct it for pedestrians.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.731" offset="1902320">He said some, but not all the group began to move, so he repeated his order and then Shuttlesworth asked him, “You mean to say, we can't stand here on the sidewalk?”</text>
            <text syncTime="462.027" offset="1951431">At this point, three more officers, two on motorcycles, arrived on the corner and a fourth was approaching on foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.297" offset="1996570">Officers Homer and Davis, who were on another corner of the intersection were beckoned over by Byars.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.753" offset="2030425">Rensheur came up on his motorcycle and patrolman Allred who was assigned to a corner about two blocks away arrived -- began to approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.423" offset="2073057">After Shuttlesworth asked this question, Byars says he didn't answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.291" offset="2092492">He just hesitated for what he called a short time and said that was for the third and last time he was informing them they would have to move and clear the sidewalk or else they would be arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.111" offset="2139826">By now, according to the officers, Byars included, everyone except Shuttlesworth was moving away and had dispersed and at this point, Shuttlesworth asked Byars a second question, which Byars told two versions of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.428" offset="2213073">On page 18 of the record, Byars says, Shuttlesworth's second question was, “Do you mean to tell me, we can't stand here in the front of this store.”</text>
            <text syncTime="544.823" offset="2282663">Over on page 20, still on direct examination, Byars says that Shuttlesworth's second question was, “Do you mean to tell we can't go into the store.”</text>
            <text syncTime="556.500" offset="2329370">In any event, whatever happened at this point, Byars without answering told Shuttlesworth he was under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.762" offset="2370435">Byars says, Shuttlesworth said, “Well I will go into the store” and started into Newberry's Department Store where Byars pursued him inside the door, took him by the arm, and told him he was under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.309" offset="2420590">Now Shuttlesworth didn't resist.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.814" offset="2434591">He was a docile prisoner and gave no trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.799" offset="2454549">By Byars estimate, the whole episode by the time he stepped out and first confronted the group till he arrested Shuttlesworth in the store, consumed a minute and to a minute-and-a-half, a minute to a minute-and-a-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.687" offset="2518079">A few minutes later, patrolman Byars was though, a few minutes later, he arrested Reverend Phifer.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.424" offset="2541066">He arrested Reverend Phifer, because Phifer persisted in talking to Shuttlesworth who was under arrest waiting to be carried away in a patrol car and Byars took it as unlawful for somebody to talk to his prisoner over his objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.660" offset="2601984">Phifer incidentally was tried and convicted on the same record with Shuttlesworth, but his conviction was overturned on appeal in the State Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.625" offset="2881912">The officer's testimony about where this group was standing on the corner and how much of it all they blocked the pedestrians, it was confusing to say the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.887" offset="2934888">Byars said this group 10:30 in the morning was blocking half of the sidewalk causing the people walking east and west either have to wait for -- they causing -- the people walking east, either have to wait for people walking west to get out of their way or step into the side of the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.546" offset="3009599">However, on cross examination Byars slightly contradicted himself and said that the East-West crosswalk wasn't blocked at all, that they were only occupying half of the North-South crosswalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.582" offset="3061739">In any event, the very pertinent thing I think is that the officer who was in charge of the traffic at this intersection, officer Holman, an experienced officer of 14 years, I think on the force, had been standing on this corner directing traffic for an hour before all this started.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.103" offset="3139793">And Holman saw this group before Byars was there and didn't pay any attention, listen to his testimony at page 62, at the bottom of page 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.182" offset="3188067">Question - now you observe on these corners from your position here when you tried to police that corner, do you not?</text>

            <text syncTime="781.280" offset="3228505">And you seen these people over there blocking traffic before you saw officer Byars?</text>
            <text syncTime="786.385" offset="3248880">I saw him standing over there talking to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.678" offset="3262046">Question - did you see them before he was talking to them?</text>
            <text syncTime="792.970" offset="3275212">Answer - I saw them over there, I didn't pay any particular attention to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.355" offset="3296841">Question - did you get the impression they were waiting for the light to change?</text>
            <text syncTime="802.087" offset="3311679">Answer - I couldn't answer that, because I don't know what they had on their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.936" offset="3331114">Question - you formed no impression when you first saw them?</text>
            <text syncTime="831.529" offset="3429439">Answer - no.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.261" offset="3429334">You took no note of them when you first saw them, is that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="815.520" offset="3429230">Answer - I just saw them standing over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.661" offset="3429125">Question - the only time you may note of them standing over there, was when you saw the policeman assisting you talking to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.120" offset="3429021">Answer - when I saw him over there talking to them, he wasn't assisting me.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.171" offset="3428916">He wasn't assisting you with your corner?</text>
            <text syncTime="833.193" offset="3436126">So, whatever obstruction or whatever impairment to pedestrian traffic had to have been slight, the officer was directing traffic on this corner didn't pay any attention to these people certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.678" offset="3482102">In any event, Byars' own version I think demonstrates that this brief confrontation -- that during this brief confrontation with Shuttlesworth, a minute to a minute-and-a half, all Shuttlesworth did was ask Byars questions, as the group Byars objected to dispersed.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.651" offset="3561932">Now, about whether Byars really meant he couldn't stand in front of the store or go into the store, whichever version of Byars story you believe, and where he could stand and what he could do, that would really suit officer Byars.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.936" offset="3619088">Now the State Court as I said, credited the police -- one of the police version of the facts and there was nothing in the defense testimony of Byars -- of Shuttlesworth, Phifer and four other witnesses, nothing in their testimony that was it all helpful to the States' case.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.248" offset="3704351">Their description of the events, which I will just summarize in a sentence or two, was that it can't possibly be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.617" offset="3737788">They denied being a part of any group of 10 or 12, they denied standing on a corner, they said they merely slowed, they were waiting for the light, when Byars came out of Newberry's and stood in front of Shuttlesworth blocking his path, telling him to move on and Shuttlesworth said, “Move where?”</text>
            <text syncTime="924.888" offset="3802885">Byars said, “Move anywhere” and Shuttlesworth said, “He was going to the store”, Byars immediately arrested him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.241" offset="8432306">So, I think there is definitely a First Amendment aspect to the matter, that just standing on the street Shuttlesworth did embody the civil rights movement in Birmingham, but there was a First Amendment situation even on the States' version of the facts, because the police version was Shuttlesworth standing in amidst of a group of 12 people, the center of the conversation talking to them and talking to him and Shuttlesworth denied this, but accepting the states' version that Shuttlesworth was standing amidst -- gathered this crowd and he was talking to them, we have a person exercising First Amendment rights in a simple form, but nevertheless in an important and constitutionally protected manner, because to communicate with a small group of people is just as much First Amendment activity as to make the speech or distribute hand bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.691" offset="8718085">Now, referring the Court to Section 1142 set out on page two and three of our brief, one of the complaint was framed on the second paragraph of 1142, so if we could turn directly to that, its in two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.816" offset="8826650">The first one makes it unlawful, for any person or any number of persons to so stand or loiter or walk upon any street or sidewalk in the city, as to obstruct free passage over on the longer sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.705" offset="8890180">And then the second sentence says, it shall also be an unlawful and note the word also, to be also unlawful for any person to stand or loiter upon any street or sidewalk of the city after having been requested by any police officer to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.567" offset="8961651">We have two alternative ways, on the face of it at least, two alternative ways of committing the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.892" offset="8990908">The first being to stand or loiter so as to obstruct free passage and the second alternative being, to stand or loiter after having been requested to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.175" offset="9044093">The complaint against Shuttlesworth was disjunctive just like the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.342" offset="9068753">The complaint, page two and three of the record, the charge is exactly in the words of the statute, that Shuttlesworth did stand or loiter or walk upon a street or sidewalk within and among of group of other persons, so as to obstruct free passage, and then naming the intersection or did, or did while the said groups stand or loiter upon say a street or sidewalk after having been requested by a police officer to move on, they are both contrary to Section 1142.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.771" offset="9234474">The time of Shuttlesworth's arrest, there had been no construction or interpretation of this law, no judicial gloss put on it whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.470" offset="9281285">Shuttlesworth took the law as it was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.506" offset="9293406">And as it was written, certainly the second sentence, the second alternative, the part dealing with standing or loitering after police officer has requested you to move on is unconstitutionally vague, because it puts the citizens right to be on the street, no matter what he is doing in the complete control of the policemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.625" offset="9389850">It contains no guidance for the citizen, the policemen, the trier of the fact, anyone and even more invidiously perhaps the law by precluding the citizen from standing long enough to question the policemen about what his order means or ask him about it, makes it impossible for the citizen to stand there even long enough to judge, whether the officer is justified in giving the order lest he be found guilty of loitering after the request to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.901" offset="9534986">We submit that after this last aspect, this law really failed to warn Shuttlesworth, and really standing for a moment and asking an officer whether he really meant that he couldn't stand in front of the store would constitute punishable loitering, after an order to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.796" offset="9618578">I submit that 1142 is unconstitutionally vague for all of the reasons this Court is ever given in vagueness cases for invalidating laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.538" offset="9673540">There is the lack of fair warning, there is the lack of guidance to the administrator, the executive officer, the policemen and the trier of the fact and in addition to that, this law if any law does, is completely susceptible of arbitrary and discriminatory applications.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.427" offset="10309047">The Court -- the majority opinion stated, that even where vague statutes are concerned, it has been pointed out that the vice in such on any enactment cannot be cured in a given case by a construction in that very case, placing valid limits on the statute, for the objection of vagueness is two-fold; inadequate guidance to the individual whose conduct is regulated and adequate guidance to the triers of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.038" offset="10427538">The former objection could not be cured retrospectively by a ruling either of the Trial Court or the Appellate Court, though it might be cured for the future by an Authoritarian Judicial Class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.461" offset="10485217">But beyond even this, really the -- this Middlebrooks doctrine that -- that twists the words of the statute to make it -- to make it now mean something different, to make it now meaning that the policeman can't just order any citizen off, the policeman can only give the order if there is a prior obstruction, is it really what it says, because the [Inaudible] with the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.566" offset="10617605">The Alabama Court has construed this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.913" offset="10639026">It says that the police make out a prima facie case that there was an obstruction by merely proving that the policeman gave the order and that the burden is on the defender to come in and show that the policeman's order was arbitrary, citing this New York case, People against [Inaudible].</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.626" offset="12409919">I think I would like to correct some of the implications of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.333" offset="12460701">Here is a statement on I think Mr. Narbit referred to on cross examination relating to what the two defendants Phifer and Shuttlesworth were doing and whether or not they alone were blocking the sidewalk in such a manner as to require the pedestrians to go out into the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.554" offset="12561638">It is true enough at Page 21, I believe on top of Page 22 of the record, that they all – so testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.260" offset="12600404">However, on further cross examination on Page 27 and Page 28 of the record, he was interrogated further about the crowd and he said the crowd of which the bottom of Page 27 and the top Page 28, he said the crowd of which Mr. Shuttlesworth, Reverend Shuttlesworth and Reverend Phifer were members did block the East-West traffic lane for pedestrians and did as a point of fact require the pedestrians who were not involved in the group to move into the street in order to get by.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.850" offset="12790784">Now, it is true the testimony is that they did not block over half of that passageway, but nevertheless at that particular hour, a busy hour of the morning, when the testimony shows that from 50 to 100 people a minute were passing by.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.615" offset="12861837">The testimony clearly shows and this -- the Court of Appeals clearly had the right to determine as a matter of fact that the pedestrian traffic was so diverted as to get into the street, and it is obviously the inference to be drawn from that evidence that it did interfere in that manner with the vehicular traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.173" offset="12952116">Now, we -- I think we have in our brief, the Phifer -- the relevant portions of the Phifer case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4274.433" offset="17201089">As a matter of fact in the brief, I believe that the petitioners say that that they have in effect that they -- that they realize that it has been so narrowly construed as to relate to those situations involving or relating to vehicular traffic that they had no desire to argue further about the unconstitutionality of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.720" offset="17306206">They said if it had not been so construed, then they would then contend it had the same infirmities as they say 1142 had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.457" offset="17349151">But the Court of Appeals in both cases found that they did not reach the constitutionality of 1231, and petitioner's brief concedes that to be the case and closes that little quotation in that regard with a statement that it's immaterial anyway whether it is – whether it is good or bad or whether it did reach and didn't reach it because of the 1142 is the dispositive of this particular case, and so we say that the Court of Appeals did not reach the question of constitutionality of the 1231.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.326" offset="17536711">We do not mean to concede that it would have been unconstitutional had they've reached it, but they did say that it related to vehicular traffic and as such in a later case, the Shelton case, I believe some of the court felt that in vehicular traffic situations, there should be some assumption in favor of the validity of the direction of the traffic officer or the police officer and that it should not be set apart or aside or reversed unless there was some evidence presented to show that they obstruct arbitrarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="4481.964" offset="18031261">Now, we say first that there is no lack of evidence because it is obvious that the Court of Appeals took the position that evidence of forcing pedestrians into the street made of this situation a matter involving vehicular traffic.</text>

            <text syncTime="6138.449" offset="24657168">As we understand it, the Court of Appeals in this case said that 1142 applies not in freedom of the speech cases, but has its application only in, in the matter related to the blocking of the sidewalk or traffic situation in relation to sidewalks and streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6173.007" offset="24795408">And on page 17 of our brief, we do quote the holding of the Court of Appeals or the reference by the Court of Appeals to Section 1142 as amended that [Inaudible] city code which states that it is not aimed at free speech and simply it is a municipal regulation, which is confined to the controller traffic and use of streets and sidewalks.</text>

            <text syncTime="6247.524" offset="25093517">Reverend Shuttlesworth testified in the case and he said that he didn't recognize officer Byars, he did not know officer Byars.</text>

            <text syncTime="6933.558" offset="27837628">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6936.861" offset="27850794">May I say at the outset, the petitioner objected pretrial to the constitutionality of Section 1231 in the very same terms, he objected to the constitutionality of Section 1142 and it's all on page six of the demurrer and also exactly the same way page four and the motion to quash.</text>
            <text syncTime="6965.151" offset="27963956">This last case of Shuttlesworth in this Court involved a similar sort of an attempt to prevent this Court from reaching the federal issue that would involved the wrong side of the paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="6980.687" offset="28026128">Well, this esoteric procedural rule, that a pleading that is labeled separate even though, it is nevertheless called joined and therefore improper is I submit, requires a meaningless ritual like this Court talked about in Staub against Baxley where the man had to write in separate sentences, I object to the constitutionality of this law and that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7012.567" offset="28153605">Under -- but it is plain that the petitioner presented his constitutional objection to both statues and ample time for the Court to rule on them, to understand his objection very plainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.515" offset="28205432">Now, I don't propose to devote much more time to a mystery of what he was convicted about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7038.192" offset="28256110">It seemed to me clear that the Court can't note that the prosecutor convicted him doesn't seem to know at this point, but I think both charges were constitutionally vulnerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7054.509" offset="28321416">Section 1142, it is so obviously capable of sweeping and discriminatory application that if such a law as this were upheld, no civil rights worker could ever safely venture on the streets in a community where the police were disposed to suppress civil rights activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7080.814" offset="28426637">The threat of serious penalties, here eight months in jail serves as deterrent to coerce to obey lawless police orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="7095.963" offset="28487241">As for example, police orders of a type in right against Georgia that is specifically designed to enforce segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.118" offset="28523813">And this one is obviously capable of application to First Amendment situation, to every kind of First Amendment situation on the streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="7114.058" offset="28559653">It makes the policemen the dictator of the streets without any possibility of a effective review by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7123.987" offset="28599359">The very fact that under this Court's usual practice, the facts escapes strict review, demonstrates the necessity for a really strict standard of the statutory specificity with a law so easily susceptible of abuse and use to suppress free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="7144.211" offset="28680234">I would point out however, that this Court's decisions in Edwards against South Carolina and Cox against Louisiana last term make a claim that the Court has the power and duty to scrutinize the record, that the fact should be taken as they appear in the record consistent with the findings by the Alabama Court of Appeals, but not limited to that Court's characterizations of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="7175.475" offset="28805308">Now, I believe that the Chief Justice asked Mr. McBee how wide the sidewalks are and he correctly responded that there is no evidence of the width of the sidewalks in the record and I understand he gave his own estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7193.556" offset="28877615">It is my understanding that his estimate is right, about 12 feet as to the second avenue side, by the 19th street sidewalk is very wide about, 20 feet wide.</text>
