            <text syncTime="203.135" offset="917985">The sheriff had testified below that up until that moment, he had never observed any Negroes enter the -- this library which is part of a three Parish system involving three buildings and two bookmobiles.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.899" offset="1196972">The testimony also indicated that if a White person had come to the blue -- blue bookmobile, that is the one for Negroes, such a person was refer either to the red bookmobile, that is for Whites or to one of the branches.</text>

            <text syncTime="595.157" offset="2486063">Yes, on 112 when -- on cross-examination of the administrative head of the library, Mrs. Perkins, the question was, I asked her in form of a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.836" offset="2540816">I'll show you what purports to be a postcard of the United States postal service addressed -- I'll skip a few words to Henry Brown, Jackson, Louisiana which reads “Memo to Henry Brown from the Audubon Regional Library, bookmobile number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.680" offset="2604136">We are mailing to you on the separate cover the copy of Arna Bontemps: The Story of the Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.659" offset="2632035">And then, neither the Audubon nor the state library could verify such a title by Wendall.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.387" offset="2658994">You -- you may return the book either by mail or to the book -- the blue bookmobile whichever way is most convenient.”</text>
            <text syncTime="646.503" offset="2691385">I suggest though, I don't think it's significant that this was just a confusion over the correct name of the author.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.560" offset="2715627">In any event as I've indicated and as the record shows, the choice of return was not in person to the library but either to the blue -- blue bookmobile, the Negro bookmobile or to the -- through the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.411" offset="2771111">In any event, at this point, Mrs. Reeves wasn't certain whether Brown asked to see the United States constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="752.436" offset="3115196">Well, there was some question as to whether they have – they had asked to see the United States constitution because the sheriff later testified that when he, at the time he asked them to leave, Brown and one of the others who was not identified by the sheriff said they wanted service and the sheriff refers specifically to the fact that there was a request discussion about the United States Constitution and as a matter of fact, the librarian herself when she -- that is the administrative head of the library, when she testified after Mrs. Reeves, she also testified there was discussion about the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.924" offset="3273080">So that when I answered your question, it was not meant to be a base of it but merely that there was further discussion unquestionably and -- but there wasn't -- sir, I can't honestly say that she refused to permit them to see the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.594" offset="5067797">Her testimony begins at 136 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.646" offset="5087963">And she, for example, in the middle of 137, questioned, what procedure is adopted in registering a person for books?</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.394" offset="5127043">Well we issued a card to a person who filled the required information out and the card stamp with the word “Negro” and the date.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.238" offset="5325051">Answer - On 138, well the only persons who use the blue bookmobile is Negroes and the blue bookmobile serves the three parishes for all Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.963" offset="5324946">And occasionally if a White person would come to the blue bookmobile, I would give them a schedule telling them when the red bookmobile would come or the nearest branch to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.252" offset="7366468">Well, in the case really, it does not stand on this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.706" offset="7380261">All I would hope that this Court would lay that proposition to rest particularly in light of its decision in Shuttlesworth which is not identical with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.750" offset="7416414">It has many overlapping observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.471" offset="7435327">For example in Galbert the opening indication was that there was an actual obstruction of the street unhappy that there had been many people congregating on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.906" offset="7477018">In other words, the presupposition of facts in Galprin was that the speed was obstructed and the police officer therefore asked everybody to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.541" offset="7507634">And in fact Judge Lehman there made it very clear when he said the police officers are not the final arbiters of the rights of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.187" offset="7542220">So that for reasons that we have set forth specifically in our brief, we urge that this is -- the connection must be reversed that the interpretation of the statute by Louisiana is an unconstitutional interpretation, it is hopefully broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.408" offset="7611079">It does advice citizens of how to perform under this Act any event the Act was -- as Judge Harlan was suggesting was perhaps that the First Amendment right that we think ought to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.188" offset="7662174">And lastly our argument -- next, our argument is that the -- that the -- there was a -- we think there is any statement here under the Title 3 of the Civil Rights Act because the Title III was passed several months -- and that the Act was passed several months after the arrest here and Title III made it very clear that these -- that such -- we think that such kind of this was legal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.945" offset="7769172">And therefore any statute which made it illegal was improper.</text>

            <text syncTime="3185.295" offset="12846644">And that was to establish racial equality in your -- and your court in this finding on 140 -- page 140 says clearly the evidence shows that these parties did not congregate when they came to the town of Clinton, to the Audubon Parish Library merely for the purpose of seeking service and that they had a specific motive and a specific intent, and that was as were shown beyond any reasonable doubt to refuse to leave the library even after they had -- had been served and after they'd been requested to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.348" offset="13002856">Now doesn't that -- doesn't that make the case turn on a racial question?</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.170" offset="13038070">I believe anybody who'd acted that way would -- would receive the same thing.</text>
