            <text syncTime="32.970" offset="235290">Mr. Schofield, you may proceed with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Schofield</label>
            <text syncTime="36.645" offset="249919">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.220" offset="264234">Petitioner, James T. Stevens, was a lieutenant with the New York City Police Department prior to a summary discharge on July 15th, 1964 asserting his constitutional privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.566" offset="317628">Stevens had been a member of that department for 18 years and only needed two more years for retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.230" offset="344273">On a morning of June 26, Stevens together with other police officers with summons in the police headquarters and at an office of the deputy chief inspector, they were all handed forthwith subpoenas to appear before the New York County grand jury standing there or sitting some three blocks away.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.125" offset="423894">A superior officer was assigned to accompany these men to that grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.936" offset="447091">When they arrived there at, they were met by an assistant district attorney who told them, he wished their testimony in the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.391" offset="480946">However, he told them before they would be permitted to enter that grand jury they must sign a waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.004" offset="515427">He stated this was a requirement that the state constitution and the city charter required of each of these men if they wished to stay on the police force.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.197" offset="560149">He reminded them that on a day pervious, ten police officers were summarily dismissed for failure to sign up a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.104" offset="595780">He also told them at that time, they had a constitutional privilege not to incriminate themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.666" offset="622007">However, Stevens saw fit to sign that waiver of immunity on the advice of the Assistant District Attorney without having any private counsel to advise him.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.075" offset="659623">Stevens went into that grand jury --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="141.502" stopTime="143.588">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="141.502" offset="669341">He -- did he ask for a (Inaudible)</text>

          <turn speaker="john_p_schofield" startTime="143.588" stopTime="506.865">
            <label>Mr. John P. Schofield</label>
            <text syncTime="143.588" offset="677700">No, Stevens didn't but several other police officers had.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.219" offset="692224">But Stevens made no mention of requiring a lawyer or ask him for one at that time outside that grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.576" offset="717720">However, when Stevens went into the grand jury, the Assistant District Attorney who had him sign that waiver outside, now for the first time told Stevens that he was not there as a witness but perhaps as a potential defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.198" offset="776129">He then had Stevens identify himself and state that he had signed this waiver outside and he understood the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.895" offset="818970">Stevens gave his name, rank, command, home address and then was told by the Assistant District Attorney that he had a financial questionnaire, and he gave it to him and he told him he would be called at a later date before that grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.098" offset="875813">Stevens was dismissed from that grand jury and it's our contention, he gave no relevant testimonies such there's no question as to what statements were given there except his name, command, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.481" offset="925341">Stevens was -- on July 15th, called back again before the New York County grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.422" offset="957106">However this time, it was a new grand jury that had been specially impaneled to look into the crimes of bribery and corruption within the police department and the Assistant District Attorney told him in my presence, this time he's represented by a counsel that they required Stevens to sign a new waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.345" offset="1036727">Stevens went into the grand jury and then in there, informed the Assistant District Attorney that he did not wish to sign this new waiver of immunity, as a matter of fact, wished to recall the one that was signed on June 26th.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.802" offset="1098585">The Assistant District Attorney admonished Stevens by telling that it was a requirement that he must sign this waiver or he would be summarily dismissed from his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.327" offset="1148635">After having told them this, he told them that he had a constitutional right to exert -- assert his privilege and he could at any time invoke this privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.862" offset="1206836">Stevens of course stated these -- stood on his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.808" offset="1222614">He was dismissed from that grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.514" offset="1233377">However, one week later, the petitioner Stevens was called back before the New York County grand jury, this time, before the original grand jury where he had signed the limited waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.186" offset="1292100">The Assistant District Attorney brought him into the grand jury, asked him questions and each question was responded by Stevens that in fact that he stood on its constitutional rights not to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.763" offset="1350405">Whereupon, after refusing to answer any questions, he was brought up before a New York County Supreme Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.793" offset="1390529">He was commanded by that Supreme Court judge to go down and answer the questions on the grounds that he had been given immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.458" offset="1421249">At this point, the Assistant District Attorney stood up and told the judge sitting there that Stevens does not have immunity but it was the people's contention that he had signed a good and valid waiver and they wished him to speak under this waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.609" offset="1481853">The Supreme Court judge, Charles Marks, which is Number 210 before this Court, told Stevens to go back and answer the questions when he read them and he specifically asked him the same question at the District Court Attorney asked him in that grand jury and that question is this, whether or not Stevens in the five year -- last five years had accepted any moneys from bookmakers or policy operators to allow them to operate violation of the penal law of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.271" offset="1608495">Stevens refused to answer on the grounds that might incriminate him, whereupon, Stevens was summarily found guilty of criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.516" offset="1649455">Counsel at that time asked -- say at that time so they can submit written memorandum and for oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.463" offset="1685191">Judge Marks consented, however, on the oral argument which counsel pointed out that Stevens was not represented by counsel that the waiver was not a good and valid waiver since Stevens, as far as we are concerned was coerced into signing that waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.666" offset="1766066">And third, the fact that only a month before this Court in a Malloy versus Hogan decision has stated that the Fifth Amendment was now applicable upon the states as Stevens like any other citizen could take the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.007" offset="1827401">However, Judge Marks fines Stevens some $250 and sentenced him to 30 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.840" offset="1858748">He did get counsel time to apply for the Appellate Division which was in summer recess because this happened in July to stay the execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.910" offset="1895006">Counsel made application for the presiding judge of the Appellate Division for refuse to stay at this sentence until the fall term on -- the Appellate Division would come back on th ebench.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.860" offset="1942862">As a result, Stevens went to jail for the first time with criminal contempt served -- and while serving by the way, for the first 30 days, counsel made application in the Federal District Court for writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.655" offset="2005974">That court denied the writ based on the fact that Stevens had not exhausted his state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.635" offset="2037948">Therefore, Stevens finished serving his first term of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.768" offset="2062399">Soon after coming out of civil jail and paying the $250 fine, Stevens was again subpoenaed before the New York County grand jury once again with the same grand jury where he had signed his coerced waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.205" offset="2128227">Once again --</text>

            <text syncTime="518.091" offset="2175770">The fact that the pressure was on this man that I don't believe was a free and voluntary act of this party that it served 18 years, leaving two years for retirement which faced with a public scandal, had seen what was happening in the newspapers up there to his family, his wife, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.225" offset="2240240">He felt that he should sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.834" offset="2246719">I'm sure that was the pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.966" offset="2251212">I'm sure any public official faced with this decision whether to give up the years of service after having done, I think almost five years in military service knowing this to be his only job, he signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.196" offset="2304188">I don't think it was a free and voluntary act.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.913" offset="2310980">It is our contention that it was coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.391" offset="2320906">Of course -- now, he's back before that same grand jury, he is asked by that same Assistant District Attorney the same question whether or not for the last five years, he had received any money from bookmakers or policy operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.895" offset="2382973">Once again, standing on his constitutional rights, he refused to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.168" offset="2404080">Once again, he was brought up again before the New York Supreme Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.255" offset="2428426">This time, it was Judge Weiser.</text>

            <text syncTime="616.928" offset="2571055">As a result, before this mandate was now signed by Judge Weiser, counsel under Titles 28 -- U.S. Code 1443, removed the proceedings from the state court into the federal court claiming that Stevens' constitutional rights will be violated by the state court and an application of course was brought by the state to bring the case back into the state and that federal judge then and there from the bench decided that we came too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.118" offset="2715878">He said, the man is already sentenced, I do not have jurisdiction as a result of which, Stevens case was transferred back from the federal court to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.347" offset="2752763">Stevens started serving his second 30-day sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.044" offset="2775542">While in jail for the second time, the Appellate Division came down and denied the application of count -- rather denied, made decision in which they relied on the Regan cases controlling and stated in that decision that they were not entering into the Malloy or the Escobedo case as far as the constitutionality of the questions posed by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.583" offset="2885674">Stevens finished serving his second 30-day term in civil jail, paid his $250 fine and when released, found himself again subpoenaed before the same grand jury now for the third time, met again by that same Assistant District Attorney, again asked the same question, again brought up before the New York Supreme Court judge, commanded again to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.313" offset="2992671">Once again relying on his rights was then and there sentenced now for the third time, to a civil jail for 30 days, fined $250 or the alternative, another 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.608" offset="3045752">It was pointed out to that Supreme Court justice that as far as counsel was concerned, this has not only became double jeopardy or triple jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.550" offset="3085563">It was also pointed out that Supreme Court justice that the state court still had an appeal pending in the Court of Appeals, the highest court in the State of New York, and when he stay the execution of his third sentence until we got a reply back or decision back from Albany.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.780" offset="3158497">That was denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.866" offset="12066879">At the very least, you cannot say with assurance as you could -- as you said in Regan that Stevens would have received (Inaudible) complete immunity from the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.003" offset="12103346">That -- and that assurance was what -- was the predict -- essential predicate of the Regan rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.129" offset="12127901">I would also like to leave with you one further thought in distinguishing the Regan case and that is the confusing entrapment to which the Assistant District Attorney put this petitioner, having told him that you've waived immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.386" offset="12184952">He constantly says, “And you understand that any time, you can invoke your privilege against self-incrimination under the United States Constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.886" offset="12222882">And when he proceeded to do that, he then found himself entrapped into a contempt citation and a jail sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.793" offset="12254542">Now, we maintain that under the similar facts and decision in Raley v. Ohio that this constitutes an unconstitutional entrapment which was not involved in the Regan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.643" offset="12305951">And is sufficiently different on the whole factual atmosphere of the case -- two cases to distinguish the situation here from that in Regan and to make its reasoning inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.874" offset="12362898">But to go ahead to the ultimate constitutional question which is before Your Honors, I submit that the combined effect of the state constitution and city charter provisions is to run directly contrary to the principle established by this Court in Malloy v. Hogan as applicable to states to wit the principle that the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the states to resort to imprisonment to compel him to answer questions that might incriminate the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.180" offset="12496123">And why is that true in this -- and with respect to these two provisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.880" offset="12518902">I think the answer to that lies in the corollaries to the basic principle which were recognized in Malloy v. Hogan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.119" offset="12547845">The first of which is that every person has a right to remain silent in the unfettered exercise of his own will which necessarily implies that you have a right to waive your immunity in the unfettered exercise of your own will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.290" offset="12620570">And the second principle in Malloy v. Hogan is that the individual shall suffer no penalty or burden because he freely elects to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.806" offset="12670621">Now here, I submit that both of those principles were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.683" offset="12686085">This petitioner, because practically at the invitation or the advice of the Assistant District Attorney to the effect that he had this privilege against self-incrimination, and because he exercised it, he suffers not only the loss of his employment, contention rights, but he goes to prison for having refused to answer an incriminating question in reliance upon the federal privilege what the prosecutor repeatedly said was available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.170" offset="12808025">Moreover, and perhaps even more importantly, the impact of these provisions at the time he invoked the privilege or made the determination as to whether to invoke it or not, completely destroyed his unfettered exercise of his own will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.075" offset="12879705">The choice at that point was no longer whether he should remain silent or whether he should speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.666" offset="12902066">The question was -- put to him in these terms, either you waive your privilege and speak and incriminate yourself if we're right that there was no complete immunity available to him or you will lose your job, your employment rights and your pension rights, and in addition, you will go to jail for contempt in refusing to answer an incriminating question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.616" offset="13009795">Now, it seems to me obviously that that time of a choice is one that no state can constitutionally impose upon an individual when confronted with an incriminating question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.395" offset="13056920">It's precisely the kind of an unconstitutional choice which this Court referred to in Frost against Railroad Commission as a choice between a rock and a whirlpool.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.723" offset="13098297">An option to forego a privilege which may be vital to his livelihood such as public employment or to submit to a requirement which may constitute an intolerable burden to wit waiving an immunity and incriminating himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.834" offset="13166738">And the fact that this petitioner did sign a waiver of immunity without advice of counsel and did then to the pressure of this choice does not change the situation, one with constitutionally speaking because the coercive impact of this upon the petitioner was nonetheless obvious by virtue of the fact that he took the choice which seemed to him at the moment to be in his best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.061" offset="13291604">But it was nonetheless a choice which the state could not have forced upon him constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.151" offset="13311979">And the result of that choice I repeat is to run back directly to what was outlawed in Malloy v. Hogan that he has been imprisoned as a result of making one of these choices put upon him, imprisoned because he refused to incriminate himself and relied instead upon his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.569" offset="13397661">Now what justification does the state offer for this illegal choice?</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.665" offset="13418036">They say various things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.915" offset="13423052">One is that a waiver of the Fifth Amendment is a valid condition of public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.776" offset="13450428">And if the state must have freedom to ferret out crime among its employees that policemen are especially obligated to cooperate in investigations into their official conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.786" offset="13498493">But the critical question is how can the state's interest if that would be a valid interest, be manifested under the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.471" offset="13537259">Well, I suggest that if that interest is recognizable, it is recognizable solely in terms of the employment relationship and that is not involved in this case whatsoever Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.002" offset="13591385">In answer to -- with the reference to the Chief Justice's earlier inquiry, I suggest that we do not have to reach the question whether the employment forfeiture and discharge of this petitioner was valid or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.775" offset="13654497">That is not the questions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.944" offset="13663169">These are solely contempt proceedings and if there's an independent proceeding going on as to whether the employment discharge here was valid or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.158" offset="13704025">But in any event, the question as to whether the states interests in -- and in waiving -- having the employee cooperate is something that can be exhibited only in terms of proper disciplinary proceedings involving possibly discharge and pursuant to due process requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.925" offset="13791065">And that is all the courts have ever held that have indicated that policemen or public employees are under an obligation to cooperate and not to plea the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.406" offset="13837040">The state's interest is solely in terms of the employment relationship but I suggest that the state cannot exert its interest here in such a way as it has in this case so as to destroy the public employees' privilege against self-incrimination until the result being to put him into imprisonment for having elected to remain silent in the face of an incriminating question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.331" offset="13944665">But the Fifth Amendment put it differently, said that no person shall be compelled to incriminate himself in a criminal proceeding and there is no exception in terms of public employees or policemen, and so that no more than an employee cannot be imprisoned by a state for having asserted the First Amendment of free speech no less should a state would be prohibited from imprisoning an individual and a public employee if you will because it wants him to incriminate himself and that he has relied instead upon his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.948" offset="14111117">So that anyway you look at it, these provisions get back to the principle which Malloy v. Hogan and prior cases that long since established that the state simply cannot resort to imposing such a choice as these provisions may, a choice upon the individual to compel him to answer questions that might incriminate him and particularly so in the absence of an absolute automatic immunity statute available to him without any discretion whatsoever on the part of the grand jury or the District Attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="4323.647" offset="17397948">2447 is the new statute that provides the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.177" offset="17420100">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals was exactly as explicit on page 61 of 290.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.926" offset="17455104">That court said, and I'll have to skip a few words, but it said in effect, “Indeed if Stevens' waiver is defective as we view the relevant provisions of the State Penal Law, immunity from prosecution will automatically follow,” and they cited 2447.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.054" offset="17519574">So that there is -- I suggest at this point nothing for this Court to decide as to whether or not he would have received immunity from prosecution pursuant to state law if he had followed the Court's directions and responded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.176" offset="17584044">Now if that is conclusive as we submit it is, then this case is factually indistinguishable from the Regan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.936" offset="17615078">Now it's true that there has been a major change in the law in New York as there has been the federal law as to the procedures by which immunity is granted prior to the enactment of 2447, anybody witnessed or target called before a grand jury who was asked an incriminating question and answered that question received immunity and that was that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.912" offset="17698983">2447 was intended to be a benefit to the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.189" offset="17716120">2447 obviously was to protect the sleepy -- the nodding prosecutor from an inadvertent grant of immunity to a witness who -- to his surprise came out with a self-incriminatory answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.706" offset="17774216">And it provided that in order to get immunity, the witness must himself alert the prosecutor that he has about to become immunized by asserting his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.584" offset="17817684">At that point, certain procedures have provided by which he can be commanded to answer and if he does, receives immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="4463.263" offset="17956446">It also says that the Court may order a witness who asserts his privilege to answer presumably without the question of the District Attorney in a matter except a proceeding before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.644" offset="17997928">So the only real question here is whether or not the Court in this case in ordering, it was acting on behalf of the form and whether or not he was a competent authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.014" offset="18035440">I suggest there's no real question here in as much as it was decided below that immunity would have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.673" offset="18062085">And furthermore, it's -- I think quite unusual to assume that a District Attorney could under these circumstances ever assert in the future that the man had not been granted immunity because the technical requirements of 2447 were not complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.950" offset="18119137">And the law of the case as decided by the Appellate Division is to that effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="4543.611" offset="18277857">However, we do have in New York and this is where it gets really unfortunately complicated, another kind of testimonial protection and that is the type of testimony and protection that was involved in the Laino case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.599" offset="18329788">That is not, strictly speaking, immunity in the Counselman against Hitchcock sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.552" offset="18349537">It is not complete protection against prosecution of such a nature as it will supplant or replace privilege against self-incrimination but it is a form of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.926" offset="18395094">And what it is, is simply this and this is decided in the case of People against Steuding in New York cited in our brief by Judge Fuller, written by Judge Fuller.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.713" offset="18434173">Judge Fuller says that notwithstanding the provisions of 2447 in New York where a target of an investigation or a potential defendant is called before a grand jury he is there illegally at the start.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.214" offset="18492270">He said that a potential defendant derives his rights against self-incrimination directly from Article I, Section 6 of the New York Constitution which provides that he shall not be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.178" offset="18536051">So that if the prosecutor does in violation of his rights call him and swear him as a witness before the grand jury, he acquires a certain type of protection and that protection is that he cannot be indicted by that grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.411" offset="18592998">He cannot be punished for contempt if he fails to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.228" offset="18604283">He cannot be punished for forgery if answers falsely because the oath is not validly administered to say and he cannot be prosecuted on the basis of any evidence that may have been uncovered by virtue of his testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="4767.953" offset="19175215">In any event, at the time just before he was held in contempt of the court, there was a colloquy, a discussion before the judge who held them in contempt to court at which time, and this is in the record as well, at which time the District Attorney discussed the applicability of the Regan case which I just come down at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.401" offset="19256926">And the District Attorney maintained in the presence of defendant and his counsel to the Court that the Stevens case was indistinguishable from Regan and that the same double protection which was accorded to Regan under the statute which was then applicable would be available to the defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.413" offset="19325053">He did not, mind you, abandon his theory that the defendant had waived his immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.345" offset="19344802">But he did indicate that if he was wrong in that theory, the defendant would be accorded so that, again, the law of the case is -- from the very outset, the very issues which we are now arguing were known and were before the court and in the defendant's knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.547" offset="19413556">Now I was about to say that the Steuding case and the Laino case have revived the efficacy of this waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.173" offset="19464025">When 2447 was enacted, the slip of paper which is called the waiver of immunity might be thought to have been a -- an anachronistic relic of no further significance because obviously if the only way you get immunity is by asserting your privilege, then presumably the correct way to waive immunity would be to answer the question without asserting the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.314" offset="19560678">And in the point of fact, I'm informed that that is precisely the way potential defendants waive their immunity in federal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.884" offset="19594951">Nonetheless, we have this slip of paper called a waiver of immunity which before is the people's theory, it is, was binding upon the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.388" offset="19628910">Well the efficacy of that slip of paper becomes apparent when you consider the Steuding case because the Steuding case returns the potential defendant and this petitioner was denominated a potential defendant from the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.489" offset="19681364">Returns him to the position he was in, as Regan was, before 2447 not that he receives complete and total immunity but that he does receive very extensive Murphy type of protection if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.497" offset="19733400">Consequently, if he did not execute this waiver of immunity, before being sworn, he would have received protection against indictment by that grand jury, a protection against the use of his testimony or his moots in any future proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.230" offset="19792332">Consequently, if that waiver of immunity which he signed was a legally significant and operative act from which legal consequences flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.379" offset="19828903">In point of fact, there is a law in New York that no potential defendant may be called before a grand jury unless he executes a waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.502" offset="19861400">Consequently, his entry into the floor, the opportunity to express his side to learn the questions which were being asked to see the financial questionnaire which he received in this case and so on was all conditioned upon his execution of that instrument known as a waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.365" offset="19932871">A legally operable act, an act which an adult knowingly undertakes having been fully advised of the consequences is normally binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.848" offset="19978742">And as a waiver, it is no more, no less finding than in the other legally operable act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.948" offset="20007163">It is not an insignificant promise, a mere undertaking not to assert any privilege but is a significant and operable act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5374.788" offset="21602513">And I suggest that -- for that reason although I propose now to discuss the merits of the question on which cert was granted that certiorari was improperly granted and should be dismissed because I think it is not only as a question not drawn an issue by the decision below but I think that if this Court would be properly reluctant to construe or to rule upon the constitutionality of such an important provision of the state constitution without affording the courts of that state an opportunity to do so first.</text>

            <text syncTime="5729.167" offset="23020022">I think that the -- there is only that -- in fact, the Court did say in the Steuding case itself but one thing we're not passing on here is whether he can be subsequently reindicted by a fresh grand jury on fresh evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5741.420" offset="23069027">And then in the subsequent case, they did pass on that question and said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.030" offset="23083447">So, that seems to me the Steuding case gives protection up to that point and complete protection up to that point which is I think the protection which was sanctioned in the Murphy case when you have a cross jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.262" offset="23148440">Now there was a great deal made during the oral argument and in the brief about the petitioner here, of the fact that the District Attorney somehow during these proceedings had consistently and repeatedly told the defendant that he had the privilege still available to him and he uses this as a leaver in order to bring the Raley against Ohio decision to bear upon the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.880" offset="23246869">In effect, he asserts that we entrap Stevens into the assertion of his privilege and then prosecuted him for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.224" offset="23284276">I think this is based upon a misconstruction of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.423" offset="23297024">And again, I would like to refer to the facts, the procedure that is followed -- the procedure that was followed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.094" offset="23327744">This defendant signed, physically signed the paper that is called a waiver of immunity before coming into the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.864" offset="23354807">This is customarily done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.192" offset="23368182">After he got into the grand jury, before he was given the oath and before any mentioned was made at the waiver of immunity, before he acknowledged the signature under oath, he was asked his name and so forth and given instructions by the prosecutor giving advice, very full, very complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="5834.480" offset="23441324">He was told at the outset that he was a potential defendant and he was told that as a potential defendant, what he said could be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.394" offset="23472985">He was told that as a potential defendant he had the right to assert his privilege against self-incrimination at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.169" offset="23500048">That is the language which he relies upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.472" offset="23509243">The prosecutor having said, you may assert your privilege at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.576" offset="23525648">But mind you, it occurred prior to the administration of the oath during the general instructions as to his rights that were being given to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.278" offset="23556472">He then was asked, do you see these piece papers?</text>
            <text syncTime="5866.063" offset="23567653">You know what it is?</text>
            <text syncTime="5866.789" offset="23570578">You understand what it means?</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.859" offset="23574758">He was also told by the way about the constitutional provision and said that if you do assert your privilege, don't sign a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="5874.822" offset="23602657">You're subject to forfeiture of your job and was shown the paper, acknowledged the signature, said it was his.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.261" offset="23636407">He said he understood what it meant, explained to him again and then he was given the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.748" offset="23658350">It is -- the reason for this procedure and the theory behind it is that until he acknowledges that waiver of immunity in the grand jury under oath that it is not an operative document and that the instructions that you may assert the privilege anytime mean that you may refuse to sign the waiver and refuse to acknowledge it, refuse to waive your privilege before this party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.870" offset="23758869">Now it does not mean that having executed the waiver is going to be, you may withdraw that document and rely upon your privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="5955.841" offset="23926784">Now, I mean to proceed at this point to the merits of the question which is whether or not the provision of the New York State Constitution and the comparable provision of the City Charter which require public officers as a condition of continuing in public office to testify before a grand jury under waiver of immunity to answer questions, bearing upon and only bearing upon their performance of their public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.142" offset="24075891">It has been argued that this provision provides a penalty upon the assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.354" offset="24116746">It has been argued that the economic consequences to a defendant who does assert his privilege is within the proscription of the language in Malloy against Hogan proscribing a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6017.271" offset="24172440">The other side of that coin and I think the more proper way of phrasing it is that the economic consequences of failure to waive the privilege constitutes a coercive element which interferes with the exercise of his free will and that free will being necessary to a valid election to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="6041.113" offset="24267839">The reason I say that is that a penalty taken in it of itself within the context of the Fifth Amendment undoubtedly means prosecution, the -- if a person is prosecuted on -- for an account of evidence which it gives then the Fifth Amendment is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.603" offset="24341817">A penalty does not mean within the context of the Fifth Amendment itself simply an adverse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6066.671" offset="24370030">However, if the word penalty is read together with the sentence in which it appears in Malloy, I think it is clear that all what it means is that there must not be such consequences, such penalizing consequences as would interfere with the exercise of free will.</text>
            <text syncTime="6089.672" offset="24462085">The issue it seems to me can be phrased and should be phrased in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.063" offset="24491656">Does a public officer have the right to continue in that office free of any regulation which comports with the nature of his job or is he subject to reasonable regulations and expectations which do reasonably relate to the nature of his job notwithstanding the fact that such regulations may in some degree encroach upon his constitutional privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.713" offset="24638255">Now, this Court has stated in both Wyman against (Inaudible) and of the (Inaudible) case itself that if a -- that a public officer may be subject to reasonable regulations as long as they are not either discriminatory or arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6160.256" offset="24744417">Now, it seems to me that under the established doctrine of those cases and the others which this Court has handled, the only inquiry here is not -- whether or not a regulation, the requirement that he testify encroaches upon Fifth Amendment or for that matter New York state privileges against self-incrimination but rather, whether it is a reasonable regulation consistent with the nature of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.059" offset="24843577">It is our contention and it has been our contention throughout that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6190.748" offset="24866356">We -- it takes no great stretch of the imagination to realize that there are many forms of public employment which are conditioned upon at least partial relinquishment of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.073" offset="24919646">Federal employees may not associate themselves with others in certain types of political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6210.560" offset="24945664">They may not express their political beliefs in certain respects and still be public employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="6217.029" offset="24971473">Certainly, in the military and I should think for example that a teacher employed by a municipal government who insisted upon conducting religious services in her classroom in the exercise of her freedom of religion might nonetheless be constitutionally discharged from her duty -- from her duties for the assertion of that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="6239.207" offset="25060185">It doesn't seem to me in and of itself either shocking or repugnant that certain forms of public employment have certainly reasonable restrictions upon the exercise of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6254.102" offset="25119744">A penalty, the threat of loss of a job, it seems to me cannot be taken without regard to the nature of the public employment which is to be forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="6269.259" offset="25180453">A police officer, indeed a public officer of any sort is responsible not only to his superior officers but is responsible to the community at large who are in a very real sense, his employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6283.316" offset="25236668">No one I don't think would doubt the authority of the police commissioner of the City of New York to call in a lieutenant albeit a man who has 17 or 18 years on the force and ask him the question which was asked him before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6297.095" offset="25291734">Have you taken bribes in order to protect gamblers?</text>
            <text syncTime="6300.885" offset="25306885">I'm sure that nobody doubts that if an officer elected to stand on his constitutional privilege had refused to answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.816" offset="25342621">The police commissioner could remove him from his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.303" offset="25356622">Now, whether he is removing him from his office solely on the basis of the assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege or whether the assertion of that privilege demonstrates a form of unfitness, I think is an academic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6327.409" offset="25413047">I think that the power is certainly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.385" offset="25428929">Now if the police officer chooses to answer the question and thus admit -- answers truthfully and thus admit that he has done certain acts which would subject him to criminal punishment, I don't think that anyone doubts that the superior officer could proceed to the District Attorney's Office or directly to the grand jury and have a criminal action instituted against him and even used that admission against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6358.835" offset="25538748">In order words, a superior officer does not have the power to grant immunity in exchange for asking the officer with his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6371.131" offset="25587858">Now the real question here it seems to me is whether or not the situation is changed by the fact that the forum changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.194" offset="25620146">And the police officer rather than being before his superior in the role of employee if you will or at certain is before the grand jury which is a quasi -- independent quasi judicial party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.963" offset="25671241">We submit that the situation is not changed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6395.752" offset="25686392">In the first place, there is a special relationship between the public servant and the grand jury which does not exist between private individuals in the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6406.181" offset="25728084">He is not a private citizen who is threatened with criminal punishment appearing before an alien body.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.139" offset="25751907">He is in a very real sense, the employee answering to the agents of his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6419.301" offset="25780537">His salary is paid by the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.302" offset="25792554">He is subject to public scrutiny for the performance of his duty and indeed this relationship is recognized by a statute in the very same constitutional provision which we are here dealing with where it is provided that the grand jury does have special powers to oversee and supervise the conduct of public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="6442.544" offset="25873533">Consequently, as an employee, it seems to me that he can expect no greater benefit from the incidental fact that the grand jury unlike his superior officer has the power to confer immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.418" offset="25941034">Indeed, the power to confer immunity by the grand jury is limited to certain types of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6464.972" offset="25963290">The police officer who is called by a grand jury to answer as to an investigation into burglary or sale of narcotics or something of that sort could not receive immunity from that grand jury under any circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6479.097" offset="26019715">Just because the grand jury is looking into bribery, just because the investigation happens to concern conspiracy, does he thereby obtain benefits which he would not merely have before his superior officer?</text>

            <text syncTime="7392.825" offset="29674663">The foreman of the grand jury said to the defendant, “You answer the questions and if you answer those questions, you will be immunized against the prosecution for conspiracy or bribery.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7402.860" offset="29714787">The defendant refused to answer questions and was held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="7405.978" offset="29727326">The contempt was set aside on the ground that that advice was inaccurate that in point of fact he would have been immunized against any crime which he'd given an incriminating answers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="7416.308" offset="29768600">And because of the fact that the advice was inaccurate, he couldn't have been held in contempt for having continued to refuse to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="7423.149" offset="29795976">That's the De Feo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7425.065" offset="29803604">Based upon that case, it does seems to me that there is some state law in New York which does require accurate appraisal of the significance of the immunity conferred on the extent of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7435.843" offset="29846758">But I do also suggest to this Court that that is not a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="7440.597" offset="29865775">And that if this case should be remanded to the state courts for consideration of the issue which is now before this Court that the Court may, I don't concede the point because there may be arguments on the other side as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="7452.516" offset="29913422">But the Court may feel that the contempt conviction was invalid in as much as he was not accurately appraise of the significance of the immunity under De Feo.</text>
            <text syncTime="7462.431" offset="29953128">Now I can report that there is a good deal of confusion in New York as to the significance of De Feo but it does seem to indicate that as a matter of state law, there is some requirement of accurate advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="7476.896" offset="30010911">I insist that this is not based upon the constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7480.369" offset="30024808">It's not based upon the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment because whether or not he did received accurate advice and whether immunity attaches whether he receives accurate advice or not or whether a contempt conviction can be sustained whether he receives accurate information or not, it seems to me as a matter of local law.</text>

            <text syncTime="7619.931" offset="30583097">And there is a paramount interest it seems to me which overrides his interest in knowing whether he is receiving immunity or not and that interest is to continue with the grand jury investigation or it might be another case of trial which is actually under way at the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="8132.686" offset="32634128">Then no one would hold that after they deserted the privilege all this time, somebody finds out that there's an automatic immunity provision in the State of Ohio and that they were compelled to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="8140.969" offset="32667251">They didn't have the privilege at all and they were all charged with contempt for asserting the privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="8318.045" offset="33375587">Now what does he get from the claim of privilege under those circumstances?</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Richard Uviller</label>
            <text syncTime="8323.181" offset="33396067">How he -- I -- this -- unfortunately the record is maybe somewhat ambiguous but I think a fair reading of the record Mr. Chief Justice indicates that what he was doing at that time was instructing the witness that he had a right not to sign the waiver at all and to stand on his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="8338.636" offset="33457925">Now it's true he said at any time but if you look at the context in which at anytime occurs before he'd ever executed the waiver, I think that it is clear that what he meant was at anytime up to the time he was sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="8349.968" offset="33503274">You may refuse to come in here under a waiver and stand on your privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="8354.062" offset="33519574">That's your right which it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="8355.963" offset="33527202">And in assessing whether he want to do that, I must tell you that if you come in here under a waiver you will be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="8362.184" offset="33552071">Now there maybe a slight ambiguity there but I don't think it's substantial and I think that the petitioner understood it full well because on the subsequent occasion he refused to sign his waiver and did stand on his Fifth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="8375.466" offset="33605256">He is a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="8376.650" offset="33609958">He has considerable experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="8378.882" offset="33618944">He is lieutenant who has passed two police examinations to achieve that rank and I think it's fair to think that he took the reasonable explanation of it and did not think.</text>
            <text syncTime="8388.955" offset="33659173">Particularly, he said, he was told by the court again you see, before he was held in contempt the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="8393.129" offset="33675891">The court again said to him, you don't have a privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="8395.518" offset="33685400">Now you answer this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="8397.994" offset="33695326">He could not possibly have thought that he had -- after signing the waiver that he still have the right to assert a privilege at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="8404.150" offset="33719986">I think that's really inconsistent with the plain meaning of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="8415.369" offset="33764812">Mr. Chief Justice, I only want to make two brief remarks in connection with the -- these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="8424.621" offset="33801906">The first goes to the point Your Honor was just speaking about the applicability of the Raley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8431.449" offset="33829177">It seems to me the longer the discussion has ensued in these cases, the more obvious it becomes that we have an almost exact parallel with the Raley situation where the defendant was told expressly on numerous occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="8448.798" offset="33898559">On almost every occasion he appeared before the grand jury up to and including the last time on January 11th, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="8456.939" offset="33931160">He again, as repeat -- is repeated to him referring to the original appearance in there that you were told at that time that you could invoke the federal privilege against self-incrimination at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="8470.262" offset="33984449">This was repeated to him on the second occasion when he appeared before the grand jury as well as at the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="8477.593" offset="34013706">So that I think that -- then he add to that effect that the immunity possibilities were never discussed or referred to by the Assistant District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="8490.841" offset="34066787">In the contrary, he was told expressly that it's the position of the people that you do not have immunity and it was stated to him that you can and will be prosecuted on the basis of any incriminating testimony that you will give or may give before this grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="8507.617" offset="34133870">Then we find subsequent to these convictions the flat statement by the Appellate Division and by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that you had absolute immunity under these ambiguous provisions of New York State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="8525.876" offset="34206908">That is exactly what the Ohio Supreme Court had held in Raley.</text>
            <text syncTime="8529.735" offset="34222268">After they've gotten through those confusing proceedings without any reference to an immunity statute, subsequently, the convictions are affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="8539.306" offset="34260616">And for the first time that it is stated affirmatively that the Raley defendants had immunity all the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="8644.140" offset="34679933">Well, again as a matter of legal anal -- treatment of the problem, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="8649.024" offset="34699473">But as a matter of practical matter, that was not certainly indicated to the defendant at the time he was called upon the third time to answer this incriminating question.</text>
            <text syncTime="8660.612" offset="34745866">But in any event, I think the Assistant District Attorney here, Mr. Uviller has very candidly observed and properly so that the immunity of 2447 does not operate automatically that there is room -- a necessary room here for discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8682.584" offset="34833742">And in answer to the Chief Justice, he conceded that the District Attorney did not exercise a discretion to bring the complete immunity under 2447 into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8695.582" offset="34885674">And I suggest that is the only way that this record can be analyzed and the only way in which this immunity problem can be handled that it was not an automatic immunity and if there'd be any question as to it, certainly I suggest that there should be some form of a remand to the state courts either to determine the extent of any immunity if there was such or under the Murphy decision to have a completely new proceeding before the grand jury in which the rights of this defendant are adequately and properly and fairly explained to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="8738.714" offset="35058186">And you will note at the very end of Murphy v. Waterfront Commission in remanding the case in that instance, they cite the Raley case where there was this confusion and the unfairness which certainly has been exhibited in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="8754.623" offset="35121821">Thank you.</text>
