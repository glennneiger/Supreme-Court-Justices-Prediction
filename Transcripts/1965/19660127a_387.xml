            <text syncTime="21.240" offset="188374">The facts which I shall detail for you here today present essentially two questions affecting national labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.613" offset="221811">The first question is, shall a uniform federal time limit apply to suits under Section 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act as amended?</text>
            <text syncTime="41.809" offset="270608">Or shall the variant state statutes of limitations apply to those suits?</text>
            <text syncTime="48.339" offset="296730">The second question is, if state time limits are held to be applicable shall a suit for vacation pay on the written terms of a collective bargaining agreement be treated for the purposes of selecting the applicable time limitation be treated as a suit under federal law and governed by federal principles or be treated as a suit under state law or wages under state principles and therefore determined by state principles of law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen I. Schlossberg</label>
            <text syncTime="96.459" offset="489200">On September 1st, 1955, the union -- the petitioner in this case entered into a collective bargaining agreement for the Hoosier Cardinal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.631" offset="533922">Among the contract provisions in that collective bargaining agreement was one which required certain vacations for employees employed under that contract.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen I. Schlossberg</label>
            <text syncTime="119.327" offset="580629">There was a further provision that employee's who were eligible for vacation on the basis of time's work -- time worked and who had not taken their vacation on the previous year should receive vacation pay at the time of termination, if they were terminated for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.866" offset="646875">On June the 1st, 1957, approximately a couple of years after the contract was first entered into over 100 workers were terminated, workers who had not taken their vacations in the previous year.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.972" offset="703300">The company refused to pay their vacation pay required by the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.291" offset="724511">Eight months later, the union's attorneys, local counsel filed in the Indiana State Court a class action seeking recovery of the vacation pay due the employees covered by the Hoosier Cardinal-UAW collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.467" offset="793266">At that time, this Court will recall that the decision of this Court in the Association of Westinghouse employees against Westinghouse Electric Corporation appeared to the bar to preclude a Section 301 suit in the federal courts for this kind of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.661" offset="870066">On January 21st, 1959, the state court ruled that the class action was improper under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.292" offset="904547">Thereafter, each employee in the class, each employee covered by the agreement assigned his wage claim to a union representative and the complaint was amended to provide for a suit by a union representative in his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.390" offset="964942">The court then ruled that the assignment method of suit was improper in Indiana and further amended complaints were entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.501" offset="1001409">In essence, the original class action was reinstituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.326" offset="1016665">On demur from the company, the trail court finally held that the class suit method was improper and dismissed the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.184" offset="1060133">This case was appealed to the Indiana Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.834" offset="1074657">And on April 18, 1963, approximately almost 6 years after the right had vested the suit was finally dismissed by the Indiana Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.546" offset="1125543">In the mean time, Smith against The Evening News in 371 United States in 1962 had enlightened the bar and had effectively in our view overruled the Westinghouse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.428" offset="1185102">So on April 8th, 1964 less than a year after the final dismissal of the Indiana action, this Section 301 (a) suit was instituted in the United States District Court -- pardon me Your Honors, of the Southern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.988" offset="1255320">In addition to citing provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and asserting jurisdiction under Section 301 (a), the complaints sought an additional remedy on the state law of double wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.800" offset="1306624">Whether we're entitled to that remedy or not, we do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.472" offset="1321253">We thought the decisions for this Court were not clear on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.618" offset="1333896">At any rate, that remedy was sought with the 301 action -- 301 (a) action.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.963" offset="1359182">The company in the United States District Court urged their lack of jurisdiction citing Westinghouse and saying also to the court that the Indiana statute of limitations for oral contracts which I know is six years govern the suit because said the company, “This suit is bottomed on the oral contracts of hire and not on the collective bargaining agreement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="339.336" offset="1460746">The District Court on November the 12th, 1964, upheld the company's contention as to the statute of limitations and dismissed the union suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.790" offset="1502542">On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the union's principal arguments were, first, that state statute of limitations do not and cannot apply to Section 301 contract actions because these suits are governed exclusively by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.577" offset="1573700">And second, that in any event, this suit was timely because it was wholly on a written collective bargaining agreement and not on an oral contract of hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.757" offset="1618422">On June 4th, 1965, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court holding that the Indiana state statute of limitations six years on oral contracts governed because the suit is bottomed on the oral contract of hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.398" offset="1684982">The Court of Appeals went further and held that the suit was really a suit by a union as an agent to enforce pay rights of individual workers and that here involved was a question wholly of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.226" offset="1756244">Very frankly, if the Court please, our problem in the presentation of this case boils down to in essence, a situation where we feel, we cannot lose under either theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.204" offset="1816221">In other words, if the Court adopts which we hope and fully expect it to adopt, our theory that uniformed federal limitations must apply to federal suits under 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act and in lined with that theory, follows through on its decision in Burnett against the New York Central Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.218" offset="1904201">Then on the federal principles of timeliness, this suit is timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.718" offset="1922278">On the other hand, if the court holds that state limitations must apply, we think it clear on the principles of federal law that this is a suit exclusively on the written terms of a collective bargaining agreement and not on an oral contract in the Indiana written statute of limitations which is 20 years would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.417" offset="2013080">While it may be easier and a simpler task to urge upon this Court the 20 years statute because this is clearly a written contract, we very strongly urged on this Court, the federal principles, the uniformity principles so important to the development of Section 301 (a) law.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.696" offset="2094164">And we say that we want uniform federal time standards to govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.053" offset="2115584">We believe that the adoption of state statute of limitation which vary and we have put together a table in our petitioner for certiorari in Appendix B of our petition for certiorari that state statute of limitations which vary from six months to 20 years would inevitably lead to a crazy quilt pattern of limitations, confusing labor and management, the bar, and even the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.435" offset="2237106">The real problem in this case as we view it is that the Seventh Circuit viewed this suit as one of state law and their rationale is at war with the federal law which must be supreme in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.776" offset="2294471">The reasoning of the Court of Appeals that this suit on the express provisions of a written collective bargaining agreement is actually based on an oral contract of hire and if the union sues only as an agent here on a purely state claim, if we say, not only anachronistic but offensive to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.933" offset="2387153">We see it is very clear that Congress has intended for that to be a uniform body of federal law under Section 301 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="578.899" offset="2418918">We take that mandate from the intent of Congress as determined in Lincoln Mills in 353 United States and Dowd Box of 368 and in the Lucas Flour case in 369 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.212" offset="2480253">As this -- toward this Court thought, there must be comprehension in the formulation of the law interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.989" offset="2515362">The national policy as we understand it is to see that identical terms of a contract whether enforced to might state law or a federal -- in a state court or a federal court and no matter which court will have the same meaning, and that mandates of the statute will have the same meaning no matter which court enforces them.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.594" offset="2593729">The key to Section 301 (a) as we see it is a national policy that commitments once made will be honored and that the fruits of a bargain will be enjoyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.233" offset="2644302">State statutes of limitations, any statute of limitations if you please, so far affects substantive rights that it can determine the results in the case as it did in this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.113" offset="2687875">We think it paid them that where state contract limitations varying from 60 days to 20 years, there is bound to be confusion and uncertainty in the interpretation and administration of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.464" offset="2741269">And this kind of variety and confusion decides disruptive a labor relation in interstate commerce is likely to encourage forum shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.000" offset="2783378">Moreover and perhaps most important, the antiquated state theories of labor law which have been rejected in the formulation of national labor law, put it back into the field of labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.390" offset="2836982">As in this Seventh Circuit opinion, we are likely to have anachronistic conflicting rules of law which are at war with federal principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.847" offset="2882748">We believe that this Court should adopt the uniform federal standards for the time limitations on 301 suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.900" offset="2914931">We believe that on a suit like this on a breach of contract that six years would be an appropriate time for the court to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.436" offset="2953070">We say that because the median statute of limitations among the states as we've glean from our table is approximately six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.107" offset="2983790">Six years is the time set out for contract suits in the court of claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="963.649" offset="3957948">On the other hand, we think that suits which are in the nature of unfair representation of it joined with 301 (a) actions could be treated as suits involving injury to person or to property and we would suggest there that an appropriate state -- an appropriate federal statute of limitations would be two to three years which is the federal tort -- most federal tort actions and also the normal state tort limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.023" offset="4751444">We think in a federal principle, that a suit brought in the expressed terms of a collective bargaining agreement is a written contract in federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.960" offset="4791254">And we think to say that that suit is bottomed on an oral contract of hire and to transform a written contract into an oral contract for purposes of the states statute of limitations is a distortion of federal law and a confliction with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.563" offset="4869622">And we think that even if the state time period is applied, it is absorbed into the interstices from the federal system and becomes a part of federal law adopted for convenience from a state and that -- under that federal law, a written contract must be treated as 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.067" offset="4939630">Now, we think 20 years is a long time in labor relations for a contract to go.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.645" offset="5037955">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.559" offset="5053628">I will first like to address myself to the jurisdictional questions that were raised in the courts below briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.941" offset="5091140">As it's been indicated at the time this litigation arose and prior to the Smith case if it did overrule Westinghouse clearly, this case could not have been maintained in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.635" offset="5145893">The facts are almost identical in which the union was seeking to recover vacation pay and even further in this case they're seeking to recover statutory penalties for double damages and attorney fees which of course would be allowed but only under the Indiana state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.030" offset="5227499">So, we thought there is a serious question as to whether or not Smith had effectively overruled Westinghouse in this particular type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.779" offset="5266474">So we raised the point, and I'm sure that I'm not going to deliver it because you gentlemen are -- I'm sure familiar with both cases but we did think that when -- that the Smith case did not go to the extent of staying that in a case such as these where the union itself seeks to recover purely personal rights for the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.439" offset="5353096">There's no relief sought in these case or behalf of union as such at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.425" offset="5373053">And finding out that under Indiana law a claim for statutory penalties under this case we've cited in our brief, McKinney versus Standard Oil, holds that claim for statutory penalties is not even assignable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.010" offset="5443375">Only the employee himself can recover that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.153" offset="5459989">Well, we think -- we thought that where a union here is trying to recover those particular type of recoveries on behalf of this employees that we questioned whether Smith did go so far as to overrule Westinghouse in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.648" offset="5521951">For that reason, we raised the question below and frankly the District Court had some difficulty with that problem and the Circuit Court of Appeals didn't discuss it very much except that say that they thought it was -- this case did not conflict with those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.850" offset="5594781">Our second point that we have raised in our jurisdictional question and I want to mention that just briefly and that is that we relied upon Republic versus Maddox which is on the proposition that it -- there was no grievance filed in this case, although, the contract required that the court would not have a jurisdiction to entertain a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.261" offset="5696449">Now, their reply brief which was just served on us Monday, and I'd like to take this point to answer one or two things in this reply brief that I think are outside of the records and are incorrect and in which the company is going to deny and I think these points out the danger of permitting a case that was not presented to the case -- the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.948" offset="5791117">It's not the record in this case to be first tried in this Court for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.029" offset="5811493">I'm referring of course to the state court case that was not in the record, was not discussed at all in the briefs before the District Court or the Circuit Court of Appeals but in the first time, we have that -- that this Court has the case on an appendix by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.038" offset="5883486">And now in a reply brief, we're going to get in a controversy of facts because they (Inaudible) in this reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.675" offset="5914102">And this is obviously to get around this tolling proposition and they admitted that they didn't bring their first action till eight months after the cause of action arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.896" offset="5963003">They omit that two places in their brief in which they say at the page 3 of their brief, in giving you the facts they say this, that on Jan -- Jan -- at page 3 on June the 1st, 1953, the company terminated the employment of more than a hundred workers whose deployment and vacation pay were controlled by the union company agreement of 1955 but the company did not at that time or thereafter pay to the terminated employees their accumulated vacation pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.405" offset="6105004">Then they say, “Eight months after this refusal to honor the agreement on February 21, 1958, the union of companies filed a suite.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.091" offset="6143770">Now in their reply brief they say, “The company finally ceased Evansville production operations covered by the contract with the union on June the 28th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.708" offset="6190164">Its workforce was thereupon disbanded and operating officials left the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.051" offset="6207613">At a meeting on June the 25th, 1925, the company assured you that it would grant the vacation pay and would issue checks in the following January.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.900" offset="6242931">However, when a group of employees went to the premises on January the 2nd, they were informed that the company was not in operation and no payment would be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.419" offset="6277099">Thus, when the company made -- manifest its violation of contract in January and had ceased its operations for six month the suit was brought in February.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.457" offset="6309177">Now that we deny that that statement was ever made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.476" offset="6325269">That's going outside the record again and I wanted Your Honors to know our position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.870" offset="6350869">And we think it's brought in there and it's a direct conflict with what is previously alleged that the cause of action arose in June and they admit they didn't -- they waited eight months after the cause of action arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.440" offset="6397158">Now, they're trying to get the cause of action arose about a month before the recent file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.049" offset="6415548">We say that's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.026" offset="6423489">Also, I might point out that they don't point out in the brief, they've make a point that a receivership was asked for this company and a footnote in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.127" offset="6455881">But they conveniently omit at the trial court -- denied the application for a receivership to this company shortly after the case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.433" offset="6497155">I want to just make those two points and still argue that on -- under the theory of matters there's a serious jurisdiction of question here whether this Court can recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.600" offset="6541772">Now, they say, “We went outside of the record”, that's another charge I'd like to repute.They say, “We are bringing it something in and out of the record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.413" offset="6576985">The record shows that -- and this is what we said in our brief, “We say no reference in the -- is in the record that appellant -- petitioner in this case filed a grievance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.120" offset="6615855">We didn't go outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.348" offset="6620766">We said it in this case, "The record doesn't show and the complaint does allege of performance of a condition preceding or that a grievance was filed."</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.221" offset="6660263">So we think that on that question, we have a valid jurisdictional question here that should be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.440" offset="6701119">Now, I'm getting to this question and I suppose this is the main issue in this case, is to whether or not this Court should adopt standards -- judicially adopt the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.018" offset="6763395">We submit to Your Honors that this petitioner is really asking this Court to assume some terrific burdens here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.449" offset="6793174">They not only want you to adopt, judicially adopt statutes of limitations for these national labor relations cases, they want you to go on the various categories and pick out the different types of action and adopt different formulations as to the standard there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.808" offset="6862555">Further, they want you to adopt a formulation standard under the theory of the Burnett case that will toll the statutes in this case so they can effectively get in court under -- whatever theory that Your Honors adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.323" offset="6912711">And I submit that it's -- asking quite a burden to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.143" offset="6927966">I ask you to go into that in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.958" offset="6935176">Now getting back to this main question, that if the state -- whether the state statute of limitations should be applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.753" offset="6966418">Your Honors, of course your familiar with the well-established rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.816" offset="6978644">Its been many times decided in this case -- Court that where the federal statute does not contain a limitation of time limitation that historically you follow the state rules but -- of the limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.456" offset="7041233">Now, that's based on the rules of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.386" offset="7052936">The early case, it was first decided in 1830 in McCluny versus Silliman but the really the Keystone case, I think, was the Campbell versus Haverhill and that was a patent case in 1894.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.008" offset="7115421">And I just like to quote one thing from Judge Brown who decided that case said at page 618, “The truth is that statute of limitations affect the remedy only and do not impair the right and that the settle policy of Congress has been to permit rights created by its statutes to be enforced in the manner and subject to the limitations prescribed by the laws of the several states."</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.419" offset="7217089">Now, Judge Brown gave some reasons for that which I think are applicable here and which I like to call Your Honors' attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.233" offset="7244257">It would be an anomaly it said, for Congress to create a right without a limitation and intended no limitations should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.420" offset="7277066">In other words he says, “Congress wouldn't pass a law, not put a limitation and expect that it would never -- that the statute would never be barred.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.908" offset="7311026">So therefore, Congress indented that it -- they didn't put something in the Act that the state law would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.389" offset="7340910">He also pointed out that it would be discriminatory if for the same set of facts under a state law that the head of state statute of limitations would apply to a litigant but if it was brought under a federal law for the same set of facts, there'd be no limitation that would apply to the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.741" offset="7418337">So they say, “That would be discriminatory” and that's another reason Congress did not intend for that to happen but that permitted the courts to look for the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.771" offset="7458461">Now, in this case, Congress obviously has -- is cognizant of the fact that in 301 actions, 303 action, they didn't put a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.403" offset="7509034">In many of this other federal acts that did not have statute of limitations such as the Patent Act, the Antitrust Act, Congress did go back later on and put in a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.334" offset="7552711">It took Congress 40 years to get around in putting the statute of limitations in the antitrust laws but they finally did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.346" offset="7580714">But during that interim, federal courts seemed to get along alright applying the state statute of limitations and I'm sure they'll continue to do that in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.338" offset="7620733">And now, why would you use the statute of limitations?</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.500" offset="7637347">We say it's the local contexts that were really covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.934" offset="7655111">Now here in this case, the plant is in Indiana, the employees are in Indiana, the logical place that they had bring the suit in federal court would be in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.825" offset="7694712">In the Cope (Inaudible) -- Cope-Anderson case as Justice Black said in that case, “Moreover, limitations are federally created rights to sue -- to have -- similarly been construed to be governed by limitation laws of the state where the crucial culmination of events transpired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.879" offset="7782902">Here the crucial common -- basing -- involved events transpired in Indiana, the plant is there, the employees are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.580" offset="7805680">In any of these labor cases where they talked about a need for a national uniformity, the plants where this men worked, that's where they're going to bring the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.998" offset="7851342">And if they should bring it to some other state, no doubt the federal court might send it back to the local scene were the breach occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.881" offset="7882898">So we say that there is no reason why this Court should abandon its well established law that the state laws applied where the federal courts do not contain the limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.545" offset="7937546">As a matter of fact, this very question has been raised in several -- in two cases involving the 303 in United Mine Workers versus Meadowcreek Coal, a Sixth Circuit case and the International Operating Union versus Fischbach and Moore, the key -- that question was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.552" offset="8009540">They both applied the state statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.188" offset="8024168">Although in the Fischbach case the court said, they thought a six months statute should apply which I will go into later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.000" offset="8051336">But they -- they've felt like this -- the six months statute which is contained in Section 10 (b) of the Act were unfair labor practices should apply in this kind of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.396" offset="8100968">But they said were bound by the well-established rules that we have to apply state law and they applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.274" offset="8124479">In two cases involving the 301 actions, the Reliford versus Eastern Coal, another Sixth Circuit and Tully versus Fred Olson Motors, case decided (Inaudible) Wisconsin Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.337" offset="8172753">Incidentally, both those cases held that the state law applied in this very question raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.718" offset="8202219">In the last case, the judge there also thought that the six months statute applied but felt -- and the District Court so held but the Supreme Court of Wisconsin holding that under this well-established rule reversed them and said that the state court limitation could apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.585" offset="8269720">This rule had been applied in many other federal statutes that do not have limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.235" offset="8288319">The courts have gotten along fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.107" offset="8295842">I don't think it's -- and the union is -- the petitioner has made quite a -- explained that because this labor law and in certain cases Your Honors have expressed that it should have a uniform application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.784" offset="8346520">I say that this rule doesn't do violence to that because here, you can have a uniform application as to the meaning of the contract and that particular matters but that doesn't mean that that would have necessary fall that you'd have to have a uniform limitations unless Congress put it in their.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.688" offset="8422170">I think it's desirable that probably there should be a limitation in the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.417" offset="8445053">But I think it's for Congress to decide after hearings and so forth to decide, what is the proper act -- statute of limitations and I certainly would reject the petitioner's suggestion that they ought to be four or five different limitations for actions under 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.127" offset="8511927">There should be -- I think the 6-month statute which I will next address myself to, the -- assuming just -- that this Court should adopt the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.068" offset="8559679">That -- I -- in my opinion, it would almost follow, that it should be the 6-month statute set out in 10 (b) of the Act which is provided for unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.899" offset="8607013">Now, petitioner would admit that the six months would be alright on the 303 action but there is where the -- the company has to sue a union for secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.718" offset="8658213">Now, the union in that case would like quick action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.209" offset="8668244">They want the employer to sue six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.023" offset="8679424">But if -- it turned around, there go to sue the company, the union would suggest six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.332" offset="8704711">I think to be consistent and it was pointed out in the International versus Fischbach, that court went into this question very carefully as to whether the 6-month statute apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.824" offset="8750686">That was a 303 action for a secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.781" offset="8766464">They said he thought that six months statute should apply and he gave the congressional history where Mr. -- Senator Taft couldn't separate the various sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.654" offset="8810036">It's all under one Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.637" offset="8817873">And in one Section they have this 60 -- this six months limitation but in the 301 Section they don't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.954" offset="8851205">But he points out that in many, many cases, an action under 301, just like in the Smith case, can also be an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.417" offset="8897076">And the u -- and the board -- if the board wanted to prosecute that action against the company for an unfair labor practice they would have been bound by the 6-month statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.471" offset="8933230">But you can go into the court and there is no statute and we say that to be consistent and to carry out this uniform law then, if the court adopts anything it should adopt the 6-month statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.983" offset="8987355">And in that case under any theory, the petitioner could not recover in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.586" offset="9009716">Now, getting to this question and incidentally I think Your Honor answers Mr. Justice Brennan's question awhile ago that whether or not there is any place you could draw from or a source of creating a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.259" offset="9072410">We think it's a perfect example of -- when you were talking -- the McAllister case that here is a six-month statute in this very Act applying to a different section but overlapping and in many cases on the identical facts we think that's an obvious source for it if this Court feels it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.663" offset="9150046">My suggestion is to the court and I'm sure the court would not unnecessarily assume lot of burdens of trying to pick out which statutes would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.391" offset="9192887">That if you do decide you need to make a formulation that six months period isn't correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.537" offset="9217546">Now getting to this tolling question because --Suppose the --</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.690" offset="9598098">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.050" offset="9599561">They have special statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.478" offset="9605308">We've set about in our appendix to our brief, these penalty statutes of Indiana in which they say that you have to pay the employee's wages within ten days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.865" offset="9646791">If you do not pay within ten days after the demand, then he is entitled to a dollar a day damages for each day that you refuse to pay him until it reaches double the amount of the pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.163" offset="9696005">And then there -- he's entitled to double damages and he's also entitled to statutory attorney fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.016" offset="9719411">And that's exactly what the petitioner is seeking to recover in this case, that's why we think when he says this an action exclusively on this written labor contract it just can't be if you read his complaint because on the very first page of -- the very first of his complaint he sets out the sta -- the -- these Indiana statutes on which he's recovering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.018" offset="9819408">I've set it out on page 11 of my brief because we think it's so pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.656" offset="9841977">Paragraph 10, that pursuant to the Acts, they generally assume the State of Indiana of the year 1911 Chapter 68 and of -- for thereof and in accordance with the Acts of the General Assembly for the year 1933, Chapter 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.637" offset="9901955">There is due the employees represented by the claim, an amount equal the double unpaid wages which amount is in excess of $80,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.866" offset="9934869">Therefore, the plaintiff asked judgment against the defendant corporation in the amount of $40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.086" offset="9959737">Now, that's the amount of wages which that would be the claim and the only claim he would have under the so-called written contract he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.385" offset="9992861">But, they go further together with liquidated damages in the amount of $80,000 together with the reasonable attorney -- for plaintiffs' attorneys and such other relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.541" offset="10037582">So you see his whole case when he argued that this is bottomed squarely on the written collective bargaining agreement that under the decision of this Court in Smith that you got to apply a 20-year statute of limitation falls on the very weight of his own complaint in which he is relying desperately on the Indiana statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.539" offset="10117517">As a matter of fact, he wants to recover more under this Indiana family statutes than he does on the primary cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.813" offset="10382608">Now, the other action Your Honor as we -- we think the lower court correctly decided under a series of Indiana cases that the 6-year statute applied because this contract was partially oral and partially in the writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.879" offset="10442898">Now, were not suggesting to the Court that is the basis of this action, I'm going to have to rely upon this union contract to certain extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.172" offset="10472051">But it's like any contract that is partially in oral a partial in writing under a statute of limitations law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.319" offset="10500681">They say that unless you can take the whole contract -- the whole law suit -- frankly, from the four corners of the contract that you have to resort to parole evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.130" offset="10543940">And if you had to resort to parole evidence then that is the same as if it was the contract not in writing so far as statutes of limitations are concern and you apply in Indiana the six years statute of limitations for a contract not in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.016" offset="10603395">I think Your Honors, I might out this one, I think there's a misconception that this question of parole evidence, parole evidence means extrinsic evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.872" offset="10646862">It does not (Inaudible) -- it does not necessarily mean a verbal testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.161" offset="10676015">In other words, and the reason I make this point is that in the reply brief that suggested, “Well, you didn't need anything here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.843" offset="10710706">We could prove this written -- we could prove the employment relationship here by the payroll records.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.319" offset="10748635">That under Indiana law and under well established law is extrinsic or parole evidence which brings it squarely within the statutes of limitation where they say if a contract is partially paroled and partially in writing this oral statute or rule statute of limitations applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.640" offset="10821883">Indiana says, “Contracts not in writing”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.199" offset="10832123">So we -- I want to make that point that there is a difference that parole evidence does not necessarily mean verbal testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.887" offset="10862947">It means any extrinsic evidence that you have to introduce on a court to make out to your law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.872" offset="10886875">Now, if he says this is exclusively on a written contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.974" offset="10903280">He carries that written contract and quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.268" offset="10912475">He's going to have to introduce payroll records or something but we go one step further in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.450" offset="10933164">We have an affidavit that they were no written contracts whatever with these employees that they were all -- employed under a verbal oral contract and that was not contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.054" offset="10975587">They're controverted, although the plaintiff or the petitioner had the right to do so, an -- in the -- at the court below in our motion if they wanted to controvert that so, you had to take that that in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.081" offset="11027728">Now some cases, there may be cases where an employee signs up a written contract and there -- and incorporates the terms that this were the written -- the 20-year statute of Indiana could apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.888" offset="11082898">But this is not such a case as shown by the record here because their affidavit shows that this were oral verbal contracts and not written contracts of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.183" offset="11128142">And you've got to create the employment relationship before there can be an action on the contract itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.691" offset="12102092">Now, in my few remaining minutes, I'd like to address myself to these tolling questions which on any statute which the Court would have say is more than six months, the petitioners would seek to avoid the influence of any statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.528" offset="12181504">We say first that this case of Johnson versus Hoosier Cardinal should not even be considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.660" offset="12214000">It was not in the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.335" offset="12224763">We've already point out the dangers of considering the case of this point because here we're getting in a dispute even before this Court on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.819" offset="12266663">We deny some of the charges made in this reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.206" offset="12284217">So that's one good reason sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.928" offset="12291114">And I think this Court's precedent had said if the case, the point hasn't been raised below, it should be raised -- it could not be raised here for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.780" offset="12326536">And certainly he says, “Well, it wouldn't have done us any good but I don't know how anybody can tell what effect it might have had had that been an issue in it, although, I do not think under the facts in that Burnett case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.349" offset="12376795">The facts here, it would have been applicable at all."</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.684" offset="12386095">I don't think as Mr. Chief Justice Fortas has suggested, I don't think there's going to be any excuse for that almost a year, 11 and a half months, between the time that the filed decision in the state court was rendered and this suit were filed in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.700" offset="12462164">I think that's a delay that's -- that they're never going to be able to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.361" offset="12480867">Also there -- and as I pointed out, there was an eight months delay in filing even in the original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.687" offset="12506154">So you got two years of delays into that -- therefore, he suggested that anything less than two years would be tolled but we say that that action should not apply at all and that we have shown in our brief the reasons why the Burnett case should not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.709" offset="12998196">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.434" offset="13005093">I shall not trespass on the Court's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.192" offset="13016168">I do think that the argument of my distinguished opponent underlines the complexities of local law that we've been to this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.113" offset="13051800">His very explication of the Indiana law that a written collective bargaining agreement because proof to show who the people covered by the agreement may be needed from outside sources unless the collective bargaining agreement and the written agreement of hire or one document is anachronistic, I say, and it shows the troubles we get into in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.252" offset="13148348">I would like to say a word about the -- a word more about the 10 (b) problem, the 6-month statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.082" offset="13175724">I think this Court by implication in Smith against The Evening News rejected for the six months 10 (b) statute of the unfair labor practices sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.798" offset="13218565">I note that in Footnote 5 on page 198 of Smith against The Evening News, this Court noted that that suit which involved the unfair labor practice was not brought within the six months period of the labor board's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.093" offset="13291708">Now, I think there is no more reason for this Court to adopt the six months statute on contract actions than there is for it to allow preemption of the Labor Board in contract actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.128" offset="13335907">I do think that the reason for the 6-month statute and unfair labor practices, it is well-grounded in public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.601" offset="13365791">They are in the nature of toward actions in most cases and the witnesses should be gotten fast and the investigation by the administrative bodies should be completed in a hurry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.483" offset="13409259">But sometimes and I do not wish to get in to an argument with my opponent in an unseemly argument on the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.998" offset="13435382">But I say that sometimes we have to -- we -- in written contracts we know what we're doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.204" offset="13468191">When we have a defense like the Republic against Maddox raised here and I do think that case is good and right but if were raised below there may be a reason why the agreements procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.886" offset="13506957">I don't want to argue about the facts but I'm sure that there needs to be development of the reasons why the agreements procedure wasn't used -- if it wasn't used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.225" offset="13540289">And I do represent to the Court that the non-record facts that we mentioned in connection with the Republic against Maddox argument are based entirely on notes which we received from union representatives who were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.287" offset="13588564">Now, I don't know if they're accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.962" offset="13595251">I can't test to that but I can only say that this kind of issue needs to be developed.</text>
