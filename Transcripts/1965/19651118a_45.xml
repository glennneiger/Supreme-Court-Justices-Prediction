            <label>Mr. Donald F. Welday</label>
            <text syncTime="103.718" offset="518248">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, may it please this honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.917" offset="563075">We present a case wherein -- as we have recited the issue, there seems to be some difference of opinion as to what the actual issue is in this case between our position, the position of the respondents and that of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.671" offset="646040">But we think that we have accurately phrased it, when we said that has Congress in enacting the National Labor Relations Act exempted from the jurisdiction of the state courts, all rights and all remedies in the case of nonviolent tortuous conduct even though there maybe -- committed even though there maybe some kind of a labor dispute or relations or incident involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.909" offset="807058">Has it been the intent of Congress to deprive an individual of his right of action for tortuous conduct committed against him in the state courts or in this case, a federal court because of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.298" offset="884590">The facts, on December the 7th, 1962, Mr. Linn who is the petitioner here, was an Assistant Regional Manager for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.277" offset="944462">And he had under his -- or in his area the Detroit, Michigan area, and on that date, December 7, 1962, a leaflet was published and delivered to various employees of the Detroit office of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.170" offset="1040071">In that leaflet, Mr. Linn was expressly referred to by a name, described as a manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.171" offset="1076015">Also in that leaflet, it was said that the Pinkerton managers have been lying, have been cheating, have been robbing, and perhaps maybe subject to criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.591" offset="1149785">There was no Labor Relations matter, no labor dispute, and no incident up to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.521" offset="1189491">One year previously, on the 7th of December in 1961, there had been a certification election for the Pinkerton employees in the Detroit office -- the bargaining agent which had represented those employees up to that point was voted out.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.600" offset="1289801">So on December the 7th, 1962, when this leaflet was published, there was no problem, there was no dispute, and there was no incident.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.338" offset="1656769">Now the petitioner did not, of course, he is an intermediate supervisor employee of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, the respondents here are that group which apparently sought to represent the guard employees of the Pinkerton Detective Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.456" offset="1741197">But the Pinkerton agency filed an unfair labor charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.378" offset="3020884">But nevertheless they were brought to the attention of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.653" offset="3033945">Also, a motion was made to the District Court to dismiss the petitioner's action on the now familiar Garmon language that if an activity is arguably subject to Section 7 or 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, it is preempted to the National Labor Relations Board and the local courts would have no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.449" offset="3125164">And it was specifically, on that ground, that the District Court dismissed the petitioner's complaint was no hearing was ever held before the National Labor Relations Board or before the District Court the truth of falsity of the allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.847" offset="3206771">The libelous material has never been gone into.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.635" offset="5433866">The upshot of the District Court's position left this plaintiff in a position where he felt that he had been libel with malice grievously and there was absolutely nothing that he, as an individual, could do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.918" offset="5543058">The Court said that under Garmon, the Court can't do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.847" offset="5570748">The National Labor Relations Board wouldn't hear the complaint of this petitioner's employer and we point out that even if they had agreed to hear it, there wasn't a thing that the National Labor Relations Board could do under any circumstances to restore this citizen and this individual to a position where he would have been before he suffered a personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.125" offset="5687881">And we submit that libel is a personal injury, that it's a serious one, and that it's a grievous one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.677" offset="5722049">The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's action specifically on this Court's opinion in Garmon and pointed out the interesting proposition, as the Sixth Circuit interpreted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.667" offset="5834062">Garmon says, an individual might quickly recover from the -- I interpolate somewhat, an individual might quickly recover from the bruises and wounds of a physical assault and that little expense have a crimpled fender bumped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.473" offset="5893308">But a lifetime may not be sufficient to restore a reputation hurt by the circulation of a vicious libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.918" offset="5919013">We are persuaded however, that Garmon has drawn the distinction which permits the one to be remedied by traditional court action and limits the other to the relief, if any, that may come from an order of the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.877" offset="5970840">And if a regional director's refusal to issue a complaint is sustained, the libeled individual is at the end of the remedial role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.951" offset="6011173">Mr. Linn is at the end of the remedial role under this interpretation of Garmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.767" offset="6034474">Very frankly, Mr. Linn doesn't like that situation and he feels that there must be some place where the truth can be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.264" offset="6080449">Is Mr. Linn a crook and is he a liar, and is he a thief?</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.928" offset="6099048">Does he have to go through life because of National Labor policy branded this way?</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.936" offset="6127156">Or may he not, in a court of competent jurisdiction refute these allegations, and may he not clear his name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.198" offset="6176162">We think that in some respects, this case raises the issue which was suggested and foretold in the concurring opinion in Garmon and also suggested in Mr. Justice Douglas' dissent in the Borden case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.296" offset="6240528">That is, has Congress prevented a resolution by the courts, what is essentially a private dispute, a personal injury tort?</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.238" offset="6276368">When that dispute incidentally arises during the course of what might be called the labor relations incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.087" offset="6311685">When we say it might be called a labor relations incident, because in this case particularly, there was no incident, there was no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.974" offset="6339271">There was nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.996" offset="6351391">People went to work and all of a sudden, there was a circular distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.450" offset="6381171">Curiously enough by following Garmon, the national policy which we think is to promote the peaceful settlement of labor problems if we promote or if we allow Garmon, the interpretation of Garmon that was attached by the lower courts in this case, then we've created the dispute where none existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.938" offset="6483153">If we say that libel is an activity which nothing -- no court can remedy, which no court can hear and the National Labor Relations Board maybe might do something about it, then in effect, we give a license to libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.412" offset="6557027">We create disputes and we think in some respects that the position of the respondents here isn't asking for a license to libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.062" offset="6603630">Because the practical issue has to be faced that no order of the National Labor Relations Board could do anything about can possibly correct or stop that pass line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.905" offset="6659009">Ultimately, it may say don't ever libel again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.154" offset="6667995">Don't ever defame again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.421" offset="6677086">But it can't do anything about what has transpired in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.273" offset="6688475">And we think this is a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.504" offset="6693386">We think this creates a dispute where none has existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.804" offset="6726614">The answer to whether or not libel may be prosecuted even though there is a labor incident attached to it, the answer to that question, we think, comes from the dissenting opinion of the Chief Justice in the Russell case, commenting on the Laburnum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.758" offset="6850435">Laburnum simply holds that a tort-feasor should not be allowed to immunize himself from liability for a wrong having no relation to federal law simply because the means he adopts to affect the wrong, transgresses a comprehensive code of federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.165" offset="6920025">And that I think in a nutshell is the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.640" offset="6937893">The tort-feasor has committed a wrong which incidentally is involved with the National Labor Relations Act, the National Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.586" offset="7025768">But otherwise, it has no connection to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.648" offset="7037994">It's essentially a private dispute between Linn on the one hand and those people who happened to be connected with a labor union on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.620" offset="7089821">I think there is no possibility of a competition between the courts in this matter and the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.046" offset="7123571">They're looking for two separate and distinct approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.466" offset="7145200">The Board's approach is, does a given circumstance, does a given incident, is it coercive?</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.554" offset="7181563">Not truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.746" offset="7190340">That's not the issue before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.839" offset="7198699">Is it coercive?</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.741" offset="7210297">The court is concerned with the truth regardless of whether it is coercive or not coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.154" offset="7232031">It makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.365" offset="7240808">These two tribunals then are looking in different directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.983" offset="7259303">They can decide these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.652" offset="7265991">They can hear these issues without any relationship to each other, without any competition between each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.882" offset="7298905">And if the problem, if the reason for the preemption doctrine of Garmon which is what has controlled this case so far is a prevention of competition between the national policy and the various substantive laws and modes of regulation of the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.202" offset="7376227">That competition problem is not present under this set of circumstances because the tribunals are not looking towards the same answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.307" offset="7472567">The Fourth Circuit, in the Bouligny case which we understand is before this Court but on another question, but the Fourth Circuit summed up we think, the whole proposition in one neat little sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.152" offset="7535992">The question before it in part was the jurisdiction of a Court to hear a libel permit or committed in the course of some kind of a labor incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.585" offset="7589700">And the Fourth Circuit said the National Labor Relations Act is concerned only with the coercive effect and it is not concerned at all with the effect of libel as a common law tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.070" offset="7627630">That's what we're concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.126" offset="7635884">And Mr. Linn says, this petitioner says, can I clear my name?</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.801" offset="7658559">Can I have this matter heard?</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.521" offset="7665455">I don't think it is any answer to say but the matter will still be heard in relation to the remaining defendant Doyle because, if we go back to the District Court and we try the matter insofar as Doyle is concerned and if we prove everything which we have alleged in our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.654" offset="7734000">And this case is the -- the decisions are allowed to stand as they are up to this point, then we approve the complete defense of Mr. Doyle because he's a part and parcel of the Union and he is in concert with him and Garmon would preempt the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.275" offset="7788440">So it is no answer to say that the matter still remains viable insofar as Doyle is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.150" offset="9691930">Which substantial sums have been sought in defamation suits growing out of statements made doing labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.610" offset="9725785">Now this will give you an idea of importance of the issue because these suits seem to be a relatively new phenomenon in racial -- I mean in labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.028" offset="9767476">But that tendency to discourage vigorous organizational campaigns is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.505" offset="9793390">Significantly many of these suits set out in our appendix involve words which although probably defamatory under traditional criteria of libel and slander cases, nevertheless cannot fairly be said seriously to injure the reputation of the parties to a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.143" offset="9871966">Claims that an employer is unfair or that is using the big live tactics of Hitler, or then an employee is by hiding tax, and draw him into driveway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.048" offset="9919613">Let me point out, that most American jurisdiction, the law of defamation is quite strict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.264" offset="9948453">Casual use of the words like liar or cheat, or unfair may expose one to heavy general damages, even though actual injury to one's pocket book may not be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.112" offset="9995786">It is the Board and this Court has recognized Union organizing campaigns tend to be heated affairs in which the participants would get themselves and speak intemperately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.029" offset="10043538">Indeed, I imagine some of us know some labor leaders that if you prevent him from cursing, you take all that free speech away from them and a negotiation that goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.754" offset="10090350">And it's recognized its feelings run high rough languages not in frequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.008" offset="10111352">Such campaigns of organizing in a labor dispute, they're not conducted in the language of the college classroom or the drawing room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.870" offset="10154820">Words and other context might constitute serious insults are generally viewed by the participants in labor disputes as no more than ordinary rough and tumbled organizing tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.989" offset="10203303">Unfortunately, many courts apparently have not recognized this fact of industrialized so that if the courts were permitted to apply the traditional strict standards governing what is defamatory to statements made during union organizing campaigns and the same measure of damages were applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.992" offset="10287313">Many of the typical comments invariably and inevitably uttered during such campaigns could subject the speaker to very heavy damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.136" offset="10327960">To impose strict defamation liability of the participants in such campaigns could thus throw a real monkey wrench in to the scheme of National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.812" offset="10374666">Instead of the parties to the dispute being able to talk out and indeed curse out their differences in a board supervised campaign and election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.585" offset="10409671">The dispute would in effect be dragged into the courts to be fought out as any other defamation action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.934" offset="10439137">This would be most disruptive, further it's unnecessary because the kind of abuse that might in other context cause real harm or ordinarily be discounted were made by a party on the other side of a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.392" offset="10508936">We say then that the policy and integrity of the federal labor scheme simply cannot count on its unlimited liability for defamations arising from Union organizational efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.567" offset="10569644">The unbridle existence of the threat of heavy damage of words but defamation added during the cause of union organizing campaign would have to say the least of killing effect upon the freedom of communication that is so necessary to the exercise of the employee's statutory right under Section 7 of the Act to bargain collectively, to represent it as of their own choosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.139" offset="10679881">Union organizers would be most reluctant to speak out freely and inevitably if they knew that words which a customary employee in such campaigns, well it might seem defamatory to persons not familiar with the actual conduct of labor disputes or to judges and juries hustle to the goals of the Union could subject them to heavy damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.998" offset="10775385">The probable effect of permitting such suits would therefore be to tort the effective exercise of these granted statutory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.772" offset="10822510">But we also think that there's an area in which the State would be able to grant a remedy for defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.817" offset="10846647">After all, the States traditionally have had a strong interest in protecting reputation and in awarding damages for injuries thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.946" offset="10887189">And therefore, we think the federal scheme should be viewed as displacing the same state authority in this area only to the extent necessary to protect the federal scheme of labor relations throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.508" offset="10957406">There are some kinds of defamation which are so harmful and unjustifiable that the State interest in that suppression is compelling and as to which suppression would involve no appreciable danger of serious interference with federal labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.434" offset="11033057">State power of such defamation is needed not and should not be deemed preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.469" offset="13445204">The state laws on libel, slander of course very strict yet bare this in mind that whereas in the violence cases, if the man sues for damages for assault and battery and the jury is a rather hostile jury to labor unions and they're bringing an outlandish verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.033" offset="13551470">The judge can very clearly set that aside because there are certain guidelines about a broken eye or broken arm.</text>

            <text syncTime="3386.555" offset="13649586">And we therefore think that in this is a more important area to keep away from the state courts as much as we can and at the same time, leave the state what it needs to maintain its peace in good order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.739" offset="13714369">And at the same time, it's in keeping with the national policy of the NLRB as I see it that in this freedom of speech, it not go beyond certain limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3968.293" offset="15976573">We would define the issue in the following terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.976" offset="15995277">Shall a further exception to the preemption doctrine stated in San Diego Building Trades versus Garmon be made in cases of claim defamation uttered in the context of a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.487" offset="16065285">Respondents urge that no such exception should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.707" offset="16082213">It is not necessary nor even desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.361" offset="16100812">On the other hand, any such exception would create havoc and confusion in this area which has so many times been described as an area of delicate balance between the competing interest of the federal government and our National Labor policy and those of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.351" offset="16180746">We believe the exception urged by respondent would destroy the effect of Garmon which has been so successfully followed by the lower courts since its decision in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.768" offset="16262457">The exception proposed by respondent would open a wide area of conflict between the federal labor policy and the policy of the 50 different states relating to defamatory statements in this labor relations field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.087" offset="16327764">Respondents cannot accept either as workable, the limited exception proposed by the government in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.258" offset="16380426">Respondents assert in its brief that Garmon was not the end of the preemption road.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.836" offset="16406758">Respondents believe it was, is, or should be the end of the preemption road.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.836" offset="16438732">I think just a brief review of the background of all of the preemption cases that gave rise to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's decision in Garmon would throw a light on the reason Garmon -- the Garmon rule was enunciated and the reason it has proved so workable since that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.832" offset="16542699">Mr. Justice Frankfurter noted that the preemption issue there was a variant of a familiar field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.428" offset="16577076">The notes that preemption began with Allen Bradley versus Wisconsin Board and was greatly intensified by litigation which flew from the enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.683" offset="16626082">And the preemption issue was brought before this Court in almost a score of cases during the decade immediately preceding the Garmon decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.832" offset="16674670">Thus there were a large number of cases stating specific areas of preemption and also delimiting state areas of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.117" offset="16727855">The titles and propositions of these cases are familiar to every labor law practitioner and I'm sure to this Court Hill versus Florida, UAW versus O' Brien, Garner versus Teamsters, Weber versus Anhieser Bush, and a host of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.185" offset="16800162">Now in the Garmon decision, Mr. Justice Frankfurter hold together this almost score of preemption cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.014" offset="16835480">He reconciled them and concluded that over the years, a clear pattern had evolved from the previous decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.732" offset="16874350">And he stated that this -- that with Garmon, with the decision in Garmon, it may safely be claimed that this long series of adjudications have hope translated into concreteness, be consistently applied principles which decide this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.033" offset="16947493">What was the clear pattern?</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.386" offset="16956897">The familiar test of an activity that is arguably subject to Section 7 or Section 8 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.749" offset="16994408">This clear pattern recognized only two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.940" offset="17015097">One, the -– then just preceding decision in the Gonzales case relating matters of peripheral concern, the other was in those cases which touched so deeply and local feelings that state should be allowed to intervene i.e. conduct marked by violence and eminent press of the public court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.271" offset="17112482">It's a very simple rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.982" offset="17123349">It has proved very workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.774" offset="17146441">To use a colloquial expression was the greatest thing since the bow and arrow to practitioners in the field and to the judges of the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.432" offset="17193148">I think only a review of all of the cases pending in the lower court on this subject in this area of libel showed that the federal court would -- or the federal courts and the state courts, the judges that have been called upon to decide where their libel and slander occurring in a labor dispute is preempted by Garmon almost unanimously hold in applying Garmon that it is preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="4378.884" offset="17618944">That is correct but I would not -- I would not say that such would be preempted by Garmon because of the distinctions which I have just stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.209" offset="17672234">The substance of this point is that the trial judges at all level understand Garmon and they know how to apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.815" offset="17718627">And without exception, when they do apply it they hold that Garmon preempts all activity or conduct that does not involve violence or eminent threats to the public peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.237" offset="17776306">Let's say the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in the Myer's decision however held that Garmon did not apply to this type of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.905" offset="17807026">On the other hand the Supreme Courts of Arizona and Alaska had held Garmon applied to this type of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.337" offset="17844746">As the district judge in this case had no trouble in applying Garmon finding preemption, the Court of Appeals likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.170" offset="17884035">I don't believe that anyone, any party can seriously dispute that Garmon is the case to be considered in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.531" offset="17933458">So the first question is the activity of Mr. Doyle arguably protected by Section 7 are prohibited by Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.490" offset="17981315">I believe this point is so clear that it does not require any extended discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.586" offset="18001690">Here was an employee appealing to fellow employees to support the Union, to support self organizational efforts during an organizing campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.534" offset="18041501">The statements were certainly relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.498" offset="18057383">The petitioner never really challenged that it was not protected or prohibited until filing a brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.173" offset="18084028">The government concedes that if Garmon applies, the statements would be protected under Section 7 of the Act because if the statements were true, then clearly such statements would be protected, therefore, it is arguably so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.317" offset="18156648">We further submit that the trial court which made the statement that it was prohibited by Section 8 was also correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.954" offset="18187160">It could arguably be prohibited by Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.176" offset="18200116">The petitioners recognized this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.687" offset="18210147">I should I say the petitioners but the petitioner's employer recognized this by filing a charge before the National Labor Relations Board alleging a violation of Section 8(b) 1(a) which is the section prohibiting a union or others from interfering with restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.312" offset="18320593">The other point which must be considered --</text>

            <text syncTime="4558.281" offset="18336475">Excuse me, this is your point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.137" offset="18343894">That you are suggesting that the bringing of this suit violates the Labor Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="4565.380" offset="18364897">No sir but I do suggest that as another part of the argument that in many instances, the institution of a libel suit such as this suit may violate the Act because it may have a coercive effect upon a union's organizational right or during the course of the labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.155" offset="18459982">A small union with very limited funds that is faced with a -- half a million or a million dollar lawsuit such as in this case may very well conclude that it will bargain away any right to organize the employees for the company dropping the lawsuit or dismissing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.441" offset="18545142">It may also scare the employees to where they will be afraid to engage in any activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.003" offset="18571368">And I might say -- state this parenthetically -- earlier Mr. Doyle mentioned quite frequently, he apparently still is in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.124" offset="18607835">Although this does not appear in the record, I thought it might be of some interest after the charge was filed and the suit was filed against him and he was served, he went back to England and has never returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.512" offset="18657468">I'm not saying that this may have been the result of the lawsuit but the fact is that it is mentioned so that it will explain why no further action has been taken with respect to Doyle in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.512" offset="18729462">I might add there too, this question has come up that I say no distinction between Doyle as an individual and the Union as an entity with respect to the protection from such suits because the employees of Section 7 have the right to engage in these activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.307" offset="18808560">Therefore there should be no distinction between the suit against the employee or the suit against the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.197" offset="18848162">Much is made in the brief of petitioner that there is a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.853" offset="18882748">There's such a compelling state interest and the respondent's conduct that the State should be free to interfere with the federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.058" offset="18923604">Again, the conduct of respondents, if true, was all concerned with an organizing guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.670" offset="18962056">I think that we should bear in mind that we are here today deciding this case on the basis of the facts in this case, not fact as suggested in the brief of the Solicitor General or the facts as suggested in briefs filed by other amicus curiae in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.537" offset="19061530">This is the run of the Mill case that comes along in a libel and slander situation in a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.906" offset="19099042">And I think it's helpful to believe at a point a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.647" offset="19113984">Petitioner was a resident and a citizen of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.339" offset="19132688">He wasn't even a citizen of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.149" offset="19152018">His only relationship to Michigan, it was one of several Northwestern states that he -- in which he exercised supervisory control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.280" offset="19184515">It's part of his duty to prevent and to resist the organizational efforts of his employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.172" offset="19212100">Part of his job, he is the manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.656" offset="19229968">He was an employee of Pinkerton and Doyle was an employee of Pinkerton.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.648" offset="19261942">And it was Doyle who wrote the letter to fellow employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.304" offset="19276570">It is rather crude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.682" offset="19286079">It doesn't even appear on union stationary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.357" offset="19300812">Very crude but it is not such as to shot conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.392" offset="19324949">I have seen and heard many worse statements that were contained in this leaflet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.503" offset="19357341">It does not even impute the commission of any specific crime other than the submission of false information to the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.792" offset="19398510">There is no hint of violence or threat to the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.884" offset="19418885">What overwriting state interest is involved then to justify Michigan taking this action away from the National Labor Relations Board?</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.117" offset="19455875">Petitioner's only answer is that the individual has an interest to protect his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.474" offset="19489311">And the government's answer is that the protection of a citizen against damage to its reputation is the traditional concern and responsibility of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.510" offset="19541452">Now the individual of course has an interest in this reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.616" offset="19557857">But just what interest does the State have?</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.996" offset="19567365">What compelling interest does a State have?</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.077" offset="19579695">The only conclusion that can be drawn is that the state's interest is the individual's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.463" offset="19609266">They're the same because there is no overwriting possibility of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.131" offset="19639881">Now of course, it has been suggested in one of the briefs or two that defamatory statements may tend to provoke a breach of the peace but there are no proofs to support this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.405" offset="19701008">At the point, defamation reaches the violent stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.855" offset="19718771">For example, defamatory words uttered on a picket line against non-obstructive has been held to constitute such eminent danger to the peace as to justify state interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.786" offset="19782510">The Youngdahl versus Rainfair, I think this was also involved in the Meadowmoor Dairies case, the earlier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.907" offset="19830993">And injunctions have been sustained against being calling as well as others.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.901" offset="19850951">So if defamation reaches the point that it constitutes a danger to the domestic peace, the States may act under the present Garmon rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.886" offset="19910928">I believe the dissenting opinion in the Myers case in Pennsylvania, sums up respondent's position better than I could rephrase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.378" offset="19964844">In view of the lack of authority for the proposition that the State's interest in defamation is as great as the State's interest in physical violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="6316.831" offset="25370728">A huge award against Mr. Doyle would mean that that policy could not be effectuated because Mr. Doyle would obviously quit his employment and go elsewhere or rather than to have his legs taken to satisfy a judgment with this employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6332.684" offset="25434154">This is where I see that the conflict, it prevents the Board from effectuating the National Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6340.883" offset="25466859">Another area of conflict is -- when NLRB holds an election and the Union should win in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.299" offset="25500609">And the employers move to set him aside on the basis of the leaflet.</text>
            <text syncTime="6353.824" offset="25518686">And NLRB finds this as merely permissible activity which indeed I think it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="6358.825" offset="25538644">And then a jury awards you to damages against the Union which far exceeds the facets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6367.828" offset="25574693">In this instance, the policies of the Act, that employees are to have complete freedom of choice in selecting their bargaining agent might be frustrated because the Union might abandon its efforts to represent the employees and go out of existence in order to satisfy in a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.594" offset="25669778">Huge or libel action seeking huge damages in effectively stipple the free exchange of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="6403.246" offset="25716381">I like the language used in the New York Times case, libel actions maybe used as a tool by which expression is repressed, if you think that applies with the libel actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="6725.160" offset="27004008">Frankly, on behalf of the petitioner, we could accept a test of malice or deliberate false suit insofar as allowing the state courts to retain jurisdiction is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="6866.508" offset="27569403">So if we let the labor board say whether or not it is arguably subject, I would think we'd have to say that the Labor Board must make that determination but it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6876.470" offset="27609213">The Garmon test actually provides three exceptions, one for violence, one for activities which are peripheral concerns of the Labor Management Act, and an exception in the case of compelling state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="6891.856" offset="27670758">The deliberate or malicious libel is much like violence in that it is an intentional means of destruction or something else now whether it happens to be a car or a building or an arm or a client relationship, or a reputation it still is an intentional destruction.</text>
