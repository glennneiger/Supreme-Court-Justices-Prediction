            <label>Mr. F. Conger Fawcett</label>
            <text syncTime="28.452" offset="219261">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.911" offset="237025">Before I begin my argument, I should like to call the Court's attention to a disparity in the record of this case as disclosed by their respective briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.666" offset="280074">In as much as I have no opportunity to discover this disparity until I received the Solicitor General's brief this weekend after I arrived in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.766" offset="324483">This is the first opportunity I've had to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.586" offset="339738">And I do, do so unless the Court think that simply because I took this case on court appointment, I have somehow been negligent either in carrying out my obligation to my appointed client or in presenting to this Court, to the best of my abilities, the true and full facts as I knew them.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.914" offset="437123">The discrepancy occurs in that while my knowledge of the case here and below has been predicated upon the official record.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.773" offset="468470">Certified first to the Court of Appeals and then here, the Solicitor General's brief makes suitable use of additional materials not a part of the official record on appeal, never made available to me until this past Saturday from the kindness of your clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.831" offset="544747">This is the material which the Solicitor General's brief refers to as “supplementary papers” in note one, page one of his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.407" offset="591036">Consisting of certain pretrial administrative papers and the exhibits in the trial court, suppose those exhibits which were and in one particular significant -- significant particular one which was not received into evidence of these materials as I learned on Saturday reported to this Court in late January of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.233" offset="690301">And I was much surprised by some of the information in them as I am by their sudden appearance at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.414" offset="727082">I agree and I'm knowledgeable as to the way of the Court and I don't know whether the Court should be considering it.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.734" offset="748398">I do know however that in view of their 11th hour, 59th minute appearance, I am inevitably caught somewhat by surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.763" offset="788522">I will try to the best of my ability to integrate the new material into my argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.859" offset="808897">Necessarily that's not been integrated into my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.004" offset="825407">I would simply ask the Court to keep that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.623" offset="843901">Excuse me, because of the shortness of time allotted for argument as well as presumably the Court's most particular interest, I will limit my oral argument to the confession issues involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.063" offset="897714">In this case, there are two, one, whether for lack of counsel's actual presence during the police in -- custody interrogation, petitioner's two confessions were properly admitted into evidence under Escobedo versus Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.440" offset="963229">Two, because this is a federal case, whether without regard for Escobedo, petitioner's confessions were improperly admitted as a matter of federal criminal law under the standards of McNabb versus United States and more specifically Anderson versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.691" offset="1052150">The factual circumstances surrounding the confessions maybe briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.481" offset="1071376">On the evening of March 20, 1963 at approximately 9:45, petitioner Carl Calvin Westover was arrested as he entered his parked car on a side street in Kansas City, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.401" offset="1127069">The arrest was made by two officers of the Kansas City police.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.558" offset="1143683">The chief purpose for the arrest was the suspicion that the petitioner was involved in two local Kansas City store holdups.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.772" offset="1196554">Both petitioner and his car were searched, a certain packet of money was recovered, and his car was impounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.838" offset="1224767">He was taken to the Kansas City police station, he was at that point placed in a lineup, identified as to one of the local charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.201" offset="1270220">Thereafter, the police booked him “for investigation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.923" offset="1293103">At that point, he had denied all criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.543" offset="1315568">The following morning however, the Kansas City police apparently according to hearsay testimony at his trial did obtained a confession on one of the local robbers shortly before noon.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.474" offset="1375336">At approximately 11:45 in the morning, the Kansas City police declared themselves through with the petitioner and the Kansas -- and the FBI Office in Kansas City was at that point permitted to interrogate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.168" offset="1450047">In something less than three hours, they returned from the interrogation room with two narrow conformed statements or confessions to the two federal robberies here concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.540" offset="1503545">The confession although in the handwriting of one of the interrogators was signed by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.362" offset="1538863">Each of the confessions were cited that Westover had been advised, that he need not make a statement, that any statement he made might be used against him, and that he had the right -- had the right to consult an “attorney”.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.998" offset="1597377">Each also recited that “no threats or promises” had been made to induce his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.829" offset="1624754">Each also recited that the statements were “voluntary”.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.771" offset="1644502">By the time these confessions were secured, Westover had been in custody for approximately 17 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.830" offset="1668744">He had not been taken for arraignment or loosely arraignment more properly preliminary hearing before either a Kansas City Magistrate or a U.S. Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.808" offset="1724646">The following day petitioner made certain changes in his statements, still in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.607" offset="1751813">The federal involvement of Westover's detention had included, besides the confessions themselves, the following, one, a specific telephone request prior to the booking “for investigative check” from the FBI that “the subject to be held for them also for questioning”.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.176" offset="1838122">At this point, it would seem appropriate for me to clear out the principle discrepancy between my prior understanding of the case and with what the Solicitor General's supplementary papers now do disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.160" offset="1898099">It was my understanding that the felony warrant from Sacramento, California to which the arresting officer referred and to which his arrest report preferred was a warrant on these two federal robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.236" offset="1962360">The Government however states and in one of their supplemental papers indeed seems to show that the felony warrant Sacramento, California was a state, not a federal warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.311" offset="2030696">My brief is of course in error, therefore in arguing that the clear federal interest was shown at the time of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.405" offset="2071030">However, those same papers which the Solicitor General has found, mdo clearly show that at least by the time of the booking, if not the arrest, the FBI was itself very interested in the petitioner for its own purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.748" offset="2144381">They showed that the booking was, in fact, at least as much for the FBI as for the local matters or the California felony warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.438" offset="2199134">As the arrest report which is prosecutions Exhibit 12 for identification shows, Westover was not booked on any specific charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.467" offset="2251274">As in Haynes versus Washington, it was a “small book” with a -- hold for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.143" offset="2297981">It then reads -- well, specifically it said investigation check-robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.407" offset="2323059">But then, what goes on to list -- the two matters which were to be checked, then recites as follows, prior to the booking -- prior to booking the subject, information was received from FBI agent, Leon Dub that Westover was wanted by the FBI for questioning and also that Sacramento, California holds a felony warrant for the subject which will be forwarded to this department.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.256" offset="2442491">And concluding, it recites Carl Calvin Westover was booked for investigation to be held for the number one and number two station detective units, this department and for the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.890" offset="2508946">Curiously it appears to me in reading the Solicitor General's brief that there is quite a conscious attempt to convey that only -- the only outside interest -- the only FBI interest at the time of the arrest or booking was the felony warrant in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.788" offset="2596613">This may not be conscious.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.965" offset="2601315">I think it's certainly reads that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.256" offset="2614481">The facts however show quite the contrary that there was an independent federal request for detention for its own questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.366" offset="2658889">The supplemental papers also showed that at least at the time of the booking, the federal authorities one, had a pretty fair ideas that petitioner was connected with the two Sacramento federal robberies enough to want to question him, and two, that they had by their request actively contributed if not to the arrest, to the booking and to Westover's subsequent detention for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.358" offset="2798801">The other matters of federal involvement are well-enough documented in my brief to warrant the passing reference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.834" offset="2824714">The joint federal state examination of the recovered currency, the joint federal state seizure of the top coat, the joint -- well, excuse me, the use of the state seized gun in procuring the federal confessions, and finally the transmittal of the state photographs or mugshots to Sacramento, California for use in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.992" offset="2925338">But the basis of these facts we submit that under both Escobedo and/or Anderson versus United States, the confession is very legally admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.672" offset="2972150">Notwithstanding these two different questions in this case, I cannot urge too strongly that both questions uncounseled interrogation have protracted detention or in my mind both, fundamentally vital to determination of the first issue, the Escobedo question.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.723" offset="3056264">Thus it would seem to me a big mistake for this Court to follow the lead afforded and offered by the Attorney -- by the Solicitor General and by the two governmental amicus briefs filed here which would seek to segregate these two items into two separate cellophane packages, one, police interrogation and as the second element quite apart, the period of lengthy detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.678" offset="3172143">As four of the five cases right now before this Court indicate protracted detention for interrogation appears a routine for this behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.885" offset="3216969">It is precisely because of this detention that it seems to me the need for a safeguard such as presence to coun -- presence of counsel has had to be evolved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.826" offset="3264721">As in Escobedo, it was to protect the incarcerated suspect from unwittingly or inadvisably relinquishing his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.974" offset="3321354">The evil thought to be corrected by an Escobedo type philosophy is not the street corner confession, not the sole bearing spontaneous confession of guilt, not the “picture straight from confusion at arm” as the Government suggest on page 23 of its brief, nor indeed does it have to be and this perhaps is not here that has to be decided, it does not seemed to be the brief question and answer period during what the Government calls the completion of administrative formalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.956" offset="3461266">What Escobedo does do, it seems to me, is to strike at precisely the very same evil which for federal law, the McNabb-Anderson exclusionary rule sought to strike out over 20 years ago, the secret detention for purposes of eliciting a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.080" offset="3553740">The second difficulty I find with the Solicitor General's approach is more serious, more crippling.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.135" offset="3577981">The Department of Justice would have this Court turn back the clock as though Escobedo and its precursors such as Spano, White and Massiah did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.303" offset="3622599">Thus the Government states as Mr. Earl has earlier alluded to, Escobedo was in fact nothing more than one more case of a coerced confession determined under a strictly traditional totality of the circumstances of given.In this light, the Government expresses some amazement that the present case was before your Court, says the Government repeatedly and at great length, there is “no showing” on this record that petitioners' confessions were the product of “coercion” or “overbearing” on the part of the interrogators viewed as a matter of the “totality of the circumstances”.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.585" offset="3795738">Of course we never argued that there was, but we did argue in our brief do argue now, is that the protracted detention combined with the police interrogation is itself inherently and unavoidably coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.616" offset="3859895">In that sense then, Mr. Justice Black, as opposed to the two petitioners who have already appeared before you we do, yes, claimed the confession was coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.619" offset="3911931">We believe that Escobedo went farther than coerced confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.502" offset="3935441">We believe also it was not simply a question of the wrong to be righted but a step in providing a remedy for that wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.758" offset="3984447">The fundamental philosophy of Escobedo seems to be the right against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.959" offset="4013286">The fundamental force of Escobedo seems to be the understanding, the realization that the right to counsel is necessary to remedy that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.424" offset="4071069">Under traditional views, we concede this particular case would presumably not have merited nor received, reviewed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.710" offset="4116208">We submit however that under Escobedo, the Court is trying to establish something less ephemeral, less open to case by case statutes, than the special circumstances type role of a Betts versus Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.436" offset="4187157">Finally on this point, I would suggest that the Solicitor General's entire approach to the problem in terms of police necessity versus individual rights is topsy-turvy backwards, has already discussed some of his alleged police needs “are entirely wide at the mark”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.438" offset="4283183">They themselves draw men or possibly read Harris, Escobedo would it not -- would not in any case interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.580" offset="4315784">Others are particularly irrelevant to the terms of this particular and not a typical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.825" offset="4340757">Thus his reference to one, the unwitnessed crime or the police officer forced to act "in the exigencies of the moment without opportunity for detached reflection".</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.568" offset="4399689">Quite obviously, these are most thoroughly inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.422" offset="4415154">I submit there are (Inaudible) injured -- conjured up in order to frighten this Court back from what it has already held, has already held, and it is not completely interested in coerced confessions under traditional views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.805" offset="4476594">In any event, however the approach is backwards, the Court has affirmed, in loud tones, that in weighing police aide and individual right, the balance has been struck in favor of the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.414" offset="4535108">Thus, if the Solicitor General's approach of a case by case evaluation of the totality of the circumstances is correct and should be adopted with exceptions thereafter to be carved out, we submit the rule, the starting place, it should be the individual's constitutional rights versus self-incrimination as protected by the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.836" offset="4632806">With the police interference with those rights, the exceptions, being the matters which should be allowed in exceptional cases where on a totality of the circumstances a need in fact is shown to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.119" offset="4701874">Certainly there was no such need here that the prosecuting attorney himself stated the confessions were simply the ‘frosting on the cake'.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.401" offset="4743043">As the Solicitor General's brief admits the other evidence was overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.416" offset="4771046">There simply was no police need at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.006" offset="4789436">And I submit that Mr. Seagull's credential is notwithstanding, we would find that in many cases where confessions were used, there would be no need at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.503" offset="5111474">On the Anderson point, I would just like to make a very brief comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.432" offset="5143134">Even conceding that as I now discover the federal authorities had no part in the original arrest, they clearly had a large and a thoroughly well-documented part in the subsequent detention for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.844" offset="5208754">We submit the many pertinent facts and factors surrounding petitioner's arrest, detention, overwhelmingly bring the case within Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.305" offset="5258595">They also put the case squarely outside United States versus Coppola, 365 U.S. 762.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.378" offset="5290883">There it was found the federal authorities had “in no way caused or contributed to Coppola's detention”, Exhibit 12 for identification precludes such a finding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.790" offset="5352532">It was also found in Coppola that the interrogation by the FBI “did not contribute to any delay in arraignment” since he was initially interrogated by the federal authorities in the midnight hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.451" offset="5423271">Here, when the interrogation began at 11:45 in the morning, certainly no such finding can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.550" offset="5463604">I submit that if the Court's sanctions were occurred in this case simply because the detention was nominally that of the state although not for any specific state charge, it will effectively have taken all (Inaudible) from the McNabb exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.588" offset="5539777">It will encourage states to adopt broader and broader small book statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.527" offset="5559526">It will openly invite federal authorities to find themselves sanctuary forbidden to them directly in requesting to state authorities that the subject be held for them also for questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.760" offset="5624414">In our case, as a matter of federal law if not as a matter of constitutional law, the confession should have been excluded, the Commission should be overturned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.067" offset="5741652">I think in the first place, we have to get a few things cleared up on the factual basis of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.494" offset="5775402">There is not one word in this record at any place that there was any cooperation at all between the state and the FBI other than one that they did notify and they wanted to talk to Westover and on 11:45 the following morning, they told him they like to talk to him and they didn't until 12:00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.170" offset="5882086">These 17 hours is also very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.941" offset="5901208">He was arrested at 9:45, tried to the Kansas City Police Headquarters after questioning on the street and searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.751" offset="5944466">And that sometime thereafter, he was put in a lineup and identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.541" offset="5971634">And at 11:45, he was booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.896" offset="5988979">And petitioner himself said booked him to the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.484" offset="6007369">We are unable to find in the record whether he was booked at the police headquarters or the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.870" offset="6024923">It's kind of confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.359" offset="6034850">But I have checked and while it does not appear in the record, the jail is directly across the street from the police headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.268" offset="6066510">But this interrogation for 17 hours is not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.152" offset="6090021">The record shows he was questioned for a portion of the time between 9:45 and 11:45 at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.335" offset="6130772">He was questioned sometime the next morning but the only pinpoint on that is that 11:45, he was seen talking to a police sergeant into open area of the police headquarters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.020" offset="6245501">The other thing is that what is in the record is that at no time was any federal officer present while the State was questioning, that's positive testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.075" offset="6301717">It's also a positive testimony that there were no state officer present when they questioned him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.411" offset="6471095">At 12, they gave them a private room and the federal questioning started at 12 noon on the day after his night arrest at 9:45.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.618" offset="6519892">The -- there is also evidence and this evidence is from the defense counsel in calling FBI agents as his witnesses despite the judge, it seemed -- it looks as though he got somebody with uniform with the other team on but he still called them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.364" offset="6590840">And they testified positively that this man was in perfect condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.958" offset="6625217">He seemed to have complete control of his faculties, and number one, there's nothing in this record that he ever asked to call anybody at anytime under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.200" offset="6690210">The record also shows that he was obviously from California with California licensed plates, living in a hotel in Kansas City and so far the record shows, he didn't have any friends, relatives, or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.323" offset="6754680">He did not take to stand himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.672" offset="6876097">In sentencing, the Court says, “You know and realize that had you been tried under the laws of the State of California for the same robbery you could've gotten life", and he said, “Yes sir.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.744" offset="7080375">I'm sorry if you didn't get them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.299" offset="7094585">I -- what I concluded before lunch, I'm at the point where I wanted to make it clear that while there's nothing in the record to show what happened the night before, there's also nothing in the record to show that Westover was at anytime won by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.474" offset="7167310">There's nothing in the record one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.308" offset="7178700">The statutes and the rules of Missouri do apply that a man must be brought to the stage of arraignment within 20 hours after arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.824" offset="7224675">That brings me to the point that I think is a crux of this case, is that the Mallory Rule and the Anderson case, and a couple of cases so relied upon by petitioner just do not bear any factual basis in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.143" offset="7314014">I don't believe there is this stage of anything wrong with the state and the Federal Government in the prosecutorial stage having a statement where one as the other, “If you find counsel, I want to talk to him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.221" offset="7386321">There's no question that when he was picked up the night before, it was, as the petitioner admits primarily for the two robberies in Kansas City specifically a finance company and a bakery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.105" offset="7457792">Much is made of the fact that the money that was seized on Westover, $607 was seized by the state police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.305" offset="7498648">It was examined jointly by the state police and the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.540" offset="7527591">It is true that the state and the FBI jointly took down the serial numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.116" offset="7561864">One read it off and the other marked it down for the use of both to see which place the money -- the sale money would fit into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.866" offset="7596868">And the record shows that least as to the federal charges in the banks that were robbed, they had these packs of money with marked bills in which they stick into the tellers' cages for this expressed purpose in case they are robbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.680" offset="7660189">But this -- there's nothing illegal about the cooperation in that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.487" offset="7687356">Secondly, as I mentioned, there were no federal officers present during state interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.937" offset="7713165">That is in the record, positively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.981" offset="7729361">Secondly, that the state police denied that they made any inducement to Westover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.992" offset="7765410">That if you talk to the federal or anything, they never mentioned it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.037" offset="7785576">Then it's repeatedly said by each of the witnesses that there was no deal of any kind between the police and the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.815" offset="7828731">And this evidence is brought out by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.999" offset="7845449">It's clear that at the time the FBI examined Westover, he was a state prisoner and not a federal prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.575" offset="7891738">On page 79 of the record, there is a testimony that Westover, when the FBI began to question him, he was mentally alert and appeared to know exactly what he was doing, no evidence that he had been held up late at night or kept awake or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.360" offset="7962896">There was no federal warrant outstanding at the time of his arrest -- I mean at the time that he's questioned by the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.807" offset="8000616">And the FBI agent says positively at the time they questioned him, they had none of the details concerning the Sacramento robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.378" offset="8046905">Not only was he advised of his rights by witness of the evidence of the two statements he made but the FBI agents testified from the witness stand that he was fully advised of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.204" offset="8110226">And that statement is that I advised him that he didn't have to make a statement, that any statement he made could be used against him in a court of law and that he had the right to see an attorney before he made the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.855" offset="8184832">And the final point is everything I have said is uncontradicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3955.246" offset="15926376">The -- I left San Francisco on Friday, therefore the page proofs mailed to me Wednesday, did not arrive in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.399" offset="15958977">It certainly is not Solicitor General's fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.236" offset="15970367">The printed brief mailed Thursday did not arrive at that time either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.986" offset="15985413">However, I do think it is a little odd that an ex parte request was made for this additional material on January 14th of this year without notifying me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.444" offset="16027209">I think it is also odd, curious that I ask to the exhibits when I was first assigned this case from December of 1963 and could not get them and now suddenly they're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.173" offset="16070154">I would also now on the merits make a few comments on what the Solicitor General has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.782" offset="16100561">First thing that the record has absolutely nothing in it, then he turns around and he can coax this wild story that the petitioner decided to trade a federal conviction or state conviction for a federal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.222" offset="16174331">He coursed to the fact the trial judge in California so commented sometime thereafter, a number of interesting points, first, of course, the state charges would have been Missouri, not California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.828" offset="16228770">Secondly, he is presently serving a sentence of 30 years with under federal law minimum parole of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.368" offset="16270879">Under the maximum of the statutes, he was convicted on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.858" offset="16284881">It would have been a 15-year sentence with earliest parole permissible in slightly less than 34 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.810" offset="16320616">As this Court I think knows, California at least customarily pardons life sentences at about seven to nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.490" offset="16359382">The sentence under California law would have been five years to life, not just life as the Solicitor General's brief points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.398" offset="16386968">If indeed, Westover made this choice to trade one for the other at the time he was in custody, I submit that shows pretty adequately he certainly needed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.503" offset="16435451">He made a lousy choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.438" offset="16451124">Secondly, on the couple of point on the detention, we of course, are not arguing here nor did we below but the Court of Appeals adopted the same view that there's nothing illegal about state federal cooperation, of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.406" offset="16519043">There is however something illegal and I would submit perhaps unconstitutional about an arraigned, unadvised detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.361" offset="16562824">It then becomes a question of looking to see how the federal authorities contributed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.019" offset="16597514">Whether or not Missouri has a small book, 20-hour statute permitting state authorities to hold without a specific charge, I don't think we want to encourage that in federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.261" offset="16654461">This Court need not reach constitutional proportions to strike it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.247" offset="16678390">I'd like to quote just because I think it sound from what the Second Circuit said in the Coppola decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.322" offset="16710677">It said if this cooperation between federal state authorities reached the point of arresting detention by local police for the purpose of enabling federal officers now not the only purpose perhaps with the purpose to question the defendants concerning the bank robberies for a period of time forbidden on federal officers by Rule 5 (a) of the federal rules of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.236" offset="16814331">Admissions thus obtained would properly be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.220" offset="16834288">Such a rule prevents federal officers from evading the letter and the spirit of Rule 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.501" offset="16871382">I'd add just a few words to Mr. Justice Fortas' colloquy with the Solicitor General on the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.096" offset="16909834">I find it very odd that the standard warning that the federal be -- Federal Bureau of Investigation gives to counsel -- gives to accused is that they have a right to counsel yet the Solicitor General stands up here and says, “Oh, but they don't have the right."</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.249" offset="16978380">I can't understand whether the Federal Government is talking out of both sides of its mouth at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.939" offset="17005129">Are they simply empty words which in fact mean nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.011" offset="17041492">Finally, I would like to comment on the discussion that has concerned whether or not a person without means to provide a lawyer can say or will say I won't talk or I want a lawyer before I talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.789" offset="17124561">I submit first it's pretty hard for a person in detention to stand up to the police, certainly hard for anybody except some experienced criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.475" offset="17163327">That aside however, if that is to be meaningful, the common federal practice which this case has won't assure it, that is to say unless you have something like a tape recording of what went on, a verbatim statement of the questions and answers, it is a hollow thing to say and ever thereafter to know of whether or not the right to counsel and the right to remain silent was ever intelligently waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.997" offset="17305433">Certainly a narrative statement such as this where the federal officer in just what was said and puts it down in the words, "Oh, by the way, I wanted to -- I would also like to say that", that certainly simply shows no signs of a waiver or much of anything else.</text>

            <text syncTime="4347.753" offset="17496440">First, I point out the prompt arraignment statutes on the books of well over half of the states, of the union, and point out that as this Court knows, they are commonly ignored.</text>

            <text syncTime="4369.657" offset="17584003">I would comment secondly that I think the approach of the American Civil Liberties Union is very sad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.273" offset="17606468">They say -- you needn't say a right to counsel is ipso facto and (Inaudible), the only way we can protect the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.509" offset="17659444">What they do say is what -- with what we have now, that's the only way we can protect that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.359" offset="17690896">That leaves you open later if this state comes up with something else, something better.</text>

            <text syncTime="4436.980" offset="17853377">The American Civil Liberties Union for example puts the right very heavily on the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.814" offset="17888695">But as I said in my argument in chief, I think what Escobedo did was to device a means to protect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.106" offset="17925893">I think as it's already been said, they are both and they're part and parcel but I think Escobedo went more than Malloy versus Hogan.</text>
