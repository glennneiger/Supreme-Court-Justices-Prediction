            <text syncTime="37.316" offset="252635">This case involves the question of racial segregation in a large public park in the City of Macon, Georgia which is open to the entire public except the Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.380" offset="312926">This Court granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia which affirmed the judgment of the superior court of Bibb County.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.263" offset="360469">The case arrived that its present posture after a lengthy series of pleadings involving five sets of parties, the Board of Managers of the park, Baconsfield, certain heirs named Sparks and certain heirs named Curry, the City of Macon and the Negro interveners, and some of these parties shifted their position that during the course of the litigation in ways that significantly affected the substantive rights involved and they asked the Court's indulgence while I relate the substance of this series of papers which may be tedious so that the case can properly be understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.763" offset="526399">The case was commenced by an entity known as the Board of Managers of the park which was named Baconsfield that was created in a will written in 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.162" offset="576031">The Board originally had been appointed by the City of Macon and all successor members of the Board since it came into being or appointed by the mayor and council of the City of Macon.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.081" offset="735692">Now the Board which had been appointed by the city Mr. Justice Brennan then brought suit against the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.044" offset="763591">It turned on its part in a sense charging that the city had not been faithful to a racially restrictive provision in the will of the late Senator who's name was Augustus Octavius Bacon and because the will had originally created the park for white persons only.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.784" offset="834539">The city feeling that it was inhibited by law from enforcing this racial restriction had not enforced it for several weeks preceding the institution of the suit in 1963.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.471" offset="897233">In 1963, Negroes had started going upon the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.754" offset="914369">The Board of Managers had asked the city to enforce this provision of the will.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.426" offset="933073">The Board of Managers brought suit against the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.555" offset="945612">The board asserted in its complaint that if the city would discharge its trustee and if three private trustees were then substituted, the Board could bring suit against the city in mandamus or otherwise to compel it presumably in its police capacity to do something which was inhibited from doing in it's trustee capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.535" offset="1037563">And it said in its complaint that -- they said that the city would discharge this trustee and a private trustee were appointed instead, the private trustees could then mandamus the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.240" offset="1080299">It will bring some other kind of preceding against the city or other law enforcement officers to carryout these duties so that the racially restricted provisions of the will would be observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.532" offset="1117497">Now the city didn't resist the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.113" offset="1143829">It said two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.813" offset="1146650">One, it could not convey the property to carryout this intent of the testator, and two, it could not enforce racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.297" offset="1180609">And it threw its hands up and asked the Court for instructions about what to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.939" offset="1299101">The Board then moved a summary judgment, now before the superior court could rule on the motion for summary judgment, Negro citizens of Macon intervened in this theretofore relatively non-controversial lawsuit and asserted that Baconsfield was a public park that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited the Court from entering an order of appointing successor trustees who could operate and maintain Baconsfield on a segregated basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.959" offset="1411218">The Board of Managers responded to this by asking for an injunction excluding Negroes from the park and to allow certain other areas known as the Sparks to intervene in the case and permit the [Inaudible] who previously had been sued to realign themselves on the side of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.958" offset="1471195">Previously they've been the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.363" offset="1480808">And both sets of heirs then filed additional pleadings joining in the prayer of the Board of Mangers and also asking for an injunction to keep all Negroes out of the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.594" offset="1517798">And the heirs' pleadings at this point stated that in the event that the will of the testator with regard to the segregation condition could not be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.981" offset="1559280">They asked that the property then referred to them, approximately 100 acres in the center of the City of Macon.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.294" offset="1596583">Well, while all this was pending and the Court did not yet resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.463" offset="1613197">Matters came to ahead when the City of Macon adopted a resolution that amounted to consenting to a judgment against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.274" offset="1644440">It adopted a resolution purporting to resign as trustee, the resolution admitted that the testators' intent with regard to segregation is not going to pay, it asserted that the city deemed that in the public interest that this be operated as a public park although into the white public rather than revert to the heirs as private property, said that it could not in good conscience operate a non-segregated park in will of the testator and authorized the mayor and the council to sign a written resignation and to divert to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.890" offset="1790934">And this is what they did with an amended pleading in which the mayor and council prayed that the Court accept the resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.452" offset="1829177">They asked for permission to resign and the resignation was not self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.440" offset="1845164">They asked for permission to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.665" offset="1854046">They asked that private trustees be appointed and then they said if private trustees were appointed, they would have no further duties and that they would no longer be a necessary party for litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.995" offset="1907336">At this point, the Negro interveners filed a further paper amending their petition and alleged that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited the relief requested by the plaintiffs and the city and prayed that the Court withhold approval of the resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.734" offset="1978284">The Court however, accepted the resignation and the Court appointed new trustees and the court retained jurisdiction for the purpose of appointing additional trustees should vacancies occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.530" offset="2029484">And along with its judgment, they wrote a letter of opinion that appears on page 6 of our brief stating why this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.073" offset="2063653">It's in the footnote, the letter opinion stated the inability of the City of Macon as trustee to apply constitutionally the racial criterion prescribed by the testator for use of the property as a park for white women and white children affected the trustee and not the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.034" offset="2143483">And the city had intended its resignation as trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.482" offset="2157275">It is proper that the Court accept the resignation and appoint private trustees who can carryout the purpose and intent of the testator as set forth in the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.837" offset="2206699">On appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia, the State Supreme Court affirmed primarily viewing the case as one in which the superior court was faced with a vacancy in the trusteeship and stating that courts of equity always can appoint trustees whenever there is a vacancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.351" offset="2280782">Now, Senator Bacon's will which is the subject of this case was written in 1911, six years after the passage of a Georgia statute that plays an important part in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.810" offset="2342640">Section 69-504 of the Georgia Code which appears on page 3 of our brief provides that any person may give to any municipal corporation in the state in fee simple or entrust or the private persons as trustees, lands dedicated in perpetuity to the public as a park.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.000" offset="2435323">And then the conveyance provide that the use of the park shall be limited to the white race only or to white women and children only or to the colored race only or to colored women and children only or to any other race, or the women and children of any other race only.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.466" offset="2497285">And then the subsequent section, Section 505 of the code, the municipalities were empowered to accept such gifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.778" offset="2534484">Senator Bacon's will in items 9 and 10, established the Park of Baconsfield after the death of his wife and two daughters and virtually the language of the statute, following the statute very closely, he established the park for the use of white women and children of the City of Macon only, although he authorized his trustees in their discretion to permit white men or white residents of other cities to enter the park, something which later was authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.835" offset="2658722">Now, petitioners submit that the judgment below and its the judgment we're focusing on which accepted resignations and appointed new trustees was erroneous and therefore should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.416" offset="2713057">This judgment if undone would lead the parties where they were before the commencement of this litigation with the result that is obedient to the Constitution and laws of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="774.557" offset="3201651">While it was necessary, the interveners or petitioners here could argue that any one of these factors indicates the Fourteenth Amendment has been violated. Certainly cumulatively we submit as I Burton against The Wilmington Parking Authority, we have here such an aggregation of facts here as to constitute that critical mess, that -- that accumulation which adds up to a violation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.621" offset="3305827">And of course, these factors is the Section 69-504 of the Georgia Code, now what was the relationship between 69-504 and Senator Bacon's will the provision that set up the park and set it up as racially restricted park.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.991" offset="3371342">Respondents say on page 52 of their brief that Senator Bacon probably did not even know that Section 69-504 existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.654" offset="3406033">Now, we say that this contention has to be rejected just as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.819" offset="3422647">The law is on the books, but beyond that, we have to take into account, something which is got in the record, but historical facts, Senator Bacon was a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.310" offset="3456606">He was a member of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.523" offset="3465488">He had a will here which is a highly complicated will but obviously if he didn't draw it himself, he would draw with legal advice, and that he's just totally incredible that he or his counsel did not know that there was this section on the books which his will practically parallels in its language, the coincidence is too incredibly for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.580" offset="3549706">Now, if one were contemplating setting up a will for white women park, white women and children only, I can tell that the George Law of 1911, he would have found that part in Section 69-504, the George Law of Charitable Trusts which appears on page 24 and 25 of our brief, lists a series of purposes for which a charitable trust may be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.024" offset="3647509">And there is nothing which by any stretch of the imagination can be held to constitute authority to set up a park by charitable trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.381" offset="3680946">At the very least a conscious lawyer setting up a charitable trust involving an awful lot of money, would have great hesitation to setting one up on the mere authority of the charitable trust statute as it appears in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.122" offset="3735907">If he would then look at the other authority for setting up a park for white women and children only, he would look at the general law of dedication which is the method by which parks usually are established and he would find that if you dedicate something to the public and there would be some Georgia authority, for this is well a general authority, it must be to the whole public and it's impossible to dedicate something only to a portion of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.566" offset="3829635">So he would have been in considerable doubt as to whether he could set up a park by charitable trust for white women and children only.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.372" offset="3864848">He would either be faced with the alternative of setting up a park for everybody or setting up no park at all, but when he turned to Section 69-504, he would have seen the solution to his problem, an explicit authority to accomplish what he desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.310" offset="3928586">And so we state that as in Anderson against Martin and Peterson against Greenville -- City of Greenville, here is a state law which intrudes itself into the process and incorporates a racial component that the courts cannot ignore it.</text>
