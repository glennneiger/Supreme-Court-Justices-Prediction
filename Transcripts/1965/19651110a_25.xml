            <text syncTime="54.244" offset="320345">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.429" offset="333093">This case in here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to reveal its judgment, reversing on the conviction respondent for conspiracy to defraud the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.880" offset="394846">The charges against respondent which the jury and for that matter the Court of Appeals found established by the evidence, were that he used, that he took money to use his position as a Congressman in the interest to co-defendants represented so called independent Maryland Savings and Loan Association, first to make a speech on the floor of Congress and then to use his Congressional influence to bear on the Department of Justice to get it, to dismiss an indictment against his co-defendant and one of its companies, first calling.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.797" offset="582510">The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction solely because it reached the conclusion that it was beyond the power of Congress to provide where the prosecution of a Congressman for taking money to make its speech on the floor of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.123" offset="667878">It reversed the conviction on substantive counts, which did not involve the speech at all but only the representations to the Department of Justice, only because it felt that the evidence we laid into the speech part of the conspiracy might have influenced the verdict of the jury on the other counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.929" offset="759097">And so the question that we brought to the Court and the only question that we think it's properly involved in this case now revolves around the taking of money to give a speech on the floor of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.053" offset="863587">We referred in our petition but we did not argue it, I might say largely because it cannot be determined without reaching -- reading the whole record.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.705" offset="914160">The question in this case which we did bring here and which we think it's a question involved is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.417" offset="941014">Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution provides that for any speech or debate in either House, no member of Congress shall be questioned in any other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.667" offset="1014053">And as we view it, the question is, does that Speech or Debate Clause means that Congress is without power under the Constitution to make it a crime triable in a court for a Congressman to take money to make a speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.051" offset="1111542">And the opinion of Court of Appeals --</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="253.960" offset="1119169">May I ask under what statute Congress has made it a crime?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="beatrice_rosenberg" startTime="258.209" stopTime="478.280">
            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="258.209" offset="1136201">What Congress had, specifically made it a crime at what was formally 18 U.S.C. 205.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.581" offset="1161697">I think my opponent will dispute this, because he says if a speech wasn't have to a matter then pending it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.641" offset="1189909">This indictment was brought under as a conspiracy to defraud the United States of the good offices of a Congressman in two parts; one to make the speech and the other to bring his influence to bear on the Department of Justice and so what was charged is the conspiracy under 371, but the way the Court of Appeals decided the question, it is no doubt I think if you will look at its opinion which is in volume 3 that it was deciding it very broadly, said it was beyond the power of Congress to make it a crime to take money for anything that came within the Speech and Debate Clause, which under this Court Kilbourn decision means more than speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.341" offset="1404740">It means speech or vote or committee report or anything in a sense which is official action and so that's the way that Court of Appeals decided the case that the Speech or Debate Clause by its terms made it constitutionally impossible for Congress to make the taking of money or bribery a crime for anything done within the protection of that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.471" offset="1529292">And this would cover 205 as well as the aspect of 371 with which we are here concerned and now I think it is helpful both for the general problem on which case was decided and for this particular case, if we consider first that general preposition which the Court of Appeals decided and then turn to that particular fact that this case to see whether there's special problems arising out of the fact that it was charged under 371 or in the particular prosecution here.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.800" offset="1682578">The government's basic position is that a prosecution for taking money to make a speech does not question that speech within the meaning of the Speech or Debate Clause because what is being questioned is not the speech, but the taking of the money and the taking of the money of course is not official action and does not occur on the floor commonly.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.858" offset="1802846">I don't think analytically there can be any problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.273" offset="1816430">It's obvious that the taking of money is not something that's official action on the floor of Congress and I think that it becomes clear if one hypothesizes a situation where a Congressman, where the evidence is discovered immediately, let's say by a tape recorder and a Congressman is arrested immediately before he had given the speech for which he took money.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.986" offset="1939310">In that case he would come within a bribery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.009" offset="1955401">He would be prosecuted for taking money to make a speech, but the speech would never had been given then the Speech and Debate Clause would never come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.036" offset="1991555">Now of course we realize that the question isn't normally that simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.934" offset="2107120">Well, it would introduce to show it was one apart of the evidence, showing that money was taken for the speech, but let me point out that the reprint that was introduced was in at least one significant respect different from the speech that was given, because the caption was changed on the reprint.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.138" offset="2187891">The caption on the original speech which the government did not introduce, dependent introduced the original speech, caption on the original speech was something like the Maryland Savings and Loan industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.047" offset="2239509">The caption on the reprint that was introduced was Federal Savings and Loan leaves seek discretion of competitive independence and commercial mortgage insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.334" offset="2320697">Now of course the government gave evidence about the speech, it gave reasons about how it was prepared and what use was made of it by the co-conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.406" offset="2361031">Of course it was the government's theory that money was given to make a speech, but it was not, the content of the speech was not part of the governments plan.</text>

            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="587.278" offset="2452459">Yes, after the defendant took the stand, he was cross examined about some statements in the speech and they were commented upon in oral argument, but if the government in its affirmative case did not rely on the content of the speech or the government relied on was on other evidence, but as I say leaning that out as the moment the specific problems here, the question was Court of Appeals deciding is not that.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.960" offset="2575235">It did not decide simply that it was too much reference to the speech in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.829" offset="2594670">It's said much more broadly that it is beyond the competence of Congress to provide for to make it a crime, to take money to make a speech and the reasoning of the Court of Appeals as I understand it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.849" offset="2678784">No matter how strong the evidence, even if the government never even introduces the speech, assuming the speech has once been given, as it would be in the normal case, no matter how strong the evidence the government introduces, any Congressman who can't deny that he took money.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.095" offset="2767705">Its of course would be the best, but assuming he can't deny that he took money, he will be called upon to explain, he will feel compelled to explain that he gave the money – that he gave a speech not for money but for some other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.718" offset="2842206">And therefore taking the language out of cases like this Court's decision in Tenney against Brandhove, which says that the motives of official action cannot be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.388" offset="2908975">The Court of Appeals said you bring motive into the case, because the Congressman will feel compelled to explain his motives and that's not the speech in debate clause, but as we see it, there is a big difference between this situation and Tenney and others like it [Inaudible] is that when you bring an action in libel which what Tenney was or where the Speech and Debate Clause got started, where the king brought an action for sedition or treason or criminal libel so that either civilly or criminally whenever this is done, the affirmative part of the plaintiffs case is that you prove the speech, the content of the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.849" offset="3150764">You prove that the contents were injurious, that it results in the injury, either to the individual bringing the action or to the state because the contents were treasonable or seditious in the old days and that this injury was caused by a bad motive and the Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.729" offset="3258284">That's too dangerous to free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.622" offset="3273853">They said and the reason of it I think it's barely evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.855" offset="3290781">The most noble test at most accurate speech that it can be made can result an injury to someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.242" offset="3336338">I mean, it's justifiable injury, but it is injury, therefore when you have to start and say this injury is a good motive or bad motive, that becomes court say too difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.674" offset="3406033">Because too many actions -- they didn't come a prosecutor brings for example, brings its lawsuit against this defendant to be injured, the defendant will be get in to jail, it's too hard to distinguish if he's doing it for a good motive or a bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.547" offset="3465592">Its hard to say, is the speech reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="845.221" offset="3484296">Situation is very different from bribery, because you're not resting on the content of speech to show injury which comes from a bad motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.518" offset="3525465">What you're resting on is what I said in the beginning, you're resting on the taking of the money and it doesn't matter what the speech is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.771" offset="3558484">The speech could be the best speech in the world, it could absolutely accurate in every degree, but the injury doesn't come from the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.402" offset="3596936">The injury to the government comes from the taking of the money, that's the injury and you don't relay on the contents of the speech even to show injury or you don't rely on the content of a speech as the foundation of your action.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.012" offset="3799437">The injury comes from the taking of the money and it points in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.608" offset="3849801">Suppose they have a scheme where one Congressman who's supposed to make a speech for them and a speech against them, each took money because they wanted to make it appear, it wouldn't make any difference, where the one was for them or one was against them, both would be guilty of taking bribes.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.672" offset="3978010">We have a principle about judicial decisions, so for as an action for libel or action for treason are concerned the content of the judicial privilege is set.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.923" offset="4031091">This Court held back in 231 United States that the principle that a judge couldn't be sued for libel was so much of a part of our system of doing things that it extended to Philippines immediately without any -- as by virtue of the Constitution without any special act of Congress and yet we've always had a statute from 1790 on, we've had a statute making bribery of the judge of crime, there had been prosecution to judges for taking bribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.515" offset="4325439">It came in because judges in the sense were acting the way of not responsible to anybody about themselves and therefore they didn't -- they weren't the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.006" offset="4383431">The difficulty -- one of the problems of the Speech and Debate Clause I think is that side by side in the beginning with the development of the Speech and Debate Clause was the attempt by parliament to get himself completely out of the crown what was known as the Lex Parliament.</text>
