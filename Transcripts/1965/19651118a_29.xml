            <text syncTime="11.101" offset="147728">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.714" offset="158177">This is a direct appeal by the United States from two judgments of the District Court for the Southern district to Indiana entered in two criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.588" offset="209690">The cases are consolidated in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.736" offset="226304">To begin with the relevant prior proceedings, in December of 1962, each of the appellees pleaded guilty to a narcotics violation, an offense under Section 4705 of the Revenue Code, the written order formed provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.381" offset="324942">Each received at that time the minimum sentence permitted by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.395" offset="348975">That was 10 years in the case of Ewell and he was a second offender and five years in Dennis’ case.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.402" offset="388995">Some seven months after this conviction in an unrelated case, Lauer against the United States, the Seventh Circuit ruled that an indictment under Section 4705 was defective if it failed to name the purchaser of the narcotics and it held moreover that this defect was cognizable on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.960" offset="503202">Relying upon that decision, Ewell several months after initiated proceedings of his own under Section 2255 and Dennis followed suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.410" offset="569031">These motions were promptly heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.739" offset="582301">They were granted by the District Court for force on the authority of the Lauer decision and the government at the first grand jury session thereafter procured new indictments against both of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.735" offset="666311">Appellees thereupon moved to dismiss these new indictments and on two grounds; one a claim of prior jeopardy and two, a claim that to retry them would deny them a right of speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.710" offset="750216">The District Court rejected the claim of prior jeopardy, but it dismissed the indictments on the Sixth Amendment ground and since the orders were based upon a plea in bar the appeal comes directly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.043" offset="839555">At no point in the processing of these cases was there any protracted delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.664" offset="870066">For convenience, I've asked the clerk to distribute a chart which gives the Court the essential chronology and though I will not take the time to go over the dates here, I think Your Honors will observe that these cases did move with dispatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.202" offset="944149">The District Court's opinion, in fact, affirmatively states and I use its language that this is not a case for charges of neglect against the government or the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.702" offset="1006216">The District Court recognized also that the original indictment was sufficient under the law as it stood at the time the indictment was drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.388" offset="1056893">Also, I might say parenthetically that it would be sufficient today.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.533" offset="1081553">Lauer has been uniformly rejected in all of the other circuits in which the point has been raised and only recently, the Seventh Circuit itself overruled the Lauer position, but what if we assume that there was error as distinguished from oppressive fault of any kind in the government's drafting of the first indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.022" offset="1203493">Presumably there is error of some kind in every case in which a judgment of conviction is set aside whether on direct appeal or on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.516" offset="1253439">Yet it has never been the law in this country that the correction of error on the defendant's appeal bars a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.142" offset="1311953">By speaking the correction, the defendant is deemed to have waived any claim of prior jeopardy and only recently in the Tateo case, the Court will recall the opinion of the Court observed that this rule serves the interest of defendants generally as well as of the public for otherwise it seems doubtful that appellate courts would be so ready to find error at least in cases where the evidence of guilt was compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.790" offset="1450506">Cases like Tateo and many others which we might cite stand equally for the proposition that a retrial does not violate the provisions of the Sixth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="417.557" offset="1773589">– because the reindictment set out three offenses here.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.031" offset="1791457">The District Court's decision, Your Honor will recall was they'd simply upon the proposition that a retrial could not occur here because of the passage of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.358" offset="1840776">The Court said that the necessity for setting aside the conviction was the result of an inconsistency in the developing law and that the defendant should not be tax with the consequence of that inconsistency in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.078" offset="1919666">And that reasoning would apply, had we brought the new indictment under precisely the same charge as well as to the situation as it comes to the Court where the US attorney brought the same charge and additional charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.048" offset="2007542">Now there is a strong suggestion in the opinion and I think that explains the result perhaps that the District Court was motivated by a concern as to the sentence which it would have to adjudge in the event of a re-conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.044" offset="2087581">It pointed out that the narcotics statutes contain a provision for a minimum sentence and the minimum penalties had in fact been imposed at the first conviction of these appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.977" offset="2155290">The Court also noted that the narcotic statutes prohibit the suspension of sentence or the suspension of the imposition of sentence and that they do not allow for probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.953" offset="2219133">And the judge concluded from this that if the appellees were convicted anew, they could not be credited with the time that they had already served some 19 months under the invalidated conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.238" offset="2292276">We doubt that the District Court was correct in this analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.400" offset="2312965">The narcotic statutes do indeed prescribe a minimum sentence which cannot be suspended, but it does not seem to me to follow necessarily from this; that the Court could not credit time already served under an invalidated conviction resting upon the identical transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.891" offset="2406902">I suggest that it could impose the minimum term less the time already served.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.059" offset="2539604">Well I can tell, Your Honor something about the practice which the District Court in Indiana where this case comes from has followed in an identical group of cases which followed the Lauer decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.619" offset="2597804">In all of those cases, the government did what it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.259" offset="2616404">In addition to indicting under the Section 4705 offense which I mentioned earlier, it charged other offenses based on the same transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.863" offset="2666872">Your Honor, will find the three statutes on this little chart we've submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.693" offset="2690173">In all of those cases which have been disposed off to date, the Court passed sentence under Section 4704 which carries a lesser penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.914" offset="2747016">The government agreed to a dismissal of the offenses involving the heavier charge and the District Court then imposed a sentence less than the original sentence imposed and one which in effect therefore gave credit for the time already served.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.590" offset="3125687">No, and I know of no opinion which discusses the question of the power of the Court to do what I've suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.758" offset="3150451">It does seem to me that it is consistent with the language of the statute and if it be true as appellees contest, that there would be a constitutional doubt if a sentence which did not give credit were imposed upon a retrial that would reinforce I think the thought that the statute might be construed to permit that limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.726" offset="3262255">Now there are cases, I'm not talking about the cases involving the Lauer problem or narcotic cases in particular where the Courts had re -- had imposed a heavier sentence on a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.541" offset="3313560">Cases of this Court have had set aside convictions later resulted in heavier penalty and that's not rare event, but insofar as there should be any constitutional problem which might arise in circumstances where it might be thought that a Court was discouraging resort to legal process by imposing a heavier sentence in the event of a re-conviction to the extent of that might present a problem, I say it isn't presented here and for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.398" offset="3473011">In the first place, even in the event of a re-conviction under all of the charges which were brought on the second indictment, the judge could impose concurrent sentences and I think could give credit for time already served.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.888" offset="3542915">Beyond that, we have attempted to remove that problem from this case altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.759" offset="3570395">The United States Attorney advised the district judge when the government petitioned for rehearing of his order dismissing the indictment; that if the defendants here were found guilty under the 4704 charge which carries the lesser penalty, that the government proposed to dismiss the other charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.935" offset="3659107">Moreover in taking our appeal to this Court in order to emphasize that we were seeking to avoid any problem as any sentencing problem, we purposely confined ourselves to an appeal from that portion of the order dismissing the indictment which related to the dismissal of the 4704 charge and that is all that is in the case as it comes to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.012" offset="6359437">And they base that from the fact that the District Court in setting out the Sixth Amendment in its opinion referred not only -- quoted “not only the language shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial” but went on to spoke proportion and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.254" offset="6460374">As I think I've earlier indicated the reasoning of the court is entirely directed to the question whether delays occurred, the law's delays which preclude a retrial, there is no suggestion that the indictment doesn't inform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.914" offset="6543026">Indeed the present indictment is most specific and it seems to us perfectly clear that the requirement -- the informing requirement have to be met in advance of trial and that it doesn't relate to whatever delays there may have been between the time of the offense and the time of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.410" offset="6632991">It is the function of the speedy trial requirement to assure that a case is processed with reasonable dispatch.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.176" offset="6688057">They say this was beholding of the Court and the government's notice of appeal was restricted to the question whether there was a denial of the right of speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.823" offset="6734660">I don't think that claim does stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.947" offset="6759111">Your Honors will note that the motions to dismiss the indictments in these cases were based on two grounds and two only, one, prior jeopardy, two, denial of the right of speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.601" offset="6821804">No reference was made to any claim that the indictment as presently drawn, did not sufficiently inform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.131" offset="6855868">Moreover, the opinion, the dispositive part of the opinion, is fortunately unusually clear in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.950" offset="6895156">Your Honors, will note at page 26 of the record, “the court now grants,” this is the District Court's order, “the amended motion to dismiss the indictment base on ground two and denies the motion as based on ground one.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.153" offset="6959940">As I've indicated the motions made no reference to any other kind of Sixth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.393" offset="6988988">The order in the companion case is precisely the same and so I think there is no question before the Court other than the question whether the attempt to retry the case results in the denial of a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.233" offset="7064325">We think that here clearly it is not and that the ordinary practice which prevails after a successful appeal or a successful collateral attack does permit retrial as the indictment here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.724" offset="10350320">I would like to briefly go back over what I think are the salient facts here because as the District Court found it was on the basis of looking at all of these facts that the --- he found the denial of these two constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.496" offset="10405386">Now, in the original proceeding as Mr. Chief Justice Warren has pointed out, the government had the right and the ability to indict Mr. Ewell on three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.471" offset="10441226">This would -- had not been prohibited by Gore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.047" offset="10451571">I mean it was permis -- made permissible by the Gore decision and for some reason, unknown of record they did not and then he relied on the Lauer decision and set his conviction aside, the government instead of appealing that case to the Seventh Circuit reprosecuted him this time with two additional counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.481" offset="10541328">And I think the outstanding fact in this whole case is found on page 25 of the record and I'm quoting from the District Court's opinion, “the government then from -- for some unknown reason of record other than the express concern of the prospective liberation of a number of similarly convicted narcotic felons calls a grand jury to indicting on the two extra counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.064" offset="10855633">Now on page 35 of the record, government's petition for rehearing, the government sets forth their reason for not appealing to this Court the dismissal of the counts one and two under the mandatory sentencing provisions because the problem that they recognize of crediting time under -- under these two particular counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.473" offset="10953226">I'd like to briefly touch on the subject of prejudice under these two counts and under the count under appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.268" offset="10980394">It was argued in the District Court on -- and this is seen on page 11 of the record in our brief in support the motion to dismiss that the defendant was prejudiced in the defense of the charges and by the harassment of the successive prosecution and it was further argued that because of the time served in -- on his prior indictment, the prejudice was particularly oppressive in this case because of the problems that the sentencing provisions rise as far as crediting time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.435" offset="11113096">Now the government did not at any time and I repeat did not at any time denied the existence of any of this prejudice or make any argument concerning the existence of prejudice and did not even argue that the government did not bare the burden of showing prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.128" offset="11167848">On the contrary, they gave recognition to the existence of a prejudice under these counts and offered to dismiss counts one and two upon a plea or a finding of guilty on -- on count two and it's probably on counts one and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.776" offset="11234513">Now the government comes before this Court and asks this Court to reverse the District Court on the mere unsupported assertion that it -- it does not appear that there's been any prejudice in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.961" offset="11283205">They further spend approximately 20% of their brief arguing that there's been no prejudice under counts one and three controverting their original position taken into petition for rehearing and in the jurisdictional statement and in their brief when they have not in fact appealed these two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.976" offset="11363244">Now we think that -- that we have made a showing and that there's a definite possibility of prejudice and I'd like to point out to the Court that it is not prejudice in fact that this Court must find or that the District Court must find but it's the possibility of prejudice, and decisions of this Court have so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.075" offset="11435656">Now as far as the speedy trial issue and I'm addressing myself to count two alone because this was the count that the government has appealed to this Court, you have the -- the bare facts of a alleged crime on October 31, an arrest on December 12 and the defendant was not charged with the violation of count two until March 26, 1964 delayed some 17 months, all this time he's in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.913" offset="11543071">Now it's clear that the defendant has a right to a speedy trial even though he's in jail and the reas -- the reason for this is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.522" offset="11569507">The right to a speedy trial is intended to protect the defendant from harm that may arise in defending himself due to the passage of time and this of course applies equally well to a defendant who has to be in jail and one who is -- is out on his own recognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.545" offset="11629589">As a matter of fact, I think it's more important for a defendant who's in jail to have his rights speedily prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.889" offset="11666892">Now the government argues in its brief that the defendant's right to a speedy trial on count two begins with the filing of the second indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.790" offset="11694582">We think this is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.639" offset="11705971">In the recent case, Henry Hahn case in the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, this is a -- a very same argument was rejected as one of the exalts form over substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.701" offset="11758216">And to hold otherwise that actually give the government the power to evade the responsibility to bring the defendant to trial on these charges by filing successive indictments, charging different crimes arising from the same act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.387" offset="11812968">Now it further say that -- that the delay should be excused because it was brought about by the defendants setting aside of his original conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.110" offset="11851839">Well, as the District Court found the reason that they added these two charges on was in effect a collateral attack on the Lauer decision and this is a bad reason in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.487" offset="11905337">In the recent opinion in the Second Circuit, the then Justice Marshall but now Honorable Solicitor General in speaking of -- of this situation in an appeal context, said by placing this on consumable premium upon a successful appeal by an accused a vital suicidal interest is threatened assuring that liberty shall not be deprived without a trial free from legal error prejudicing the accused's substantial rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.014" offset="12247437">Under the one that the government has appealed, there is a prejudice concerning the failure to inform the defendant of the charge under 4705(a), in fact that the time began running when the original indictment was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.254" offset="12296338">Now, the prejudice resulting from the delay under 4705(a) is of course the prejudice that this Court is recognizing in the mandatory sentencing provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3650.334" offset="14704724">I'd like to briefly reply to Mr. Spritzer's argument that there has been no showing of prejudice in the record on this account under 4705(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.187" offset="14752162">Now under the Narcotics Act, the case is recognized that even the slightest delay, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals recently held in the Rochelle case that a delay of seven months from the date of the commission of the crime until the date of the charge was alleged was a denial of due process and the reason was because of the particular area we're dealing in the Narcotics Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.107" offset="14847770">Now under this area the slightest amount of prejudice or slightest amount of delay can -- can result in an extreme prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.772" offset="14878490">And this is because of the presumptions of guilt contained in these statutes and the methods used in enforcing the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.198" offset="14912136">Now for instance, under 4705(a), a crime is charged only for the sale of narcotics to a person who does not possess the proper written order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.562" offset="14953618">Under this count the presence or absence of the tax stamp package referred to in count two of this indictment, the count before this Court is completely irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.113" offset="14991862">Now you have a high hypothetical case of a man charged with 4705(a), count one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.550" offset="15013595">He pleads guilty and that after he's been incarcerated in prison for 15 months for the first time he's charged for the violation of 4704(a), the stamped package charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.944" offset="15055182">Under Mr. Justice Clark's opinion in the Harris case, the narcotics could be introduced in the evidence and the presumption then was presume the absence of a tax stamped package.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.473" offset="15101262">The defendant being in jail and informed that he has to -- rebut this charge lodged for the first time after a considerable delay, might find it impossible because of the presumptions here to prove his innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.965" offset="15151208">So I think that there is inherent in the situation here in these two particular statutes the possibility of extreme prejudice that might result from even the slightest delay.</text>

            <label>Mr. David B. Lockton</label>
            <text syncTime="3994.577" offset="16081690">And I don't even cover these counts in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.388" offset="16100916">I'd like to point out what we feel would be the consequences of a reversal in this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.707" offset="16122232">The government has framed its argument in broad terms stating that the decision below stands for the proposition that persons who spend time in prison under avoidable conviction may not be tried again on the successive indictment after a collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.359" offset="16184822">But we don't see on the complicated facts in this case and the -- and the many issues of Lauer raised by these facts as it can possibly be read by this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.975" offset="16223274">On the other hand, we think that a reversal of this decision might stem from the following propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.511" offset="16249396">That the government has the right to add charges on to a successive second indictment which it was held from the first for the purposes of discouraging other defendants from collaterally attacking their appeals as the District Court notes in page 26 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.615" offset="16313866">It might further stem for the proposition that the right to a speedy trial does not arise from the date of the offense or even -- even from the date of the first indictment but rather that the government can in effect stop the time running by filing the second indictment and -- and have a time and run from the date of the second indictment till the date of the prosecution just contrary to -- to many decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.008" offset="16407385">Further more, I think it would search the question the holding of -- of this Court in the Ponzi case that the defendant has the right to a speedy trial always in jail and on another charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.449" offset="16445210">In filing we think that the record before this Court which does not present the evidence against the defendant and which it contains notes denial of prejudice on the part -- on the part of the government is inadequate so that this Court inadequate so inadequate that this Court cannot find that there was no possibility of prejudice existing before the District Court when it made its decision and therefore confined that the District Court was clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.312" offset="16560671">Now on the other hand, we have argued on the merits that the record can only support some finding of the failure to inform which is part two in our brief and the right to a speedy trial, and the double jeopardy argument which we think is also raised by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.345" offset="16624724">Furthermore, we have raised the jurisdictional point of case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.504" offset="16649383">Now the government in their jurisdictional statement appealed merely defining that the -- the defendant have been denied its right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.819" offset="16690657">The District Court however found that there was a denial of two separate rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.319" offset="16708629">But we think this can be read and supported by the record below in the basis of his particular concern that the addition of these charges after a delay of time solely for the purpose of discouraging others similarly situated narcotic felons and also in his express statement that the -- the following rights of the Sixth Amendment were denied by the prosecutions below and in quoting “the right to a speedy trial and the right to be informed for the nature and cause of the accusation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.366" offset="16840808">Rule -- under the rules of this Court, the government is precluded from raising points which are not properly presented in the jurisdictional statement and the government has not argued the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation anywhere in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.530" offset="16909458">We think the record clearly supports this position and therefore any opinion of the Court might present on the right to a speedy trial would leave this independent ground standing below and therefore would not affect the defendant's freedom and would be an advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.870" offset="16962853">We therefore feel that the appeal does not present the proper case or controversy required to give the Court jurisdiction and we think that the case can be disposed off in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.547" offset="16997543">Thank you.</text>
