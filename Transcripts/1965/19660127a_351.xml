            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 351, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Petitioner versus Walter F. Tellier, et ux.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.848" offset="238738">Mr. Levin.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Jack S. Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="35.333" offset="244694">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.283" offset="256502">This income tax case presents the question whether a taxpayer who has been convicted of a criminal offense arising out of his business activities may take a deduction on his income tax return for the expenses incurred in defending against the criminal prosecution which resulted in conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.781" offset="354513">Respondent was in the business of underwriting and selling securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.018" offset="379486">He was indicted in a Federal District Court on 36 counts charging that he had knowingly and intentionally made false and fraudulent representations which induced the public to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in an insolvent enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.745" offset="458376">The indictment charged violations of three federal statutes, the fraud provision of the Securities Act of 1933, the mail fraud statute and the federal conspiracy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.907" offset="518980">After a full trial to a jury, respondent was convicted on all 36 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.770" offset="546461">The judge sentenced him to four-and-a-half years imprisonment on each count, the sentence is to run concurrently, and a total fine of $18,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.258" offset="588361">In connection with his defense of this criminal prosecution, petitioner -- respondent paid his attorney approximately $23,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.687" offset="634128">This case concerns the question whether he can deduct that approximately $23,000 from his other income.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.767" offset="678431">The Tax Court following an administrative and judicial rule of approximately 40-year standing disallowed the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.734" offset="722317">The Second Circuit en banc overruled a number of that court's prior decisions and held that the $23,000 incurred in connection with the criminal prosecution was in fact deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.750" offset="794415">The governing statute in this case is Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which is the general provision allowing a deduction for ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying on a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.361" offset="868812">The position of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue which has enjoyed at least 40 years of consistent judicial acceptance both in the trial courts and the Court of Appeals is that expenses incurred in defending against a criminal prosecution which results in the taxpayer's conviction are not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.901" offset="962957">This position is bottomed upon the public policy expressed in the statute which the taxpayer is convicted of violating.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.790" offset="1010500">The Commissioner in the courts had, at various times, expressed this theory in a couple of different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.471" offset="1045295">At times, they have said that the expenses are not ordinary and necessary and other times they have stated that the expenses are nondeductible because they violate the public policy expressed by the state legislature or by Congress in enacting the criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.784" offset="1122513">In essence, regardless of the way of phrasing it, the Commissioner believes that the theory of nondeductibility is premised upon the public policy ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.015" offset="1179460">That is that Congress or the state legislature in prohibiting criminal acts could not have been intending that a taxpayer receive a deduction for his expenses of resisting a suit which results in his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.756" offset="1250408">In this case, the Solicitor General in the brief has expressed some doubts as to whether the public policy doctrine, which as I will point out in a moment this Court has accepted in other contexts in tax cases, extends to the disallowance of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.332" offset="1328671">However, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue declined to abandon this position which had long standing support in the cases both trial and appellate, and therefore, the Solicitor General has applied for certiorari which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.713" offset="1398262">During the course of this argument, I will attempt to set forth the reasoning which underlies both the position of the Commissioner and the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.855" offset="1442774">However, before doing that, I would like to deal with two preliminary statutory questions which I think will put the public policy question in proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.813" offset="1490631">First, Section 262 of the Internal Revenue Code specifically states that no deduction shall be allowed for personal expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.414" offset="1528978">While it can be argued that the expenses of attempting to avoid a criminal conviction and possible imprisonment are personal in nature, the Commissioner does not believe that this case can be disposed of on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.829" offset="1586657">In a number of cases involving the deductibility of attorney's fees incurred in defending civil lawsuits, this Court has recognized that whether the expenses of resisting a lawsuit are to be regarded as personal or business in nature depends on the type of activities out of which the claim arose, rather than upon the consequences losing a suit would have on the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.283" offset="1700551">For example, if the taxpayer engaged in the business of delivering packages is involved in an accident and defend the tort suit arising out of that accident, his expenses of resisting the damage claim would be deductible, because the origin of the suit would be his business activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.300" offset="1780590">Whereas if the same taxpayer was on the way to a cocktail party was engaged in an automobile accident, his expenses of resisting a lawsuit would be personal in nature.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="430.803" stopTime="437.465">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="430.803" offset="1826565">Suppose you're on the way to a business, to a friend of yours to plainly discuss the business and he had an automobile accident?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_s_levin" startTime="437.465" stopTime="488.438">
            <label>Mr. Jack S. Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="437.465" offset="1853210">I think that undoubtedly there is -- there is room here as in most other tax questions for argument as to whether the activities were in fact personal or business in nature in closed cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.973" offset="1907231">There is no such question in this case where the taxpayer's activities which led to this criminal indictment and conviction were attempts to sell security which in fact he did so approximately $700,000 or $800,000 worth and received commission to total $540,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.643" offset="1985912">So his activities which gave rise to this lawsuit were clearly business in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.759" offset="2010363">The question -- undoubtedly, there are cases where there could be some doubt as to whether the activities were sufficiently business in nature so that your expense in resisting lawsuit would be business rather than personal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="488.438" stopTime="492.884">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="488.438" offset="2057174">I see.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.856" offset="2058846">This is business in nature if it's nondeductible.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_s_levin" startTime="492.884" stopTime="656.300">
            <label>Mr. Jack S. Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="492.884" offset="2074937">Yes, and we take that position not on the ground that the expense is personal in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.543" offset="2097507">The Commissioner concedes that in this case the expenses of resisting a lawsuit are business in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.556" offset="2129586">The second ground, the second statutory question is the meaning of the words 'ordinary' and 'necessary', because in order for a business expenditure to be deductible, it must be ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.436" offset="2181099">That's the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.352" offset="2188831">Now, this Court has interpreted the words ordinary and necessary, as have the lower courts quite liberally in order to effectuate their purpose and has interpreted them to include in general any expenditures which the taxpayer reasonably expects to further his profit-making purpose, his profit-making business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.976" offset="2287261">There are, however, two questions which arise in relation to this ordinary and necessary phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.354" offset="2320802">The first is that in a 1940 opinion of this Court, the Deputy versus Du Pont, which the Commissioner has at time cited and which the lower courts have also cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.177" offset="2360090">This Court used language to the following effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.272" offset="2372420">And he said that in order for an expenditure to be ordinary, it must be of common or frequent occurrence in the type of business involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.333" offset="2404707">Now, if that test is correct and if that is the law, then we believe that the expenses here in question would have to be disallowed, because as I just stated in answer to Mr. Justice Fortas' question, the expenses of resisting a lawsuit must be viewed in light of the activities which gave rise to the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.185" offset="2484120">And here, the expenses of the lawsuit were occasioned by the taxpayer's criminal fraud in his securities business.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.713" offset="2522258">And since criminal fraud is certainly not common or frequent in the securities business of this nation, it becomes necessary to decide whether frequency is actually an essential ingredient of the phrase 'ordinary and necessary'.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.815" offset="2578683">As spelled out in more detail in our brief, we do not believe that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.062" offset="2599581">For if expenses were to be disallowed whenever the activities of the type engaged in by the taxpayer were not common or frequent in his business or industry, we think this rationale would apply in cases not involving criminal violations at all but would tend to discourage business initiative and innovation.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.502" offset="2681396">A result that certainly is not suggested or compelled by either the statutory language, the purpose or the legislative history of the relevant code provisions.</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="656.300" offset="2728521">Does the record show whether the respondent was engaged in a general securities business or was this an isolated transaction?</text>

            <text syncTime="669.748" offset="2782333">The record is rather scanty, Your Honor, but we have cited in our brief in a footnote, the Second Circuit's opinion affirming his criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.719" offset="2830294">And in that case, the facts are set forth at much greater length, but also the facts in the record are also ample to demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.183" offset="2868120">The taxpayer was regularly engaged in the securities business.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.541" offset="2885569">He employed 25 to 30 salesmen who were, I believe from the record, mainly on his premises making telephone calls and attempting to induce costumers to purchase securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1112.763" offset="4554376">In 1943, this Court had the case of Heininger versus the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.020" offset="4575483">There the taxpayer had incurred attorney's fees in resisting an administrative fraud order issued by the postal department banning him from using the mails in his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.175" offset="4628041">And the Commissioner and the Solicitor General took the position that the public policy expressed by the postal statute there in question prevented a deduction for attorney's fees incurred in unsuccessfully resisting this fraud order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.007" offset="4695437">This Court in that case carefully examined the postal statute in question and concluded that the statute was designed solely “to protect the public” and that it was not designed “to impose personal punishment on violators”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.853" offset="4758758">Therefore, this Court held that Heininger had not been judicially determined to have violated a criminal or penal statute and that his expenses were deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.703" offset="4810167">At the same time, this Court expressed in a footnote the following thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.723" offset="4834304">A taxpayer who has been hurt and prosecuted under a federal or state statute and convicted of a crime has not been permitted a tax deduction for his attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.753" offset="4878399">And this Court then quote, cited the decisions, some of the decisions of the lower courts which had consistently so held.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.768" offset="6758484">This Court as well as the other courts had disallowed certain expenditures violating public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.789" offset="6790562">This Court's decision of course didn't come from 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.706" offset="6802160">If the lower courts consistently disallowed the three categorical sentences that are illegal payments such as bribes, criminal fines and penalties and attorney's fees during that period, the code was repeatedly reenacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.105" offset="6867780">The general words ordinary and necessary which have been read is including a public policy exception were retained unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.394" offset="6892962">In fact in 1958, Congress adopted a new section -- subsection to 162 the expense deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.125" offset="6927862">It said that the expense of paying bribes to foreign officials will henceforth be nondeductible and the Committee Report show we believe that Congress was assuming that bribes paid to domestic officials were nondeductible but that there was some question about foreign officials since they didn't -- such bribes didn't violate American law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.500" offset="7017409">So Congress there in 1958 was quite clearly assuming that this Court and the lower courts insistent disallowance of such illegal payments were nondeductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.542" offset="7077491">In the same year, 1958, this Court decided the Tank Truck case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.348" offset="7096717">In that case, the taxpayer had repeatedly been convicted of violating state overweight truck laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.533" offset="7125556">And the case did not involve attorney's fees but only the payment of criminal fines in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.560" offset="7157635">And this Court held in 1958 in Tank Truck that criminal fines were nondeductible because they violated public policy the same time this Court clearly stated that payments such as bribes which are themselves illegal were also nondeductible because they violated the sharply defined public policy embodied in the criminal statute which had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.221" offset="7252302">And this Court said that Congress could not be presumed to have intended when it enacted this general expense section to allow a deduction for an expenditure which was intimately related o a criminal act in which -- but only if the expenditure was remote, and this Court used the word 'remote' from the illegal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.546" offset="7333595">It's the Commissioner's position here that the attorney's fees incurred in a criminal proceeding in which the taxpayer is convicted far from being only remotely related to the illegal act are intimately related both to the taxpayer's illegal conduct and to the nondeductible fine levied upon conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.414" offset="7425024">The expenses here in question were after all incurred in the very proceeding between respondent and the sovereign in which his guilt was determined and in which he was punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.774" offset="7470477">And the Commissioner takes the position that the strong public policy expressed by three federal statutes here in question requires the disallowance of his fees in litigating just as much as it requires the disallowance of the $18,000 fine which was levied against him upon conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.403" offset="7744972">In fact, in most cases allowing a deduction would bear -- the benefit of allowing a deduction would bear an inverse relationship to the tax benefit afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.651" offset="7797948">The higher the taxpayer's income, of course, the higher his tax bracket; the higher this tax bracket, the greater the benefit he'll receive from a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.209" offset="7828250">In other words, if a man incurs $20,000 worth of attorney's fees and he's in the 80% bracket or the 70% bracket, he gets a $14,000 tax subsidy so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.189" offset="7872136">If he's in the 10% or 20% bracket, his tax subsidy is only 20% of his attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.927" offset="7899094">Therefore, we would come out with the result of allowing a deduction here that the higher the taxpayer's income, the higher his tax bracket, the greater his benefit from the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.035" offset="7947473">The man with the large income who least needs a federal subsidy to guarantee his constitutional right to counsel would get the largest amount of tax benefit, while the man who has little or no income and who most needs federal help would get the smallest tax rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.362" offset="8448815">Well I'll rest on the point set forth in the brief such as the Cammarano case that clearly shows that expenditures which are related to a constitutional right are not necessarily deductible merely because there is a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.103" offset="8507747">Respondent himself concedes that attorney's fees incurred in defending a criminal prosecution arising out of personal acts are not deductible despite the fact that there's a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.334" offset="8552678">Let me set forth for just one moment the Solicitor General's position which I've mentioned but not given the -- his reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.981" offset="8591339">His reasoning is that the constitutional right to retain counsel while it does not necessarily require a deduction may well be considered as one of the policies mitigating in favor of a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.223" offset="8644315">Moreover, the Solicitor General finds it difficult to believe that anyone about to engage in criminal activities would be encouraged to engage in those activities merely because he knows that his expenses of retaining counsel if he's caught and convicted will be deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.845" offset="8710771">And finally that allowing a deduction for attorney's fees arising out of a business crime would give them no more or no better treatment than other business-related expenditures, and thus that public policy ground invoked by the Commissioner while it has been consistently accepted for 40 years by the courts during reenactment does not apply as strongly here as it does to the cases that this Court has already upheld such as illegal bribes and criminal fines assessed by a court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.214" offset="9384208">In the Lilly case, opticians were granting a 33.3% kickback, as I recall, to a prescribing doctor who sent a prescription there to be filled for eyeglasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.548" offset="9457560">It was a kickback to the prescribing doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.462" offset="9469262">The Commissioner and the Solicitor General took the position that these kickbacks were nondeductible so far as the payer, the company that makes the glasses is concerned, on the ground that sharply defined public policy prevented such a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.889" offset="9538957">This Court in that case held that there was no governmentally enunciated public policy which was violated by this practice, no state statute, no federal statute, perhaps it was found upon by the AMA, but it was not a sharply defined governmentally enunciated public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.011" offset="9619414">Therefore, this Court allowed the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.437" offset="9633102">Later in the Tank Truck case where this Court found that the activities violated state statutes, they are overweight truck statutes, this Court invoked the public policy doctrine and confirmed the lower courts 40 years of consistent use of that doctrine at least to the extent of disallowing criminal fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.662" offset="9718053">Here, the Commissioner takes the position that the three federal statutes here involved which were all violated by the respondent for which he was convicted and sentenced of violating, express a very strong public policy which requires the disallowance of the deductions here in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.227" offset="9836231">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.417" offset="9857024">Before commencing on the argument itself, I should like to point out to the Court that there are two things wrong in which the statements made by the representative of the Solicitor General's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.179" offset="9920136">The first thing is that the issue of ordinary and necessary expenses is definitely not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.510" offset="9945422">It was admitted at every stage below that these expenses are the proximate result of the taxpayer's business within the full leading of Kornhauser against the United States and Bingham's Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.362" offset="10012818">The only issue involved in this case is whether there is such a thing as overriding public policy which operates to destroy a taxpayer's right to a deduction which he would ordinarily without any question be entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.509" offset="10081364">The second thing that I should like to say to the Court is that in this very recent reply brief served only yesterday, the Solicitor General seeks to prove that my statement that since the time of Heininger and up to the time when the Commissioner reversed the G.C.M. and substituted the revenue ruling that he has followed a consistent program of disallowing these deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.006" offset="10211349">What he has failed to tell the Court is that the case that he cites, the Tax Court case Green Motor Company against Commissioner 5 T.C. 314 is an acquiesced case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.447" offset="10257115">Now, the Court is aware that the position of the Commissioner is determined not from the overzealous efforts of local counsel in the Tax Court but by what the Commissioner does with the decision when it comes down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.084" offset="10307688">It happens and is very clear that in this case the Commissioner acquiesced and the acquiescence is in 1945 (c) (b) page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.315" offset="10344678">Now, the bare unvarnished fact is that this acquiescence could not have occurred had the revenue ruling been in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.377" offset="10396923">Have the revenue ruling been effect the Commissioner would have been obliged to non-acquiesce of the case and take it for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.199" offset="10440182">Now, the reply brief always also cites a good deal of what the late Judge Clark used to call the chit-chat in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.500" offset="10481351">It is very true that the Tax Court in the Green Motor Company made all the statements that the Solicitor General says it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.051" offset="10523564">But that's not the ruling of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.780" offset="10534536">The ruling of the case is identical in Longhorn Portland Cement Company as it is in Green Motor Company, and the ruling is that the Commissioner's reliance either on Helvering against Superior Wines &amp; Liquor or on Outdoor Advertising is misplaced because those are the specific cases which this Court reversed in the Commissioner against Heininger when it grant us certiorari in that latter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.456" offset="10665148">Now, there is indeed a very important question of public policy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.332" offset="10692733">However, it's not the public policy question that the Solicitor General has outlined in behalf of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.767" offset="10738395">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue urges this Court to disallow attorney fees in the case of a lost criminal defense solely for the reason that he says that it is necessary in order to discourage criminality, to discourage the Commission of criminal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.486" offset="10821360">There are two defects of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.249" offset="10832332">Number one as this Court has said in Commissioner against Heininger, there is a complete lack of direct cause and effect between the use of counsel, the employment of counsel and the Commission of illegal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.981" offset="10899310">And second, perhaps even more important is the fact that that never has been the reason for the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.109" offset="10927835">Now, I refer the Court, respectfully refer the Court to the late Judge Learned Hand's decision in Rossman against Commissioner reported at 175 F.2d. 711 in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.204" offset="10984155">In that case, Judge Learned Hand referred to the rule which had existed in the Second Circuit before Commissioner against Heininger, the rule that disallowed attorney fees in civil cases where the defendant was employing counsel in a vain effort to avoid the imposition of civil fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.921" offset="11083107">Judge Learned Hand said, “Indeed to hold otherwise would be to subsidize the obduracy of those offenders who were unwilling to pay without a contest and who therefore added impenitence to their offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.360" offset="11148831">And for this reason in the decisions just cited we held that such legal expenses were never deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.783" offset="11178506">Of course, Judge Learned Hand also hastened to add that this Court in Commissioner against Heininger had rejected that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.515" offset="11209435">But it's the great merit of Judge Hand's decision that he unabashedly faced the real purpose of the rule, so-called rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.914" offset="11251022">The real purpose of that rule was to inhibit the use of counsel in an effort to defend against charges of criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.550" offset="11297520">Now, it's unfortunate that Judge Hand --</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.000" offset="11403368">But however, the facts still remains that Judge Hand unashamedly faced the reason for the rule and he said the Second Circuit disallows attorney fees because we want to discourage the employment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.469" offset="11461256">Now, it's unfortunate that the late Judge Hand used the word subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.451" offset="11489155">He said that it would -- he said to hold otherwise would be to subsidize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.352" offset="11504828">But the label which Judge Hand used is of relative unimportance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.908" offset="11526980">It's a relative unimportance because if it is a subsidy to allow a deduction where a defendant is successful, where a defendant is not successful it is just as much as subsidy to allow it where the defendant fails, or by getting it twisted, it doesn't make any difference whether the defendant has succeeded or failed, there's a subsidy in either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.435" offset="11625096">And the bare fact remains that if the defendant looses, he loses a subsidy, if it is called a subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.426" offset="11653099">So it makes no difference whether we call it a right to an allowance or whether we call it a subsidy, the fact that the defendant has lost a case in court and causes the imposition of a substantial tax penalty, a sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.121" offset="11719868">Now that, Your Honors, is the true question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.799" offset="11734601">The true question of public policy is whether we have reached such a point or whether the mores of our community has reached such a point that we are going to penalize a man because he has failed to win vindication in a court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.763" offset="11794474">I think that this Court answered that question in Commissioner against Heininger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.060" offset="11811610">I think that when this Court in Commissioner against Heininger said it is not the purpose of the statutes for which the defendant had violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.417" offset="11845047">It was never the purpose of those statutes to deter him from using counsel in defense against such charges, this Court meant to say that it is never the purpose of any statute to deter a man from using counsel in defense whether the case is criminal or whether the case is civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.005" offset="11931355">Certainly, it would be a tremendous inconsistency if this Court were to say that when a man is charged with guilt in an administrative proceeding, it is not the function of any statute to deny him the right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.605" offset="13177814">I would answer Your Honor's question that he is entitled to the deduction but for another reason Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.064" offset="13199653">The reason being that since the Government taxes him on his profit from being offense as the Court puts it, the Government has no right to tax his gross receipts, the income tax law permits the Government to tax only the net income, permits the Commissioner to tax only the net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.973" offset="13275303">And if by reason of the fact that this man is offense, the Government should tax his gross receipts rather than his net income, then the sanction which would be imposed upon him might be tremendous depending upon how much expenses he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.510" offset="13333400">And nowhere does any statute of the United States say that a man should be punished in addition to the punishment which is imposed by the crime -- by the statutes describing the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.818" offset="13378644">He should, in addition, be punished by the disallowance of all his expenses so that he is obliged to pay a tax out of money that he no longer has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.285" offset="13412498">And that is the reason Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.243" offset="13420335">I think that the question of whether or not the taxpayer is engaged in an illegal business is not relevant to the matter because we are trying to tax economic profit that a man makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.917" offset="13471013">The whole theory of the income tax law is that the Government will share the profit that the taxpayer makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.721" offset="13498284">Taking a certain proportion in accordance with law and leaving the balance for that man to spend as he wishes or to save if he wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.143" offset="13531930">Now, the moment that you disallow expenses, you destroy that percentage between the Government, and if Your Honor please, I could give you the illustration of a man who pays $100,000 for stolen cars, sells them for $110,000 and if the Commissioner disallows the $100,000, his tax would be 52% of $110,000 not $10,000 which is his profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.116" offset="13631822">The fact remains Your Honor that the income tax is a peculiarly unfitted law for the punishment of crime because the income tax law does not punish in accordance with crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.215" offset="13684276">It punishes by taking that which does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.371" offset="13696815">It punishes by taking income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.630" offset="13705906">Now, if I bring the case down to the particular of my own situation here, if Mr. Tellier had spent $100,000 in attorney fees to save his business having received only $110,000 in receipts, if we disallow the $100,000, we bring him to a 75% price on a $110,000 which is obviously more than he ever had in his life out of that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.706" offset="13798170">In other words, the penalty is not in accordance with the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.027" offset="13815515">Moreover, the penalty has the propensity of bankrupting an individual depending upon how large the expenses as being disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.316" offset="13848639">Now, in this case, Mr. Tellier's attorney fees in 1954 were small.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.295" offset="13872567">That doesn't mean they were not larger in other years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.132" offset="13883852">The fact remains that if we disallow the attorney fees, we have created income and having created income, we are taxing that which does not exist and we're taxing it under the guise of a penalty to prevent this man from doing further -- from engaging in criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.429" offset="13957099">That is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.570" offset="13961697">We're -- what we are taking from him is his right to be defended in a court, because we're making it impossible for him to pay for attorney fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.749" offset="13998373">If a man who has received $110,000 and is required to pay $100,000 for attorney fees is denied a deduction for the $100,000 he simply doesn't have the assets to pay the attorney fees.</text>
