            <label>Mr. Richard M. Nixon</label>
            <text syncTime="25.380" offset="179458">Mr. Justice Harlan, I'll be glad to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.630" offset="188444">And preliminary to that, if it may please the Court, could I respond to two questions and elaborate on them that were raised yesterday, one by Mr. Justice Black and another that was raised by Mr. Justice Brennan and also incidentally by Mr. Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.349" offset="259392">With regard to the questions raised by Mr. Justice Black, you will refer that in my opening argument, I referred to the article “Fiction out of Fact” which had appeared in the New York Times Magazine in which the author of the play, “The Desperate Hours”, Mr. Hayes, had stated that the -- that there were four different incidents which had inspired the play.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.855" offset="357404">And that as far as the final product was concerned that it was unlike any of the incidents about which he had read.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.677" offset="388646">One of those incidents was the incident in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.696" offset="400767">Mr. Justice Black questioned me about what he said was an earlier article referring to two instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.515" offset="435980">The earlier article I have before me and I refer the Court to that article which appears on page 427 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.971" offset="481851">That article was not in the file of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.119" offset="502436">It therefore does not bear on the knowledge that defendant had when he wrote the play or -- or the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.368" offset="539425">But the article is significant, it seems, on the basic point as to the question as to whether “The Desperate Hours”, the -- the article, “The Desperate Hours” -- on “The Desperate Hours” in Time Magazine and the book and the play were reenactments of Hill incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.307" offset="619151">For example, if the Court will turn to that page, it will find that Mr. Hill refers to three different instances which he said caught his imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.146" offset="662514">One was the fact that he lived near a correctional institution in Danbury, Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.771" offset="681009">And he wondered, “What if there were a prisonbreak and one or more of these desperate men escape in that direction?”</text>
            <text syncTime="157.112" offset="706400">Then he said he had read newspaper accounts a year before describing an occurrence in New York State not far away.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.799" offset="737120">In this occurrence, there was a hostage instances in which there was “subsequent and inevitable violence in which a man had stabbed a child to death.”</text>
            <text syncTime="176.539" offset="784140">And then I quote, “Shortly after this, or perhaps a month or two before, three men escaped from a prison even further away from my secure and comfortable home.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.144" offset="826563">Holding a family hostage, they hid there eating and sleeping and then left without violence, without the inevitable bloodshed.”</text>

            <text syncTime="281.320" offset="1203249">His question was, “In the event that they had used the word ‘reminiscent' and then had described the Hill incident as it have occurred, would there had been a liability?”</text>
            <text syncTime="290.871" offset="1241387">And my answer was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.777" offset="1249015">But that is not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.739" offset="1256852">In this particular instance, they said that the Hill incident was a reenactment and they've said it not only by one word but they've said it by all of the pictures including the six pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.936" offset="1293737">And my point is that those six pictures do relate to what violence and bloodshed.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.398" offset="1323516">And I come again to the article in the author's own words, that as far as the particular incident to which he refers in this particular article is concerned, that it was distinguished from the incident in New York because they hid there, eating and sleeping and then left without violence and without inevitable bloodshed.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.427" offset="1403660">And it has been our argument and our contention throughout this case that The Desperate Hours, the heart of The Desperate Hours, is a story of violence and bloodshed, that the heart of the Hill incident was the fact that it was one that was distinguished by a lack of violence and bloodshed.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.823" offset="1477221">And here, we have it in the author's own words.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.832" offset="1489237">Now, a second point that Mr. Justice Black raise, however, I think also should be commented upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.181" offset="1514628">He referred quite properly to the fact that Mr. Hayes had been present at the time that the pictures were taken in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.140" offset="1558514">When those pictures were taken in the house, however, it is significant to note what went on in terms of whether the representatives of the defendant discussed with Mr. Hayes the basic question as to whether the article which was eventually to be written, or at that point, The Desperate Hours which -- about which pictures were to be taken, whether The Desperate Hours was a reenactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.155" offset="1674602">And on that score, I refer the Court to page 124 of the record to these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.324" offset="1699262">“Very briefly, Mr. Hayes, would you tell the jury whether or not The Desperate Hours is the story of or reenactment of the Life episode?”</text>
            <text syncTime="413.177" offset="1730609">Answer, “It is not a story of, it is not a reenactment of that episode.”</text>
            <text syncTime="417.789" offset="1749103">Question, and this is the connected one, “Did anybody from Life Magazine ever asked you whether it was?”</text>
            <text syncTime="424.656" offset="1776584">Answer, “No, they did not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="426.716" offset="1784839">Question, “Did you ever tell anyone from Life Magazine that it was?”</text>
            <text syncTime="430.399" offset="1799572">Answer, “I did not.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.840" offset="4525293">And it is not the case in libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.192" offset="4534697">I would suggest, Mr. Justice Fortas, that libel -- the libel law going back in the -- in the common law goes back be -- about -- between 400 and 500 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.088" offset="4570328">And still today, even in this Court, there is the debate between the definers and those who believe there should be a balancing test as far as libel is concerned as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out in his (Inaudible) lecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.873" offset="4625394">That decision has not yet been made, and this Court has other cases on the question of libel as to what the rule should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.913" offset="4673564">This field started when, 60 years ago, in the State of New York, 63 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.231" offset="4694880">What I am saying here is that here, there is an interest, privacy, like the interest of reputation which is involved in libel which a State should have the right to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.163" offset="4746602">There is, of course, the interest of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.266" offset="4759036">And if this interest is to be protected, it must be consisted with, of course, the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.299" offset="4779098">That's the problem in the libel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.782" offset="4785054">That's the problem that this Court considered and ruled upon in Sullivan, Rosenblatt and Baer, Layne and Garrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.525" offset="4812013">It's also the problem in this privacy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.585" offset="4824238">Now, there have been statements made to the effect that the law in New York clearly apart from its application to this case, and this is Mr. Justice Brennan's point, that the law in New York is too uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.555" offset="4888186">It -- it leaves hanging over, prospective publishers in the future doubt as to what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.226" offset="4922876">And that basically would raise a very grave First Amendment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.946" offset="4937714">And also, it leaves a question as to whether the law might be applied in a future case in an unconstitutional way even though this Court might find, and under the facts of this case, it was applied constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.286" offset="4987138">Now, let me comment on that briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.046" offset="4998109">In 63 years, the courts of New York, in interpreting this statute, have recognized the newsworthy privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.701" offset="5036770">In 63 years, there has never been a reported criminal conviction under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.072" offset="5070207">In 63 years, there has never been a reported holding of liability for a current news story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.848" offset="5109286">And in 63 years, there has never been a case reported in which liability was held for a truthful account of a newsworthy item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.190" offset="5166756">Now, let me refer to the last point which has been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.338" offset="5179294">The first two I do not think have been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.127" offset="5190475">A truthful account of a newsworthy item, the leading case there is the one that Mr. Medina has mentioned as his leading case, the Blumenthal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.003" offset="5226001">Now, let's look at Mrs. Blumenthal for just a moment if we may, not for six seconds but for maybe two minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.888" offset="5253482">Mrs. Blumenthal goes back to an era in movies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.820" offset="5273231">Before, we have the great three-hour features in which it was not necessary to have any added inducements to bring people into the motion picture theatres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.271" offset="5311056">In those days in the early theatres in the year -- in the early 1930's as you may recall when you went to the movies.Usually, there was a feature movie of about an hour and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.788" offset="5353061">Then there was a newsreel, and third, there was the comedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.719" offset="5376780">Now, what does the New York courts hold on this particular instance?</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.718" offset="5388796">In here, we have, I think, an indication of the precision and a great care which the New York courts have exercised in applying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.990" offset="5425890">You cannot read Blumenthal without reading Humiston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.329" offset="5439265">Humiston decided in 1919.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.871" offset="5449400">Humiston was a newsreel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.436" offset="5459640">And there, a lawyer who was the subject of a newsworthy item saw his picture in front of a movie theatre advertising the newsreel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.997" offset="5497884">The courts held that because it dealt with a newsworthy item that there was no liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.552" offset="5528186">That was the newsreel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.724" offset="5536858">Now, we come to Blumenthal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.835" offset="5541247">What is Blumenthal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.886" offset="5545531">Blumenthal was not a travel log, it was not a newsreel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.050" offset="5562145">Blumenthal involved four comics and the picture was advertised in the theatres in this case incidentally has Nick and Toni Ace Funsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.706" offset="5604777">Four comics, two of them played the parts of guides and two, the parts of school teachers who traveled for 15 minutes around New York and made comments about what the passing scene showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.279" offset="5655036">And for six seconds, they put Mrs. Blumenthal on the screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.152" offset="5678547">Now, there may be questions as to whether comments were made about Mrs. Blumenthal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.128" offset="5698504">Counsel for the appellant suggests that they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.184" offset="5710729">That is not the heart of the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.894" offset="5721492">In a production, which is not a reported news, in other words, a newsreel or -- and cases of Gautier, in a production, a television production, which is not showing the plaintiff in the particular capacity in which he attended that particular event which was involved, but in a -- what is strictly a commercial venture having nothing to do with news, are we going to say that Mrs. Blumenthal is to be used as a prop for commercial purposes as an extra without her consent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.586" offset="5880316">I don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.292" offset="5887108">And that is what this case has said and I think it's a good question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.925" offset="6005600">Now, whatever may be so of Blumenthal or Humiston, we do have the adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.804" offset="6029214">As I read what the Court of Appeals did in this case of a sentence that in the circumstances even of a newsworthy item, the privilege to use ones name should not be granted even though a true account of the events is given, let alone when the account is senseless, sensationalized and fictionalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.453" offset="6119807">Now, if that's the law of New York, if that's the interpretation of the New York statute, which we have to take in deciding this case, number one, I have serious difficulty whether that interpretation can stand in the face of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.127" offset="6202458">And secondly, if it can't, whether under Dombrowski and Button and that line of cases, even though this is an intentionally false statement, as you have argued, Time doesn't have standing but as it does, to strike down the statute under the First Amendment, and that's my difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.164" offset="6290648">And whether that's to be resolved by either circuit or whether we ought to send it back to the Court of Appeals of New York and ask the Court of Appeals of New York whether actually, they meant this to be the interpretation of the statute, it's the kind of thing that I'm trying to worry through.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.462" offset="6399840">First, as far as the Raiben opinion is concerned, the Raiben opinion with regard to this case states this, “The difficulty with the position of the defendant, Time, is it portrayed the previous Hill incident in a highly sensational manner and represented that the play was a true version of that event.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.371" offset="6479461">It was not, it was fictionalized, the jury so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.911" offset="6497642">Consequently, it violated Section 51 of the Civil Rights Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.361" offset="6515405">And so as far as the Raiben opinion is concerned, and as far as the law of this case is concerned, that is what Raiben says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.830" offset="6545289">Now, he goes on to a dictum, a dictum which as we have agreed, has been adopted as the opinion of the courts of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.793" offset="6641107">The dictum says, in that -- if it can be clearly demonstrated that a newsworthy item is presented, not for the purpose of disseminating news but rather for the sole purpose of increasing circulation, then the rationale for exemption no longer exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.391" offset="6703487">And in such circumstances, the privilege to use ones name should not be granted even though it should counter the event be given, and that is what concerns Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
