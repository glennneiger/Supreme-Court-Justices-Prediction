          <heading>Argument of Gardiner Johnson</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="15.476">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Utah Construction &amp; Mining Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.220" offset="124217">Mr. Johnson.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gardiner_johnson" startTime="15.476" stopTime="423.401">
            <label>Mr. Gardiner Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="15.476" offset="165282">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.226" offset="192240">The contract which is the subject of this litigation was signed on March the 19th, 1953 between Utah Construction Company as it was then known and the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Idaho Operations Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.457" offset="305194">The amount of the original contract was $4,583,000 approximately.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.595" offset="345736">Because of many change orders involved, the eventual amount paid was substantially more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.244" offset="376351">The total amount of the claim which is involved in this litigation is approximately $1.5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.216" offset="420237">I would point out to the Court, for informational purposes only that the work involved was completed on January the 7th of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.975" offset="475303">The contract, a particular government contract, is the usual United States Standard Form Number 23 and as was developed in another case yesterday and at the time we thought over enthusiastically the particular article of the contract which is the center of this controversy is Article 15 generally known as the Standard Government Dispute Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.524" offset="625455">So that as far as the denomination of the contract is concerned and particularly the disputes clause, they are standard that there is nothing -- there is and there was nothing standard, nothing routine, nothing orthodox about the work that was involved without becoming involved in course and the craftsman employed by Utah Construction Company now Utah Construction &amp; Mining Company were out on the flat plains of Idaho attempting to construct this structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.380" offset="776861">And when in this litigation and in the claims, we talked about walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.318" offset="800684">We are not talking about the conventional walls of a building, we are talking about and speaking of interior walls of solid concrete, 5 feet in thickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.369" offset="844884">And the exterior walls were from 7 to 10 feet in thickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.479" offset="865259">When we speak of windows, one of the claims involves shield windows so-called.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.439" offset="889083">We are not speaking of traditional windows, we are speaking of specially designed blocks of glass 7 feet by 5 in dimensions, 5 feet thick, and one section of which weighed 3500 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.713" offset="962226">So that as I say, there was nothing orthodox or routine about the nature of the construction, and that of course is reflected in the complexity of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.845" offset="1014784">With respect to our petition, which is -- and our claim which is actually currently were subject to this litigation, I think it needs to be pointed out as it has not been done up to this moment that our petition as filed in the Court of Claims and which is set forth in the record of page 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.584" offset="1109661">Our petition sets forth as our legal effort one single cause of action for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.060" offset="1155636">In behalf of our client, the contractor we are seeking unliquidated damages for a breach of contract by the United States Government arising out of government caused delays.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.551" offset="1217599">But the point that I desire to emphasize because it's the very basis of the problem, is that we have filed in the Court of Claims pursuant to statutory authority, as we must, a cause of action for our breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.104" offset="1295757">The questions here involved them.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.978" offset="1303280">The claims are breached -- the claim is breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.496" offset="1321357">We file this under a statutory proceeding, a statutory authority, the so-called Tucker Act which provides that claims founded upon expressed or employed contract are enforceable against the United States Government because of the waiver of sovereign immunity which is contained in the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.211" offset="1420204">That's congressional statute vest in the United States Court of Claims exclusive jurisdiction to determine the claims against the Government arising out of contract except for those under $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.974" offset="1487287">I would assume so that the contractor involved who had the small claim, would not have to journey to Washington, Congress in its wisdom provided that he might try his claim in the local District Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.341" offset="1552697">About our claim, one more very important thing needs to be made clear at the very start.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.673" offset="1586030">This action is a direct and an independent act application to the United States Court of Claims pursuant to the statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.441" offset="1633155">We are not here seeking a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.184" offset="1656142">This is in no sense an appeal from an administrative body's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.556" offset="1681638">We applied directly and independently on our breach of contract theory and there is no review here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.204" offset="1724165">I emphasize this because we feel that much if not all of the Government's argument both in the briefs and as expressed yesterday is beside the point because they speak of our claim as if it is a matter of appeal or review which it is not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gardiner Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="442.002" offset="1871391">My answer to that Your Honor, I hope is direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.857" offset="1882781">If the claim were strictly within the contract and nothing more, I feel the Bianchi decision as expressed, well, I may not agree with that in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.941" offset="1935130">I would be compelled to say that I think that would be binding but that is not our situation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.113" offset="1955819">As I will point out, as I proceed, that every stage of the administrative proceeding from the very beginning when the contracting officer made this decision, when the government counsel filed their pleadings, when the appeals were rendered its decisions, they precluded us from introducing evidence which they said related to breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.262" offset="2052472">We endeavored at the hearing to put in such evidence because we were attempting at the time, as I think any contractor does, when you are before an appeals board, you are hoping to get a prompt and a fair settlement, and to get on with new work.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.908" offset="2119032">And so your basic effort is to get into the record to get before the Court every item, every dollar of claim that you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.419" offset="2153096">And we tried confessedly to make no apology for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.496" offset="2173367">We attempted to get everything that was even remotely borderline as being -- as you point out within the scope of the disputes clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.134" offset="2211924">But by formal documents filed by the attorneys for the Government, by rulings on evidence, during the hearings and by their decisions, we were foreclosed.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.367" offset="2284857">I think I can, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.611" offset="2293844">Very clearly the one that is known as the aggre -- concrete aggregates claim which we among ourselves refer to as the dirty aggregates claim that was -- as denominated by everyone who considered it, it was referred to by the government representatives as a breach of warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.356" offset="2376808">And therefore quite clearly we think that entire claim was without the normal scope of the disputes clause similarly on the one which is denominated as the Pier Drilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.335" offset="2436681">There were aspects of that, very substantial aspects of that which were ruled at all levels to be beyond the normal scope of the disputes clause and in the nature of breach of contract and that both of those are very substantial claims so that there can be no question in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.394" offset="2516929">We think there has not been at any level, administratively or otherwise, that our petition before the Court of Claims does not in fact involve true breach of contract and items which concededly are beyond the scope of the disputes clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.381" offset="2584848">And as I've indicated to the Court, this is no academic position that we take.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.434" offset="2629151">Yes, Your Honor and well -- and one other point which I think one of your questions yesterday developed that nowhere in the contract, Standard Form 23 in any of the sections, and I'm thinking now specifically of Article 9, the so-called delay damages clause, but nowhere in the contract is there any provision by which when you alleged that the Government has delayed you and thereby damaged you, nowhere is there any provision for a substitute compensatory relief item, either by what --</text>

            <text syncTime="715.638" offset="2965922">The fact that you get that -- that there's no mechanism under the contract for you to get any compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.664" offset="2985984">Your statement of the basis of it is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.108" offset="2999777">In the nomenclature of the decisions down through the years including those in this case, it has been expressed in terms of breach of contract.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="734.132" offset="3039901">And so you'd have to go somewhere else anyway to have the matter finally settled.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gardiner_johnson" startTime="738.163" stopTime="972.780">
            <label>Mr. Gardiner Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="738.163" offset="3055992">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.252" offset="3060381">But as was pointed out or raised by one of your questions yesterday, there are other reasons why you -- why a contractor has to proceed under certain clauses of the contract even though he feels that his claim may really be breach of contract and we did it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.496" offset="3129344">We obtained administrative -- a very variable relief in extensions of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.959" offset="3151182">We were able successfully to obtain administratively extensions of time which completely eliminated any liquidated damages which were about to be assessed against the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.611" offset="3193814">We also obtained enough extensions that the money which had been retained, the retained percentage under the contract was released and we got that.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.004" offset="3227355">What we could not get -- we were proceeding as if -- you have to under Article 9 to get the extensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.116" offset="3255881">But they would not give us any monetary damages because it simply is not provided and under the normal procedure which was existent then and still is you have to go to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.861" offset="3306768">Now that raises the very basic issue here and I'm going to depart what I think would be -- from what I think would be a normal presentation to raise immediately so that the Court might understand our future -- our following points in proper context.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.363" offset="3388792">We want to point out what we believe to be and I think I expressed the -- in this respect, the feeling of the government contract bar of the nation, a staggering proportions of the Government's proposal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.197" offset="3464129">It's expressed, I think at page 49 of their brief, they say in some of the administrative practice like the decisions of the Court of Claims does not preclude on application of the Bianchi decision to require administrative submission of factual disputes underlying claims against the Government for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.907" offset="3555035">And that was expressed yesterday by counsel for the Government when he said that the disputes clause, I think I am quoting almost verbatim as I noted it down, "The disputes clause makes the agency the trier of all of the facts that may arise."</text>
            <text syncTime="885.960" offset="3647195">The grotesqueness though if the position is that they stopped there, both the brief and the argument and the important thing of course would be on the practical application.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.157" offset="3695992">They stopped there.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.023" offset="3707486">They do not suggest that the agency or the Administrative Board has any jurisdiction to make determinations or to grant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.858" offset="3758791">In fact they concede and it was conceded in an answer to a question yesterday that you still -- we would still have to file in the Court of Claims our petition but then it stagnates and it would have -- it would happen under their theory to every petition, it then stops and you go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.193" offset="3848129">How?</text>
            <text syncTime="936.572" offset="3849697">I don't know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1862.716" offset="7554278">He received a full and complete hearing on every one of these claims and every one of which incidentally was a place before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.611" offset="7585834">And in each one, the Board of Appeals of a hearing examiner in one case said very clearly the jurisdiction of the Board is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.719" offset="7630242">That appears on the record, if Your Honor please with respect to every -- for -- the Pier Drilling claim on record page 80 or the window claim on record page 182, for the door claim on page 122.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.434" offset="7689070">The Board of Contract Appeals had no doubt that they had cleared jurisdiction with respect to the concrete aggregate claim where the contracting officer did submit a motion to dismiss on basis that it was outside the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.051" offset="7747584">That motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.064" offset="7755630">The only part of the motion that was granted was that the appeal was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.505" offset="7777364">The contract -- I did not say yesterday nor did the hearing examiner in that case say that this was a breach of warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.747" offset="7810382">What the contracting officer -- what the hearing examiner rather did say on page 74 of the record in the concrete aggregate claim was that if Utah is arguing that this is a breach of warranty, then it is beyond the jurisdiction of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.505" offset="7881435">Then he went on to say, and said suffice it to say however, Utah rests its case upon the change conditions clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.321" offset="7912678">And that was his holding and then that it was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.596" offset="7925739">Incidentally, this argument or this dispute, the question that arises in connection with the application of the disputes clause is in my opinion largely a matter of semantics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.782" offset="7978506">When we speak of breach of warranty, we're not invoking any magic language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.297" offset="7996583">Every change condition which is in the contract is in one sense a breach of warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.053" offset="8019571">Everytime a contractor asks for a change order because something additional has been asked of him, there's a reformation of the contract, whenever the Government decides either for its convenience or otherwise that the contract ought to be terminated, there's a rescission of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.259" offset="8084459">These words don't raise any magic legal theories that are outside the scope of the disputes clause or is not a proceeding or a situation which does not arise under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.142" offset="8131897">The contractor here didn't think that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.066" offset="8143600">He presented everyone of this so-called breach of contract claims to the Board and the Board considered each one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.419" offset="8177037">And in each case, they had detailed, full, complete hearings except in the one where it was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.919" offset="8203055">And even there, there was extensive argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.722" offset="8214235">And even there, facts were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.366" offset="8224789">And what are the facts that need to be found for this so-called breach of contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.951" offset="8243179">The causes of delay, the fact of delay, whether it's the Government's fault, whether it's the contractor's fault, are these causes beyond the control of the contractor, are they within the control of the Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.140" offset="8291976">These are the facts which underlie a so-called breach of contract for delays and those things are specifically committed by Article 9 of the contract which appears in our brief, on page -- bottom of page 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.690" offset="8378180">What do they find out?</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.179" offset="8384136">What is committed to this contracting officer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.848" offset="8398764">It says that the contractor, if he's met with any delay, shall within 10 days from the beginning of that delay notify the contracting officer who shall ask of the causes of the delay is what he notifies him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.054" offset="8451636">And the contracting officer shall ascertain the facts and the extent of the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.103" offset="8471803">Then of course, they say he will extend the time not imposed the liquidated damages that the contract might provide for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.569" offset="8505657">Now the only suggestion that has been made and I see no rational basis for it, is that unless another clause of the contract says, there's no question that all of these are breaches whether it's -- the only thing is, is that is there were clause in the contract which says that the contracting officer shall make an equitable adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.887" offset="8582875">Now, those are breaches that the Government has anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.687" offset="8598131">They have occurred with such frequency that they anticipate those breaches and they therefore provide that an equitable adjustment shall be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.576" offset="8633657">However, it's not this contract that authorizes the Government to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.885" offset="8650898">The Government has given the money and authorized to pay by the Appropriation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.124" offset="8671901">And yet this Court holds, as I believe it should, that every disputed question arising under this contract is one within the scope and the ages of this proceeding as I believe it is then the money will be paid out of the appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.388" offset="8744939">The only reason it's not now is because judicially, not by contract, it has been said that there -- the -- that it's not within their power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.449" offset="8781197">That's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.491" offset="8785377">They pay these kinds of claims all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.639" offset="8793945">They paid Utah for a type of breach of contract claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.729" offset="8810245">They paid them for general supervision, profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.128" offset="8823933">Those are the things that go into the delay claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.620" offset="8833860">On the concrete aggregate, they paid that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.101" offset="8843786">They paid every cent he asked for which included claims which were not excess cost.</text>
