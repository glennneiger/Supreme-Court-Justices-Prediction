            <text syncTime="24.099" offset="201812">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.348" offset="214768">This case started as two declaratory judgment actions in the District Court for the Western District of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.215" offset="250295">They were brought by Calmar and by Colgate-Palmolive Company against Cook Chemical.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.265" offset="282478">Cook Chemical Company was the assignee of U.S. patent number 2870943 which was originally issued to Baxter I. Scoggin Jr.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.589" offset="347784">The declaratory judgment suit was brought after Cook had threatened these parties with an action for a patent infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.407" offset="382997">And the declaratory judgment actions sought a declaration that the patent in question was invalid and a declaration that it was not infringed by the device that Calmar was making.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.850" offset="444855">Calmar was a maker of plastic spraying devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.821" offset="468679">Colgate-Palmolive was one of its costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.949" offset="477247">It purchased these devices and used them on insecticide bottles.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.655" offset="500025">The -- there was then a counterclaim by Cook as there frequently is in patent declaratory judgments suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.183" offset="534194">A counterclaim for infringement and that injunction and damages were sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.393" offset="558958">The District Court found that the patent was valid; found that it wasn't infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.123" offset="581945">Before passing on the question of damages under the Rule 54(b) the District Court certified that there was no reason for entering there -- that there is no reason for delay in entering a judgment on the issues of validity and infringement and under it such a judgment which was an appealable order.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.220" offset="658328">The Eighth Circuit on appeals by Calmar and Colgate affirmed the judgment of the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.811" offset="688630">There were then petitions for certiorari presented to this Court, urging the Court to grant the petitions and to find the Scoggin patent invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.635" offset="731993">And that was the question presented to the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.938" offset="749129">We have here a picture of the device that is disclosed in Mr. Scoggin's patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.451" offset="787268">This is on page 381 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.264" offset="806494">The device is essentially a sprayer of the sort that you buy in supermarkets that comes mounted in a bottle of insecticide were like.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.741" offset="860411">Here is the -- actually this is the -- yes this is the assignee of the patent, but this is a Cook Chemical's product sitting in this bottle here.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.924" offset="913074">What this consist of is a pump which goes down into the bottle -- the bottle would be down here.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.566" offset="1219647">Previously the merchandizing technique, if you will, had been to take the bottle of insecticide, have a plain cap on it, have a paper collar attached to that cap, and have a sprayer attached to that paper collar.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.227" offset="2442282">So he had to have the seal in the cap and actually there are two places where you could put the seal; you could put the seal below the threads or you can put the seal up here above the threads.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.849" offset="2504767">What Mr. Lohse did was to put the seal down here below the threads and as what we've just seen what Mr. Scoggin did was to put the seal up here above the threads.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.405" offset="2555026">I think if you're talking about places where you might put a seal in a bottle cap of the sort that that exhausts the two possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.133" offset="2597972">Now when Mr. Scoggin first put in his patent application to the Patent Office, he had about 15 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.764" offset="2632453">Now, the function under the patent statute of the claims is to define the invention as to which the inventor claims a monopoly punishments of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.632" offset="2687937">The first 15 claims that he put in were really broad enough to make -- to describe the Lohse device.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.992" offset="2729420">There were entirely broad terms and they've described the function of a pump with an over-cap with a seal in an arrangement -- neutral arrangement, either like this or like his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.589" offset="2795771">The Patent Office, to its credit, rejected that by citing the Lohse patent against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.880" offset="2828894">Then there were a few other actions back and forth with the patent examiner writing to Mr. Scoggin.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.112" offset="2857838">Mr. Scoggin taking up aggressively narrower and narrower claims until finally, the Patent Office issues him a patent when his claims have been narrowed down to describe the specific technique of his seal that is his placement of the seal up here, and the fact that he put a cap down there so that you could pack it.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.670" offset="2976120">So that you could screw the cap down and before you got to the container cap itself, this seal here would catch, so to speak and he put the -- put a cap in there so that that wouldn't happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.757" offset="3368479">Now, there -- as we say there are really only two places in which Scoggin put a -- could have put the seal in the bottle cap, below the threads or above the threads.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.506" offset="3431487">I don't know if any further demonstration is necessary to show that it was an obvious thing to put the seal above the threads but we have found a few patents which disclose the idea of putting a fluid seal up above screw threads.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.460" offset="3499301">The first one of these is a patent issued to Mr. Mellon in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.284" offset="3554576">Here we have an arrangement which is quite like Lohse and quite like the ultimate Scoggin patent except that what you have here is a cap that fits directly down on the bottle rather than on the underlying bottle cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.208" offset="3622285">In other words, in this arrangement you don't have the second bottle cap here but you have it in the Scoggin and the Lohse devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.843" offset="3672754">But we cite this to show the positioning, the prior art in positioning a seal in an arrangement of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.583" offset="3703787">Here, we have the seal put up here above the screw threads in a hold-down cap that holds down a pump which is exactly the same place and exactly the same technique that Mr. Scoggin's patent teaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.853" offset="3784871">Actually, as I mentioned before the common garden hose is now even Mellon drawing as at page 457 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.882" offset="3824995">The garden hose I believe uses the same technique with the washer inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.707" offset="3848296">You will have a coupling with a screw thread and up above the coupling that you would have a rubber washer.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.018" offset="3873479">So that when you plug the other element in, tighten them up the end of the one half of the garden hose would fasten and seal in your washer up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.493" offset="3927395">There are other examples besides the Mellon patent of the particular technique of positioning the seal where Mr. Scoggin positions his.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.373" offset="3974938">One rather interesting one is the patent, it's disclosed in the patent issued to a Mr. Livingston.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.902" offset="4013077">This was in 1955 and again a few years before Mr. Scoggin's patent was applied for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.193" offset="4050171">Mr. Livingston was dealing with hydrofluoric acid.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.235" offset="4074412">Apparently, he was either an employee or on retainer; he had some relationship with the company that had to deal with hydrofluoric acid which is highly toxic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.149" offset="4117985">Now, this was dealt within flasks or bottles that have to have pouring spouts on the top, this is a pouring spout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.578" offset="4155705">And the pouring spout can be, in this patent, can be put into the bottle itself, here's the bottle, through a -- an arrangement which -- which holds it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.327" offset="4226759">Now, what Livingston's idea was, was to again take an over-cap or hold-down cap and depressed the pouring spout of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.386" offset="4279003">And then effect a seal up here, in the very same place that Mr. Scoggin effected it, up above the screw threads that join the over-cap to the housing of the pouring spout here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.677" offset="4348176">Now, what this -- incidentally, what this was trying to achieve was as follows, The hydrofluoric acid would leak out of the pouring spout.There was no seal up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.527" offset="4399480">And if you didn't have this arrangement here, which allowed it to flow black into the bottle, the fellow who opened up the cap would get the hydrofluoric acid on his hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.589" offset="4443784">Now this permitted it to flow back down to the bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.625" offset="4455905">There was a seal up here which prevented it from getting out of the having the arrangement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.967" offset="4481296">This seal, I think, is in the same position and performs the same function like the seal in the Scoggin patent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.879" offset="5192976">Actually, what Calmar did in the SS-40 that was important in the SS-40 did come out after the Bakan 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.419" offset="5227144">Well, what Calmar did in the SS-40 was to provide internal seals, that is, it seals down in the bottom part of the pump and seals up inside here inside the pump and these seals prevent the fluid from getting into the bottle cap in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.936" offset="5313139">And actually, that in turn is important because besides containing the fluid inside the bottle cap is a further question in this area, it's the question, what happens to the housewife when she opens the cap and the fluid that's in the cap might come out under the Bakan 2 arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.794" offset="5396626">There is nothing that prevents it from getting up here into the cap under the Calmar arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.128" offset="5497981">Our contentions in this case are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.914" offset="5517103">Whichever way you phrase the standard, the Scoggin device is not an invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.694" offset="5548241">Put it in the terms of Section 103, the modification that Scoggin did of the prior art of the Lohse patent simply consisted of an obvious modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.520" offset="5603516">Taking a sealing technique that was taught in a number of prior art patents and in fact probably needed no teaching and simply using that is a modification of the Lohse device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.029" offset="5665583">The repositioning of the seal was obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.309" offset="5682615">It was not an invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.545" offset="5691601">We suggest to the Court that there are two principal fallacies that were committed by the Patent Office and by the lower courts here that have combined and created the -- we submit, the necessity of this Court's reviewing and reversing the judgment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.759" offset="5776447">The first, of course, is the fallacy of the Patent Office in granting countless patents while they can be counted there about 60 or 65,000 a year now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.139" offset="5822004">Most of which cover trivial modifications of prior art devices and a shocking number of which cover gadgets with the sort of this, that is involve in the suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.778" offset="5900581">But what happens is that these patents are licensed to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.663" offset="5924091">You can't bring a patent suit without a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.266" offset="5938510">Once these patents get into the courthouse there are these attempts to broaden them and to refer to the commercial history of what went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.345" offset="5978843">And that I think is the fallacy that the lower courts committed which compounded the error that the Patent Office committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.354" offset="6022834">The question is far as the lower courts were concerned and I have no quarrel with most of the language, they've cited all the right cases and they -- their quotations are accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.595" offset="6071839">But the -- again it's a case of the difference between the letter and the spirit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.509" offset="6095454">The basic question that the lower courts decided really was which manufacturer of plastic sprayers for insecticides in the late 1950s was the first to reach the market with the sprayer that could be shipped in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.243" offset="6162432">And Bakan Cook Chemical did come out of the whole bit before Calmar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.248" offset="6194406">The lower courts lost cite of what is the essential question whether in terms of the prior art, there was an invention, there was an advance that was not obvious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.818" offset="7372737">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.740" offset="7392381">I think if respondent's position were to be boiled down to a word, it would be that we consider this to be a key case not from the standpoint of this invention be in world shaking or that the world could not have got along without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.602" offset="7467823">That because in this case, it is now possible for the Court in our opinion to remove a substantial amount of confusion that has been going on for years in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.220" offset="7522262">This Court has the opportunity in this case to set some guidelines and some rules and some regulations that the lower court is looking for their needing help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.573" offset="7567715">They want help by a compassion for the problem that they have in determining whether or not an invention is obvious or whether it is not obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.259" offset="7618497">It is our position that the Eighth Circuit in this case took the right approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.851" offset="7644829">Certain Negro doctrines were set forth that this Court can adopt and can do so without having to change any laws or without having to dig up some new principle not heretofore heard of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.973" offset="7713270">What the Cir -- Eighth Circuit did in this case, was to first look at the statute, finding that statutorily, there are three conditions for patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.726" offset="7768336">It must be new, it must useful and then under 103, it must not be obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.928" offset="7809087">But the Fifth Circuit did not stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.888" offset="7824969">As soon as it applied the statute, it went into a determination of what this Court, the Supreme Court, had said in the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.331" offset="7870736">And it said that, “In order to be patentable, an invention must meet high standards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.743" offset="7912427">A mention was made earlier this morning of whether or not the last sentence of 103 is of any consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.493" offset="7963418">And the question was raised as to whether or not 103 changed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.338" offset="7986824">The Eighth Circuit went back from 35 years and I find the Eighth Circuit has been applying exactly what 103 has said for smaller than 35 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.319" offset="8042726">They cited a case of Pearce versus Mulford which we set forth in our brief at pages 31 and 42 and which the language, almost identical language of 103, is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.627" offset="8103957">Now, if there's any change in 103 over and above what has always been the law of this Court would perhaps be in the last sentence and we can only say that maybe the Supreme -- the Congress was intending to say, “We don't like to hear the Court say flash of genius.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.330" offset="8190788">Well, the irony of that is the only reason this Court ever use the word “flash of genius” was to make a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.159" offset="8218060">This Court has said over and over again the standard must be high.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.996" offset="8233420">They have used all kinds of language to make that point clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.375" offset="8250870">And one way to do it is to say there must be a “flash of genius”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.615" offset="8263931">So Congress early in the last sentence had in mind that there shall be no more “flash of genius”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.276" offset="8286501">But be that as it may, that is not our argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.576" offset="8311683">We go along with the concept that there must be a high standard of invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.822" offset="8336760">103 merely says that the condition for patentability that has not before been in the statutory law is that it shall not be obvious to one skilled in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.280" offset="8398514">Now, how was the law applied in the Eighth Circuit?</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.059" offset="8417635">In this case, first of all, the Eighth Circuit found that the Scoggin invention was new.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.442" offset="8447206">Now, it's not very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.873" offset="8456923">The law is clear, any eighth grade school boy could understand what you mean when say that a device must be new as distinguished from something that is old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.896" offset="8501018">Number two, the Eighth Circuit followed 102 in determining that there was novelty that -- and that there was utility, I'm -- I'm sorry 101 on utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.931" offset="8549188">And the way they found out was to determine if there was widespread use, that there had been a success, and there had been acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.037" offset="8581580">Certainly, if there were no utility, those conditions would not have existed and for that reason the Eighth Circuit said the device was useful.</text>

            <text syncTime="2153.773" offset="8720551">But before doing this so, I should like to first continue an attempt to clear up some of the confusion as to the law and how it was applied by the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.180" offset="8770184">The question was asked this morning whether or not the Eighth Circuit has ever interpreted 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.334" offset="8798710">I do not recall the answer but in my opinion, it has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.948" offset="8821175">In the Blue versus Dempster case which we cite, a 1960 case, at pages 41 and 42 of our brief the Eighth Circuit said, “In applying 35 U.S.C.A. 103, this Court follows the standards of patentability set out by the United States Supreme Court in the NP case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.121" offset="8913857">And that's as far as the Eighth Circuit has gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.688" offset="8932143">What they do -- what the Eighth Circuit has done and which we submit should be done by all of the circuits is to first consider the law, the statutory law, determine whether or not the invention is new, determine whether or not it has utility and then attempt to determine whether or not it was obvious to one skilled in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.708" offset="9020228">The problem and the difficulty, is determining whether or not it is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.826" offset="9044679">Each court is called upon to within -- but a few hours understand the principles of every art that might come before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.158" offset="9086056">Whether it'd be chemical, electrical, or something simple, he must understand it and determine for himself whether or not it is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.372" offset="9126912">I submit that this should not be the whim of the judge and how he happens to feel about the particular art that he is considering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.032" offset="9161498">Did I submit that there are ways to determine whether or not it is obvious?</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.806" offset="9192636">And these are the 18 points that I intend to discuss, the 18 guidelines, the 18 signposts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.092" offset="9229834">They are referred to many times as make ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.301" offset="9242582">Our adversary in this case refers to them as something irrelevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.116" offset="9265883">We say that it is abundantly rel -- relevant if it were not for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.604" offset="9287826">If we were not to look at these 18 points, these 18 guide posts, then all we have is the statute which says it shall not be in obvious and we have the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.585" offset="9335787">And the appellate court and this Court having it determined for themselves whether or not it is obvious simply by listening to one bit of evidence where experts will say, “Yes, it was obvious” and another says, “No it was not obvious.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.272" offset="9398481">And we get nowhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.138" offset="9457936">But I shall point this out that in all 18 points except one, this Court has passed on it and it said this is something to be looked at to be determined whether or not this invention should be held valid or invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.356" offset="9534840">One point I could not find any law and although I suspected that it has come up before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.638" offset="9576009">Again before going to those 18 points, I'd like to take up this question of fact or law again which seems to be a confusing thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.204" offset="9634210">At the Eighth Circuit level counsel, my opponent was asked the very the same question and I was asked the question, do we have facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.295" offset="9682589">Questions are, do we have law of questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.700" offset="9696172">Counsel said it's a question of mixed fact and law.I say that begs the issue, that doesn't tell us on anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.786" offset="9724594">Let's go back to grave -- to Goodyear Tire versus Ray-O-Vac where this Court in 1944 said that it must a strong case before this Court was set aside concurrent findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.976" offset="9801289">A little bit later in Graver versus Linde in 1950, this Court emphasized Rule 52 (a) to be sure there was a dissent in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.941" offset="9853221">But later on in the AMP case again the question came up as to whether or not the concurrent two court rules should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.229" offset="9902331">This Court was not -- it was not necessary for this Court in the AMP case to decide that one way or another because the Court said that there were no substantial dispute and findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.395" offset="9951023">And therefore, the AMP case stands for a principle of law which simply says that when you have a claim -- when you have a combination claim, that includes a new element and that is always new, you should claim that element and not claim it as a new combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.768" offset="10028450">We have no difficulty on combinations of old elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.182" offset="10046109">It's very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.327" offset="10050706">If you got a number of old elements in the combination, the only question is whether or not that combination is new.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.076" offset="10077769">The difficulty is when you find the invention to be only in one element and that element is new.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.699" offset="10108176">And the Court has said, “You must claim that, otherwise, you're overclaiming your invention.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.638" offset="10127924">That Patent Office says to us over and over again, “You have an old and exhausted combination that you're claiming if you think this is a new claimant.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.970" offset="10173273">In our case, we have a combination of old elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.253" offset="10186439">There isn't a single element in the combination that is new.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.808" offset="10200649">We have not claimed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.458" offset="10207232">We cannot be accused of overclaiming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.640" offset="10216009">We have claimed only the combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.170" offset="10222070">We said that combination is new and that it has never been done before and it has utility and it is not obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.451" offset="10251222">So we get down to what is the proper approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.349" offset="10266791">And we find that as a conclusion of law, the question of validity is to be determined by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.995" offset="10309423">But until we come to that final question of validity, there are a number of facts that must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.760" offset="10340456">Otherwise, we're deciding that in evacuant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.277" offset="10378491">Now, the 18 points, Number one, the record has established clearly that there was a need for this invention; that the need existed for a long, long, time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.258" offset="10450484">And one time, the liquid was dispensed with a hand sprayer, a tin hand sprayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.004" offset="10477443">Later on, the sprayer -- the plastic sprayer was hung on the side of the bottle through a cardboard holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.244" offset="10522373">What was needed was a shipper sprayer; a sprayer that could become and then it will go part of the package.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.284" offset="10546510">It would not leak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.076" offset="10549750">It would not break.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.917" offset="10553093">It would not become lost or pilfered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.732" offset="10564378">Calmar and its costumers knew of that need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.552" offset="10579634">Number two, we had a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.612" offset="10591859">The record establishes -- it establishes the fact that the -- that the problem was baffling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.556" offset="10623624">The petitioner say, “Supposedly there was a problem but their own witnesses have admitted over and over again that they -- that they could not solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.116" offset="10681929">The problem was that you can't simply place the square inside the container and let it go with that because it will leak and it will get broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.052" offset="10717665">Hanging it on the side was not the solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.048" offset="10729576">It had to do five things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.936" offset="10737204">It had to hold that sprayer depressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.086" offset="10745772">It had to house to protect the head against damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.406" offset="10759043">It had to prevent leakage to the outside and onto the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.269" offset="10774507">It had to remain sealed after it had been once sealed at the factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.712" offset="10792270">At the time the sprayer is made in this condition, they cover copy and sealed in place and then it can be subsequently placed in the container and the container cap -- the metal container cap can be sealed through automatic machinery without disturbing the seal between the cover cap and the collar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.677" offset="10880146">Those were the things that Mr. Scoggin had to solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.108" offset="10893834">Those -- those were the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.226" offset="10910344">Point number three relates to the skill and the experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.197" offset="10930197">This Court has said many times that if no one has been trying to solve this problem, if this is what we call a “wouldn't it be nice invention”, and we have many of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.617" offset="10979934">People come in daily and say, “Wouldn't it be nice if have this one?</text>

            <text syncTime="3817.884" offset="15376969">And there the witness who was associated with the company that practiced the Lohse patent clearly testified that it inhibited the leakage, that it was capable of an automatic assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.677" offset="15432140">In other words, if you could put the over-cap and the sprayer and the container cap together and then put them into a bottle which was exactly what Mr. Scoggin did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.274" offset="15470488">Now, Mr. Scoggin's testimony was that when he tried the Lohse technique, there was leakage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.099" offset="15501834">Now, perhaps Mr. Scoggin had some sort of problem that his device helped him to solve but the fact of the matter is that the Lohse according to the undisputed testimony of what happened back in the late 30s was an effective commercial device.</text>
