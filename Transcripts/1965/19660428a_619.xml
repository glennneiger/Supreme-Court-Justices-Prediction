            <text syncTime="13.068" offset="155669">Steve Ashton was convicted of criminal libel in Kentucky in 1963, November 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.311" offset="196629">It was a common law crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.806" offset="214601">The appeal, the original conviction which was in the Circuit Court Hazard, he appealed it to the highest court of the state, the Kentucky Court of Appeals and that court affirmed the conviction with three of the southern judges dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.334" offset="296730">The sentence which was imposed by the jury was six months in jail and a fine of $3000.</text>

            <text syncTime="67.426" offset="373112">He had come to Hazard, Kentucky as a result of hearing some television scenes and television programs in which the plight of some striking miners were shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.671" offset="434030">Hazard, Kentucky and Perry County was the center of a mining area where there had been a prolonged labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.252" offset="488364">Some of the miners in that area were on strike and some were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.071" offset="519607">Now, Ashton who'd come down as the representative of a student committee, he was bringing food and clothing down for the strikingminers.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.540" offset="565582">And while there, he wrote a report on what was happening, and it was to be sent I believe mostly to his friends and colleagues and perhaps to some others who would be willing to help the miners.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ephraim London</label>
            <text syncTime="199.424" offset="901099">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.131" offset="907891">We shall raise the question of whether that was in fact a publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.602" offset="921788">I like to come to that a little bit later if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.892" offset="934954">But there were three people supposedly libeled in this report.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.010" offset="959404">One was Sam Luttrell, Police Chief of Hazard, another was Charles Combs, the High Sheriff of Perry County, and the third was Mrs. Nolan, the co-publisher of the local newspaper, the Hazard Herald.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.908" offset="1027009">Now, the things that were written about the High Sheriff and the Police Chief were certainly unflattering.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.088" offset="1067760">But for the most part, they were completely true.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.520" offset="1081448">Now, for example Ashton wrote that the Sheriff had been indicted for manslaughter while he was still acting as sheriff and that was perfectly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.557" offset="1121573">And he said that the Sheriff although he was supposed to be impartial in this dispute between the striking and non-striking miners, was actually the owner and operator of the mine and that was perfectly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.550" offset="1185520">And he wrote that the Sheriff had beaten up a boy in the Sheriff's jail so badly that the boy lost the sight of one eye and that the boy was tear-gassed while in jail, that the Sheriff had to pay a judgment to the boy of $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.847" offset="1250722">Now, it was true that the boy was beaten up.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.629" offset="1261902">It was true that he had lost the sight of one eye and it was true he recovered a judgment against the Sheriff of $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.601" offset="1285726">But it appears the Sheriff wasn't there at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.906" offset="1298996">And that the beating was probably administered by some subordinates of the Sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.843" offset="1330761">Ashton said that the Sheriff probably bought off the jury that rendered the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.997" offset="1355316">That was not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.474" offset="1361272">And at least it wasn't true that he bought off the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.560" offset="1369631">The word probably was put in but certainly the inference of that statement was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.851" offset="1398784">Now, the statements he made about the Police Chief were also unpleasant and also for the most part true.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.634" offset="1433893">He said that the Police Chief had a policeman in his staff who sympathized with the striking miners and that man had had his life threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.975" offset="1463254">Well, not only was that true but the one who passed on the threat was the Police Chief himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.073" offset="1511633">He said that -- Ashton said that the Police Chief was holding down a private job as a guard and that that was against the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.404" offset="1549040">But that was untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.612" offset="1557817">The Police Chief wasn't holding down an outside job.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.094" offset="1575790">He certainly wasn't violating the law in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.806" offset="1594598">Now, the statements made about Mrs. Nolan didn't impute my thinking any serious wrong and in any event I believe they were true but I'd like to speak of them later if there is sufficient time.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.112" offset="1651858">Ashton was tried twice, first jury disagreed and the second jury by a 12 -- by a 10 to 2 verdict, found him guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.437" offset="1689161">And as I said before it was the jury that imposed the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.702" offset="1802219">It was a general verdict to guilty by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.860" offset="1814862">And there was no indication of whether they find him guilty of libeling the Sheriff or the Police Chief or Mrs. Nolan.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.037" offset="1839522">That wasn't separately stated or made clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.599" offset="1861778">And point of fact there had been in the -- named in the indictment a Mr. Nolan who was the other owner of the Hazard Herald and the indictment as against him was dismissed for lack of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.375" offset="1912874">Now, the criminal law -- criminal libel law of Kentucky as it's construed in this case by Kentucky's highest court, we submit is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.478" offset="1965328">Now, the entire law we state, not as it's applied in this case but the law itself is we think clearly unconstitutional because it makes writing a crime when that writing concededly doesn't create any serious danger to the community and indeed even to the individuals who maybe libeled.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.163" offset="2075982">It punishes as a crime, speech that doesn't in anyway affect the public or the community or the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.454" offset="2109210">Now, according to the opinion of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, any private per se libeled which is made with knowledge of the fact that the statements are untrue is a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.595" offset="2173785">In Kentucky any per se libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.975" offset="2191235">And it is conceded by the Attorney General that the criminal law is designed primarily to redress purely private injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.136" offset="2243897">If I can read from the Attorney General's brief, just a moment at page 16, he states that it's admitted that some defamatory publications at it's lowest which could be punished as a crime would not be serious in impact as others.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.973" offset="2351313">And then he goes on to say, “It is admitted that the Kentucky common law offense is designed to protect individual reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.951" offset="2415156">And a similar statement is made on page 3 of his brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.027" offset="4659493">And the only way we can deter him is by this threat of criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.466" offset="4681226">Now, I think making it a crime where a man is penniless and a civil wrong where the man has funds doesn't exactly square with our notions of equal justice to the indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.323" offset="4748622">By the way, a similar statement to the one that I just referred is made again at the brief in the introduction where the Attorney General writes -- although the prevention of peace -- of the -- or breach of the peace is no longer a basis for criminality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.212" offset="4852172">Private libel should be subject to penal sanctions under the Kentucky common law in order to deter the commission of harm disturbing the community sense of security such as malicious character assassination by publication of calculated falsehoods by impecunious persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1225.884" offset="5006921">But the law is designed and the Attorney General has indicated in order to protect the community against this penniless fellow who goes around insulting people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.019" offset="5043493">After all, the judgment against him isn't much good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.071" offset="5063659">And that's why it covers purely private personal abuse and speaking of the rationale of the law and as the Attorney General's concept, its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.374" offset="5124890">I think there's another answer to the question of when this criminal penalty will be invoked and when they will leave the individual who was libeled to his private remedy of action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.934" offset="5187062">I think the answer is suggested by this case because criminal libel is a rare prosecution in Kentucky as elsewhere in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.919" offset="5247039">But I think that where the person attacked is a government officer with the power to initiate the criminal prosecution, you are very likely to have the law used to punish the personal upfront to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.118" offset="5315793">I think most of the cases that have come to this Court have been cases where an officer of the law who had the power to initiate criminal prosecution, the one who did it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.397" offset="5777011">I think that there's a reference to a Browning case in which they had -- I think it was Browning where there had been the libeling of a public official that or least one of the early cases, there was a libeling of a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.143" offset="5843989">And the Court as I said in its opinion has indicated that the rule of the Sullivan case now applies in Kentucky namely that malice has to be shown, that's another question that I'd like to get to in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.373" offset="5908877">But returning to the question of publication, what happened here is that while Ashton was still gathering the material together and stapling it in a private room next to a tavern, the policeman who was making a routine check of the tavern came in and he saw some -- these pamphlets on the table and asked whether he could see one and Ashton said, “Certainly.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.420" offset="6009083">And as the policeman reached for one Ashton put his hand under the table and handed him a different topic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.581" offset="6049729">The policeman brought this back to the police station and showed it to the Police Chief and another policeman was dispatched to pick up a copy of the pamphlet the following morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.581" offset="6109706">The following morning, the second policeman came and he asked for a copy and received one in exactly the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.437" offset="6145128">I believe that the first policeman was accompanied by another so that possibly three policemen have received copies of the pamphlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.336" offset="6172714">Now, this is the only distribution, the only proof of distribution of this pamphlet that we have in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.673" offset="6202075">The Attorney General says that it -- and it indicates the copies would have been delivered to anybody who asked for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.976" offset="6235303">And that maybe true, that maybe a permissible inference to draw or it seems to me that when a policeman asks for something he's not to be denied as the public ordinary citizen is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.491" offset="6289324">But in any event, this is the total distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.129" offset="6307924">Now, I believe to extend the doctrine of the -- the implicit doctrine of the Garrison against Louisiana case in which it said that there must be some harm to the community, some threat upon to the community or to it's feeling of security that where you have so special, so private, so limited a distribution, the community is not affected, certainly not by the distribution by the accused himself, by Ashton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.987" offset="6435297">I think we must carry that constitutional doctrine to saying not only must the making of the statement, that is the writing of the statement be with knowledge of falsity or being malicious but that the publication must be also and that the publication must be in such ways to affect the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.728" offset="6534248">And it seems to me the delivery under these circumstances, under compulsion, ritual compulsion although there had been no order to deliver but merely request --</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.773" offset="6762454">So that if there was any distribution after that time, it was done by the police itself certainly not the voluntary act of Ashton that there was any distribution prior to that time, we don't know of it and certainly there was no proof in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.972" offset="6999228">And although it may not be necessary, the libels related to the performance of their duties unto their work as officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.918" offset="7043009">There was no extrinsic evidence at all that Ashton knew that the material was false.</text>

            <text syncTime="1983.569" offset="8037648">He came of course for a most commendable purpose to bring food and clothing to those who were in need.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.071" offset="8083623">But while he was there, he determined to cast his luck entirely with the striking miners who were not authorized in their strike by the United Mine Workers and they were operating a wildcat strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.478" offset="8137331">And he cast his luck with them and decided to write a pamphlet which favored their side of the controversy and maligned and defamed the officials who were in charge of enforcing the law in that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.189" offset="8204100">Had he merely presented the truth in his pamphlet, it would have been of value from a social standpoint and would've been fully -- certainly within the protection of the guarantee in the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.998" offset="8343385">He charged the Chief of Police of this city that he himself had violated the law by taking a private job on the side.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.465" offset="8533243">He was not fined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.008" offset="8539408">He did not intentionally beat this boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.347" offset="8548812">Now, it is said that there was substantial proof to this because in fact the Sheriff had subsequently been held liable in damages in a civil action for an instant regarding this boy that took place in his jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.114" offset="8599803">This is a far cry from the statement that the Sheriff personally intentionally beat this helpless boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.789" offset="8622477">One maybe held liable under bonds for the acts of his deputies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.229" offset="8640240">But to say that it's a different proposition and to say that the principle himself personally and intentionally committed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.662" offset="8673991">He said to the Sheriff that he had bought off the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.008" offset="8683395">This was not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.001" offset="8687365">He said that the Sheriff -- that he was fighting the pickets and the Sheriff denied this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.730" offset="8710248">These statements concerning the two public officials charged them as being felons and violators of the law and unworthy and degraded persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.928" offset="8747133">The statements about the newspaper, co-owner and publisher of the Hazard Herald imputed to her breach of a public trust and that she was suppose to have received from the public as a result of a television show, contributions to be devoted solely to the benefit of these pickets involved in the wildcat strike in the coal field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.603" offset="8825814">As a matter of fact there were two television programs, and the first one on which this fund was developed and on which it began was concerned with a Miller family who were farmers and the general theory of the program was “Help the Needy People.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.617" offset="8881821">The contributions coming in were not earmarked for the exclusive benefit of the pickets but were to be used for the needy persons and they were so used under the directions of the Government -- of the Governor of the State of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.745" offset="8934379">All of these funds and clothing which he received were distributed to needy persons throughout the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.254" offset="8960397">It was said of Mrs. Nolan that she was vehemently against labor in this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.073" offset="8979623">She not only denied this but stated that her own father had been an underground miner in the coal fields that her uncle had been killed working in the coal field that she was sympathetic with labor that her own husband was a member of the Typographical Typesetters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.381" offset="9040854">She stated that her newspaper had tried to promote peace and harmony in this community in this bitter struggle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.272" offset="9068440">She stated that she had tried to play down violence and tried to remove the threat of violence in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.937" offset="9099160">These statements about Mrs. Nolan were so -- shown to be substantially false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.213" offset="9116191">It was stated that none of the food and clothing went to the pickets when Mrs. Nolan stated that out of 14 truckloads of food and clothing, two truckloads at the outset went to the pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.341" offset="9156733">Now, these matters concerned the reputation of these persons and if we take the position that reputation of individuals is no longer of any importance then certainly this conviction cannot stand but I submit that it is a vital thing to all of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.333" offset="9216711">The crimes of extortion and blackmail frequently depend on a person's concern for his own reputation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.494" offset="13457324">In other words, the jury had to find the regular elements of this offense as they had been defined as far back as 1895 in our decisions and then they were required by this third separate instruction to find that in this particular case the impact of the defamatory words were such as to create a breach of peace.</text>
