            <text syncTime="62.813" offset="355641">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.545" offset="366613">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which affirmed petitioner's convictions for mailing three publications held to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.576" offset="430665">Petitioner Ginzburg was sentenced to five years imprisonment and fined a total of $28,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.207" offset="465251">The major issue in this case is whether these publications are obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.248" offset="493359">We and the Government agree that in order for a work to be obscene it must be without redeeming social importance, it must make its predominant appeal to prurient interest, and it must be patently offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.957" offset="564203">We say that none of the elements that identify obscenity are present in any of the publications in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="126.035" offset="608507">Your view that all of those elements have to coincide to constitute obscenity or that if any one of the elements exist?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sydney_dickstein" startTime="135.060" stopTime="653.528">
            <label>Mr. Sydney Dickstein</label>
            <text syncTime="135.060" offset="644660">No Your Honor, it's our view that all of these elements must coalesce in a single work in order for it to be proscribable obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.014" offset="676425">As to the element of redeeming social importance, the court below, the trial court found as did the Courts of Appeal -- Court of Appeals that none of these publications had the slightest social value, had any redeeming social importance, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.858" offset="751867">Here in this Court, the Government does not defend those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.944" offset="772138">It admits doubt as to whether EROS is without redeeming social importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.298" offset="797633">It concedes that the major portion of liaison that is the 2.5 page report of the interview with the well-known psychologist, Dr. Albert Ellis constitutes serious and protected advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.855" offset="867850">And so rather than ask this Court to conclude that these works are without redeeming social importance when considered as a whole, the Government asked the Court to dissect these two publications, article by article and consider each article as if it might be an independent obscene work.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.023" offset="976520">In this case, the door was closed to that approach before the trial even begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.777" offset="1003478">Petitioners asked for a bill of particulars in which the Government would be requested to state whether the indictment charge that the alleged nonmailable material was obscene when considered as a whole, or if it not whether part or parts of them were alleged to be obscene and if so, to state which parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.582" offset="1098773">Now, in lieu of the bill of particulars, the Government stipulated that the indictment charges that each of the alleged nonmailable material is obscene when considered as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.710" offset="1159272">And when we consider EROS and Liaison as a whole, we think it clear that they do have redeeming social importance and so as to those publications, this element is simply not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.206" offset="1217264">With respect to the third work, the Housewife's Handbook on selective promiscuity, here too the Government says that the lack of redeeming importance in this work maybe open to question and that the entire issue of its obscenity is a matter of legitimate debate, that's the position they assert here.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.360" offset="1301797">The claims for redeeming social importance of the Handbook were three.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.058" offset="1324680">First, as a true author biographical account of a woman sexually experienced as in attitudes, it provided needed information.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.939" offset="1372118">Secondly, it had been found useful or reading of the work had been found useful to some people particularly women whose normal sexual drives beset them with feelings of guilt and anxiety.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.959" offset="1432200">Here, was another woman talking to them and saying, ?This is the way I feel.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.632" offset="1450904">You are not alone in this world.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.566" offset="1458636">You need not live solely within the confines of your own mind.?</text>
            <text syncTime="343.568" offset="1478698">Third, the Handbook has much social commentary and advocate, seriously advocates the reshaping of society's view of the sexual role of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.328" offset="1541705">The Government says that the Handbook may have the values claimed for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.703" offset="1567201">If it has such values, we recognize that it comes within the protection of the First Amendment, so says the Government, but they had a restriction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.396" offset="1614012">They say so long as the distribution of the book reflects these social values which are claimed for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.068" offset="1652673">Now, this restriction, this appendage to redeeming social importance that the Government adds at this particular point of the litigation, when one thinks about it, I think it's really quite frightening.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.856" offset="1703769">What the Government is saying is that we can take a work with redeeming social importance and that Government may determine by occupational and educational qualification who maybe permitted to read this work and who may not be permitted to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.319" offset="1785689">If there were such a statute and it contained the authority for such of a classification, we think at the very least, it would raise grave constitutional doubts.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.691" offset="1823201">But this statute is not such a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.315" offset="1841695">It looks entirely to the material mail and it focuses neither on the motives of the mailer nor on the academic credentials of the addressee.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.994" offset="1888402">There are some other problems with the Government's suggestion, one of them shows what The Eleventh Hour suggestion it happens to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.049" offset="1916615">This record is absolutely silent as to the distribution that petitioner gave by Handbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.123" offset="1940856">All it shows is that 5000 copies of the book were mailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.936" offset="1964157">But it really doesn't matter because the values claimed for the Handbook were not solely for the clinician or the educator or the professional, those people whom the Government would say are permitted to read this work, therefore other people will be sized.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.837" offset="2039704">And as far as the Handbook Social Advocacy is concerned, it isn't even directed to those classes of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.148" offset="2068961">It's directed to the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.916" offset="2092053">And so this suggestion by the Government, the suggestion for an additional restriction on redeeming social importance is without support on this record is inapplicable to the values claimed for the Handbook, has nothing to do with this statute and is most probably unconstitutional as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.518" offset="2186512">The Government does agree, leaving that question aside, that if a work has redeeming social importance it is protected by the First Amendment regardless of whether the other elements which identify obscenity maybe present in that work.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.237" offset="2265297">The Government does add that a claim for redeeming social importance -- that redeeming social importance will not be established on the basis of a single well-termed phrase or one or two photographs of artistic merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.306" offset="2321617">But we agree with the Government on that but that's got nothing to do with this case and the Government doesn't claim that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.354" offset="2349829">What does have much to do with this case is the Government's agreement that once you find redeeming social importance, that is the end of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.696" offset="2399148">The amicus -- Citizens for Decent Literature feels differently about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.633" offset="2418897">I'd like to refer to their brief for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.755" offset="2431436">They urge this Court to adopt a balancing test under which -- works' affirmative values would be measured against its patent defensiveness or prurient appeal and that from this balance in someway we would strike a judgment as to whether or not the works were obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.165" offset="2517013">This test that the civil -- Citizens for Decent Literature urges the Court to adopt, flies in the face of this Court's holding in Roth where it was held that the -- obscenity statutes cannot be used to suppress that which has redeeming social importance and consider the practical consequences of this for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.875" offset="2603948">A publisher given a manuscript dealing with sexual matters would have to examine that manuscript, would have to ascertain how much if it constitutes the advocacy of an idea, would then have to waive the relative merit of that idea and having done so would then have to look and see, "Well, how much prurient interest is there and how much patent offensiveness is there in this work?"</text>
            <text syncTime="649.393" offset="2701960">And he would have to make a self-employed balancing test.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sydney Dickstein</label>
            <text syncTime="656.489" offset="2730381">No Your Honor, I don't think that is the job that this Court is confronted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.790" offset="2747517">I think if the Court finds that the work makes a serious claim to redeeming social importance, that work is protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.448" offset="2782208">And that's -- really is the end of the inquiry and so the Government agrees with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.787" offset="2803524">But if the publisher is required to make these judgments to weigh the affirmative values against everything else and match that judgment against that of every prosecutor in the United States, this would not only have a chilling effect upon the exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.395" offset="2881996">I think it would put all such publications in a deep freeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.827" offset="2907700">It would also create an insurmountable vagueness problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.398" offset="2929957">Hairline precision is not possible in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.156" offset="2941032">This Court has said so time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.030" offset="2952526">Everybody recognizes that there were difficulties inherent in applying these statutes with hairline precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.999" offset="2984396">These difficulties normally arise in the prurient interest and patent offensiveness in these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.047" offset="3008533">But we certainly don't need to make the test any less precise or any more subjective and this is precisely what the CDL was urging the course -- the Court to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.044" offset="3076556">Now, the Government agrees that this Court must exercise an independent judgment as to matters of redeeming social importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.702" offset="3115217">No question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.974" offset="3124308">This Court will make its own judgment on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.891" offset="3136010">But as to prurient interest appeal and patent offensiveness, it urges the Court to rely upon the findings of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.364" offset="3181881">This Court of course does not ordinarily need questions of constitutional classification of the First Amendment area to the judgments of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.674" offset="3223050">And even if it were inclined to rely on these findings, these findings don't even support the judgments of conviction as to EROS and Liaison where one of the elements of obscenity is missing as to each of these publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.398" offset="3290028">These findings, in addition, can have no deference paid to them because of the manner in which they were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.700" offset="3323152">These are purportedly findings made pursuant to Rule 23 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.170" offset="3357111">That rule provides that in a case tried without a jury, the Court shall make a general finding and shall in addition on request find the facts especially.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.988" offset="3412386">The trial court has given no discretion to deny the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.514" offset="3426492">If it's made, these findings must be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.059" offset="3444673">The request was made in this case the day before the trial concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.376" offset="3465885">The following day, the judge -- trial judge pronounced petitioner is guilty as to all counts of the indictment and directed the prosecutor to prepare the findings in support of that judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.487" offset="3534326">Sometime thereafter, we don't know when, the prosecutor having prepared proposed findings submitted them to the trial judge in the form of an ex parte off the record communication.And 54 days after they adjudged petitioners guilty, the trial judge handed down these so-called special findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.791" offset="3635576">Even if these were an ordinary criminal case rather than a case involving the exercise of First Amendment rights requiring scrupulous adherence to procedures, the manner in which the findings were made here we think would compel reversal of the judgment as an independent consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.386" offset="3725960">But aside from that certainly no deference can be made to these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.064" offset="3744664">And this Court must also exercise an independent judgment on the questions of prurient interest and patent offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.009" offset="3780399">Just a word on this, petitioners believed and tried their case on the premise that these are also concepts which lend themselves to objective evidence and they offered objective evidence as to both of these elements relating to the three publications at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.725" offset="3875276">This was not just opinion evidence as the Government would have you believe, there was much of it which was not opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.230" offset="3901294">But even as to the opinion evidence, it was evidenced by qualified experts, experts in the mental processes, experts in what people are reading, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.439" offset="3950195">The publications themselves and the evidence clearly established that there's no patent offensiveness and these works do not have prurient interest appeal and we are confident that this Court will reach that conclusion when these works are examined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1197.566" offset="4894678">In light of the full examination which the Court gave to that question in Roth, in light of the fact that in two cases since Roth, opinions in the Court had adhered to the Roth holding, the Jacobellis case and Manual Enterprises without questioning it, in light of the fact that petitioners themselves don't challenge the holding of Roth here, I don't think we should spend too much time on it in the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.415" offset="7310064">Principally, the point of difference on the application of the Roth standard seems to be in the way in which you apply the test to works like EROS and Liaison which are anthologies rather than integrated works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.604" offset="7370773">The Handbook is a single integrated work and I don't think we have any dispute over how you apply the standards there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.043" offset="7400552">But our view is that when you get a collection of independent works like EROS and likely this issue of Liaison, the work is obscene if any of the substantial parts of it are obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.682" offset="7459171">We don't believe that you privilege a work by putting some non-obscene material in with other obscene material if the material is not a whole, if it's just a bunch of independent pieces strung together in an anthology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.909" offset="7519984">You can't, for example in our view, sandwich concededly pornographic obscene photographs with other innocuous photographs and binding them together in a book and thereby privilege the entire thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.608" offset="7570871">We believe that this approach is wholly consistent with our stipulation in the trial court that you were to view these works as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.867" offset="7603890">We did not mean by that stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.888" offset="7611935">I don't think it's reasonable to attribute to that stipulation, the meaning that every part of these works had to be obscene, that is clearly an impossible standard for us to meet and we never attempted to set that burden for ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.003" offset="7668360">It means that you can't take works out of context but when you got the series of independent works, we see no reason why you can't, as the trial judge, explicitly did with regard to EROS taken in that case, four of them, which clearly constitutes a substantial part of the work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.314" offset="8597692">And first of all I'd like to talk about the scope of review in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.198" offset="8621202">We recognized that in the past since the Roth case and in the Roth case itself, individual opinions in this Court have suggested that the Court will formulate in these cases an independent constitutional judgment regarding the obscenity of particular materials involved at least in federal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.745" offset="8695390">And that's exactly what the Court of Appeals did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.643" offset="8710959">In light of the constitutional nature of the judgment involved as to whether a work is obscene or not and the intimate relationship with the First Amendment, we would not think it inappropriate if the Court wishes to exercise that complete de novo independent review of the materials in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.254" offset="8781385">We would however like to suggest an alternative to complete independent review of all the questions regarding whether a work is obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.120" offset="8824853">It seems to us that as to any work which the Court believes has reasonably been characterized by the trier of fact as obscene, meeting the three standards separately stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.074" offset="8884726">The Court might properly limit its independent examination to the question whether the work carries redeeming social importance that is if their judgment that the work appeals to prurient interest is reasonable that the judgment that it's patently offensive seems reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.102" offset="8948778">And to that of course, you have to look at the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.277" offset="8961526">But if you look at the materials and decided the judgments below seemed reasonably based, then we suggest that the Court might limit its independent -- completely independent judgment to the question of whether there's redeeming importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.059" offset="9012621">There are two reasons for this, two reasons we think support this approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.549" offset="9026623">First of all, in terms of vindicated, the affirmative protections of the First Amendment, the principle reason for this Court's review, it's the redeeming social importance which is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.655" offset="9078972">If the work has redeeming social importance, the First Amendment affirmatively means to permit its dissemination and that we think, it's entirely appropriate for the Court to safeguard by its independent review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.651" offset="9127037">But if the Court finds no redeeming social importance, then those affirmative values of the First Amendment don't seem to be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.989" offset="9156399">And if it's clear that the material is within the area of obscenity, it's reasonably been determined to be obscene, the fact that particular justices on the Court may disagree with the precise where -- place in which you draw the line seems to us not really to come into collision with the affirmative values of the First Amendment.</text>
