          <turn speaker="laurence_b_dodds" startTime="11.571" stopTime="698.654">
            <label>Mr. Laurence B. Dodds</label>
            <text syncTime="11.571" offset="149608">Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.228" offset="168312">Fortunately, the factual situation presented by this case is somewhat less complex than the one heard at the conclusion of the session yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.355" offset="204779">It can be very simply stated and this factual situation raises a single issue of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.928" offset="231111">As to the facts an inventor by the name of Robert Regis made an invention on a microwave switch and filed an application in the Patent Office in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.686" offset="282102">Briefly, microwave switch is a device which is useful in connecting and disconnecting a microwave transmitter station from it's antenna as principally used for example in radar installations.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.351" offset="340825">However, fortunately since the subject matter is quite complex, the issues involved do not require going into the details of that device.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.133" offset="387950">Now, after that application was filed in 1957 and certain preliminary proceedings in the Patent Office which are not material here, in 1959 the examiner of the Patent Office finally rejected the claims of Regis saying and “as being unpatentable over Wallace in view of Carlson” and that is the Wallace patent 2822526 and Carlson patent 2491644 reproduced in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.450" offset="537161">Those -- that decision of the primary examiner was affirmed by the Patent Office Board of Appeals and by the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.412" offset="576972">Now, the respondent neither in the Patent Office nor in the courts below contended that either of these two reference patents, the Wallace patent or the Carlson patent individually was in anticipation of the Regis invention, but what it contended was that if one were to combine the invention of Wallace with the invention of Carlson then as imagine -- as an engineering matter that combination would have been obvious and would have resulted in the structure defined by the claims in Regis application.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.667" offset="737991">That would be alright but for this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.601" offset="749798">At the time that Regis filed it's patent application in 1957, the Wallace disclosure was found solely in an application which was maintained in secrecy in the Patent Office and was not available to Regis nor to any other workers in the art who at that time might have been attempting to devise the Regis microwave switch.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.092" offset="859721">The Wallace application and the resulting patent is what has been come to be known in the jargon of the Patent Law as a co-pending patent, that is a patent which was filed before the patent on controversy but did not issue until later.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.427" offset="933073">So that there was a period in which both the so called reference patent and the application or patent under consideration were both pending in the Patent Office and both maintain in secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.096" offset="991796">Now, the respondent in this case relies solely on Section 103 of Title XXXV United Stated Code, the 1952 Patent Act and they will have a little more to say about that later, and the respondent contends that notwithstanding the fact that the Wallace patent was at the time a secret application in the Patent Office that it was and a “prior art” as that term is used in Section 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.605" offset="1121782">And therefore, the invention or the disclosure of Wallace could be combined with, taken together with that in earlier patents which were admittedly prior art to show that what Regis did was an obvious thing to do under Section 103 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.099" offset="1203806">Now as is petitioner's position however, that as a matter of law the Wallace patent, as of it's filing date, was not a part of the prior art as that term is used in Section103 of the statute and was not competent evidence to show whether or not what Regis did would have been obvious to that mythical man skilled in the art at the time that Regis made his invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.900" offset="1327000">Therefore, the sole issue of law presented on this petition is whether such a co-pending patent which is maintained in secrecy in the Patent Office until it issues is a part of that general fund of knowledge come to be known as the prior art as that term is used in Section 103 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.969" offset="1419264">Now, this Section 103 is the only section of the patent statutes which define for the term and conditions for patentability which uses this term prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.595" offset="1473703">And it reads in part, “If the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made, at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.”</text>
            <text syncTime="364.025" offset="1559489">Now, at the time the invention made as far as we're discussing here was at the time that Regis filed his patent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.482" offset="1585298">It had not been -- there has been no occasion for attempting to establish an earlier date of invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.684" offset="1614137">Now, the statutes nowhere explicitly define this term prior art, but there were many decisions of the courts, the lower and the superior courts going back a 100 years which did define the term prior art and in this case there is also, we have some assistance from the report of the Committee of the Judiciary in reporting out the 1952 Patent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.529" offset="1729494">That report and referred to that in the petitioner's brief, says that Section 103 was the first statutory statement of this particular condition for patentability which is sometimes been referred to as defining what is invention, an illusive term, and that report said Section 103 states this requirement of patentability in the Title.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.187" offset="1840149">It refers to the difference between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art meaning what was known before as described in Section 102.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.382" offset="1888946">Now, here we have a definition of prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.091" offset="1903783">It is, meaning what was known before as described in Section 102.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.653" offset="1933981">But now, it appears that Section 102 was described -- which defines most of the conditions for patentability has seven subsections, but of those only the first ones subsection A refers -- uses this language what was known before.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.858" offset="2010781">And the Committee report in discussing this Section 102 (a) again gives a definition of “What was known before,” and I quote again briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.681" offset="2062085">Section 102 in paragraphs a, b, and c repeats the conditions in the existing law relating to novelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.446" offset="2097194">Subsection a, and that's the one we're concerned with, is the language of the existing law recognizing that the interpretation by the Courts excludes various kinds of private knowledge not known to the pubic.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.416" offset="2165008">And continuing, the interpretation by the Courts of paragraph a, and that's the Section 102 (a), as being more restricted than the actual language would suggest, (for example known has been held to mean publicly known) is recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.904" offset="2238986">So summarizing this chain, we find that in determining what prior art means under Section 103, it says what was means, what was known before as defined in Section 102 and we turn to 102 (a) and it says what was known before means what was publicly known before.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.664" offset="2326026">So that in this instance the Wallace patent that we're talking about which was, at the time the Regis application was filed, a secret application in the Patent Office, was certainly not “prior public knowledge” and we submit that it was not prior art available under Section 103 of the statute upon which the respondent places sole reliance on this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.490" offset="2441383">In addition to the Committee report to which I have referred there have been many decisions over the years, many of the leading decisions, involving what the Committee referred to as the interpretation by the courts to the effect that prior knowledge, and that's used in Section 102, is limited to prior public knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.203" offset="2536155">Those authorities are set forth and analyzed in the brief and I won't repeat them at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.536" offset="2565517">Now, going back again, the patent office said that Regis could not have this patent because the invention was unpatentable over Wallace in view of Carlson.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.954" offset="2615150">Now that is what to be known in the patent regarded again as a combination rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.372" offset="2640854">The disclosures of two or more patents or publications are considered together and combined together to build up a structure, which is shown to be the equivalent of a structure, which is being claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.394" offset="2700936">And whenever a rejection of that sort is being made it is by the authority of Section 103 referring to one of the conditions of patentability that the invention shall not have been obvious over the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.028" offset="2771466">But, and I repeat at the time that Regis made his invention, the Wallace patent was not a part of the prior public knowledge and it was not a prior part of the prior art and it could not be used to show in conjunction with another invention, the invention of Carlson to show whether or not what Regis did was amounted -- or did amount to invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.766" offset="2878464">We also submit Your Honors that the better reasoned decision --</text>

            <text syncTime="706.356" offset="2928828">Your Honor, I definitely do not and as a matte of fact in my brief I referred to a decision, a recent decision by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals which said expressly that Section 102 (e) had nothing -- I'm sorry that was one 102 (b), it had nothing whatever to do with 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.297" offset="2996537">Well, it's our position that 102 (e) likewise has nothing to do with 103.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.560" offset="3081592">Well, that would be true Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.290" offset="3092564">If the Wallace patent or an -- or something insignificant variations of the Wallace patent showed the Regis invention, if that were so, we wouldn't be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.170" offset="3128090">We recognize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.530" offset="3133524">There's no question that the Wallace patent is a reference under, if it can be used, under 102 (e) to show under the -- that that section of that statute uses the word the invention, not some different invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.030" offset="3183470">But here it is not contended that the Wallace patent chose the invention and as a matter of fact the District Court in its opinion explicitly holds that it held that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.469" offset="3225266">At page 70 (a) of the record the District Court in it's opinion said neither the Wallace et al patent nor the Carlson patent alone anticipates the invention described in the claims and suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.063" offset="3275630">Now, that's the finding effect of the District Court, which I believe had not been challenged and I believe it's binding on the appellate tribunals.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.798" offset="3366536">The only way that would be possible to attempt to reconstruct Regis invention was to add those two inventions together and on that it has to become under Section 103 Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.837" offset="3434768">Now, I'd like to make a few comments on the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.143" offset="3471966">This 1952 Patent Act is a little art in a way.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.639" offset="3489938">The Section 102 has seven subsections and Section 103 just a single section, but they all expressed negatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.902" offset="3527032">They say that inventor is entitled to a patent unless one of these, what they term conditions for patentability is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.162" offset="3564022">Now, respondent in its brief cites numerous authorities under Section 102 which Your Honor referred to or under the Alexander Milburn case of this Court which Section 102 (e) codified showing that a co-pending patent for that purpose was a proper reference and we concede that that is a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.564" offset="3661615">But they then from that specific showing attempt to generalize and say “Well, the co-pending patent is relevant, as they say relevant to patentability because it was relevant under this one condition of patentability,” but it then attempted to extend that to all the other conditions of patentability, some of which are very clearly inapplicable because this doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.248" offset="3764328">Now we say that it's a complete non sequitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.862" offset="3774777">The fact that because the Wallace patent maybe a reference under Section 102 (e) that it's there -- by automatically becomes a reference and therefore as they say relevant to patentability under all the other sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.442" offset="3833187">And that the Courts have not so held that we do -- that it was a logical too and there within the meaning or the theory of the Congress to passing that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.841" offset="3866728">There's one other comment which I would like to make with respect to respondent's brief and that is it repeatedly, what we believe misstates the factual situation by reiterating the assertion that the Regis invention is but an insignificant advance over the Wallace patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.598" offset="3949798">Now we have just referred to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.882" offset="3954918">If that were true as Mr. Justice Brennan said, Section 102 in the prior we wouldn't -- but applying we wouldn't be here, but it is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.206" offset="3992221">In our brief I have referred to some of these repeated statements which we believe are misstatements.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.014" offset="4019388">For example, at page 29 in it's brief that states “Now, if both Wallace and Regis patents were to issue for example, a member of the public wishing to use the single patentable invention of Regis and Wallace embodied in both might have to obtain license from both patentees and Wallace the prior inventor might have to obtain a license from Regis, but that is such not the fact, but that assertion or its equivalent is repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.349" offset="4144776">So in conclusion, we submit that the Court, the judgment as the Court below should be reversed first because maybe Wallace patent or – nor Carlson patent shows that Regis was not the first inventor under Section 102 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.204" offset="4208201">And secondly, Wallace patent is not a part of the prior art which then refers that general fund of knowledge available to those go in the art to determine whether the quantum, the amount of advance which Regis made over that prior art allotted to a patentable invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.763" offset="4286464">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.677" offset="4326066">This is one of several cases before the Court this term involving the broad question of whether or not the lower federal courts have properly limited the award of patent monopoly by maintaining adequate standards of patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.330" offset="4388655">This case differs from the others in that here the courts below properly, we submit, resisted the applicant's efforts to lower the standards of patentability and that's to enlarge the patent monopoly. Precise question presented here is whether a co-pending patent is a relevant reference in determining whether an applicant has made a patentable advance in the art under Section 103 of the Patent Act of 1952 and as petitioner's counsel has indicated the petitioner's position is that it is not so available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.106" offset="4535777">So that a patent could issue on an application notwithstanding that an earlier filed co-pending patent had disclosed everything in that application, except what is obvious to the ones field in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.407" offset="4588962">In other words, petitioners will allow a patent issue on an application disclosing no patentable advance over a prior patent and of course, that is exactly what this case involves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.870" offset="5322898">Second, petitioners recognize that all other references that are available to show identical disclosures are also available to show obviousness that petitioners would single out this one kind of reference co-pending patents for special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.605" offset="5397817">And thirdly, petitioners recognize that if the co-pending patent here had issued just two months earlier than it did, that is after three years and eight months in the Patent Office rather than three years and ten months, the disclosure of the Regis application would have been unpatentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.256" offset="5472423">Their contention is that the passage of these two months rendered that application, rendered the disclosure and that application patentable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.477" offset="6169266">Now, the basic doctrine on co-pending patents was initially set forth by this Court in the Alexander Milburn case which the counsel for the petitioners we've already referred to, a 1926 decision of this Court in which Mr. Justice Holmes declared for an unanimous Court that co-pending patents are available references on the issue of patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.732" offset="6274278">Now, that case involved a co-pending patent that made an identical disclosure, but the reasoning of the Court applied equally to co-pending patents who's disclosures rendered an application obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.272" offset="6332479">Thus the Court emphasized the irrationality of penalizing a prior applicant and rewarding a subsequent applicant for the delays of the Patent Office, a consideration no less applicable where the prior application fully discloses the invention and it is where it disclose is enough to make the invention obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.166" offset="6420041">That no distinction could be drawn between these two kinds of disclosures it was authoritatively settled by this Court in Detrola Corporation against Hazeltine Corporation in 1941, that's 313 U. S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.564" offset="6489631">There the Court in our judgment expressly ruled that co-pending patents disclosing all but the obvious are available references on the issue of patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.934" offset="6539160">We've discussed that case at pages 14 and 15 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.799" offset="6558595">You'll notice at the bottom of page 14, the portions we quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.129" offset="6575940">The Court specifically says that co-pending patents are among those that constitute the prior art and now on page 15, the portion that we quote makes it clear that the Court was focusing not on the question of identical disclosure, but on the question of obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.999" offset="6651382">Note the final phrase since it's advance over the prior art if any required only the exercise of the skill of the art that we submit is a clear statement that the Court was speaking in terms of the obviousness issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.109" offset="6707806">That is to say that Section 103 issue as opposed to the Section 102 issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.858" offset="6738840">Now, among the lower court's, while there was a certain amount of confusion over terminology, the great majority of the lower court decisions rendered between the Milburn case and the 1952 Act were in accord with the Detrola decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.154" offset="6803937">Now, one of these 1952 cases does deserve special mention we think, that's Western States Machine Company against SS Hepworth Company, a 1945 Second Circuit decision rendered by Judge Learned Hand, that's discussed at pages 16 to 18 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.493" offset="6877393">There Judge Hand not only expressly recognized the Detrola case as settling the availability of co-pending patents to show unpatentability for obviousness but he painstakingly explained why there is no rational basis for treating co-pending patents differently depending on whether they make an identical disclosure or one that makes the application in question obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.317" offset="6992645">Thus, as of 1952 it had been authoritatively settled by decisions of this Court and of the lower courts that co-pending patents are among the references available in judging obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.343" offset="7044786">In that year the Congress enacted as a part of the Patent Act Section 103 which was the first time codified the rule that the invention is not patentable where the prior art, although not fully disclosing it, has rendered it obvious and “to a person having ordinary skill in the art.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2195.093" offset="8883702">Now, as I began to say to Mr. Justice Brennan Your Honors as of 1952 the decisions of this Court had established without any question that on the issue of obviousness co-pending patents were available references.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.209" offset="8968234">And we do not believe that it can be easily assumed that the Congress would have abrogated those decisions without specifically saying so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.506" offset="9001357">Quite the contrary of course, Congress made it quite clear and in acting the Patent Act of 1952 and specifically with respect to Section 103 that it was intending to codify existing law both statutory and decisional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.461" offset="9073246">Now in the year subsequent to 1952, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has consistency ruled that co-pending patents are available references under Section 103 and of course the District of Columbia Circuit on meeting the question for the first time in the present case has adopted that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.855" offset="9154748">Now, the petitioner has placed great emphasis on the alleged unfairness of using as a reference, a co-pending patent of which an applicant cannot have been aware when he filed his application because of the secrecy accorded patent applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.243" offset="9220368">This argument we believe misconceives the essential nature of the patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.143" offset="9243982">The public does not give patents as a price or cleverness or even ingenuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.773" offset="9274493">It bestows a monopoly in exchange for a measurable benefit to the public in the way of an advance in the useful arts and plainly enough an invention that has been rendered obvious by a prior co-pending patent is if no benefit to the public irrespective of whether or not the applicant himself may have known about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.673" offset="9366026">Thus, the test of patentability if not whether an applicant subjectively believes or has reason to believe he had made an application -- made an invention but whether the invention represents a significant advance over the art objectively viewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.284" offset="9432482">This objectivity of the patent laws is manifested in a number of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.303" offset="9452544">An applicant is charged with knowledge of all of the vast literature in the field including obscure foreign publications of which you couldn't possibly be expected to have knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.765" offset="9494444">An applicant who has conceived a truly inventive idea through a genuine stroke of genius would be denied a patent if someone else had the idea unbeknown to him just a day or two before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.333" offset="9548675">And as petitioners concede, an applicant will be denied a patent if a co-pending patent of which he could not possibly have been aware because of its secrecy fully disclosed his invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.787" offset="9602487">In short, we see no place for an argument that is -- that it is unfair to reject an application that discloses no patentable advance in the art and hence cannot bestow any benefit on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.016" offset="9659434">Frankly, if there is an issue of fairness in this case, we believe it is the public interest in the due circumscription of the patents monopoly that would be dealt with unfairly if petitioner's view were to prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.973" offset="12271261">Now one other point, as I understand that the respondent would have the Court believe that the addition of the Carlson invention to Wallace was an insignificant one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.998" offset="12335313">We think that is not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.862" offset="12342836">Well, there's nothing to indicate that the Carlson invention itself was not a significant invention and therefore the addition of Carlson invention to the invention of Wallace cannot under any sense be termed an insignificant variation over Wallace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.202" offset="12424129">The question that as I point out in my brief there are cases where under Section 102 (e) quite properly the co-pending patent did not have everything, but there were some insignificant variations, I'll use the response positions such as the kind of a cabinet or support or perhaps the use of gears instead of pulleys where it is not necessary to add the invention of somebody else to build up an anticipating structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.633" offset="12537919">But that isn't the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.977" offset="12555264">Counsel for our respondent also referred to the question of fairness which we introduced in our brief and that's the question is it less fair to deny an inventor a patent under Section 102 (e) because of a co-pending of it's patent of which he could not have knowledge that it is here and the answer is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.188" offset="12676159">In the situation of 102 (e) or as presented by Alexander Milburn case if the patent had been granted to the later inventor even though he had no knowledge of the co-pending patent he would then have this in a position to take a way, the right of the actual prior inventor from using his own invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.644" offset="12761945">If in fact a patent had been granted to this second applicant of which even though he had no knowledge, so it has become a question of fairness as between the first inventor and the second inventor. Somebody might be asked to be heard, it seems fairer to hurt the second inventor than the first inventor, but that isn't true here.</text>
