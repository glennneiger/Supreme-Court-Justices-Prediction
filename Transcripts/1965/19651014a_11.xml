            <label>Mr. Orville O. Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="9.578" offset="143715">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.439" offset="159180">The patent before this Court in this case generally referred to as the Graham '798 patent because there was another Graham patent that was cited against us just prior to Graham's patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.262" offset="214455">This patent has been held valid twice in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.313" offset="238696">In the second case before the Fifth Circuit, the same prior art was considered as was considered by the Eighth Circuit and the case has been brought here by certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.139" offset="302017">The record on page 15 had a stipulation and it was -- number 7, it's stipulated that this prior art was the same in the Fifth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.682" offset="364189">With the same prior art before the two circuits, it necessarily made -- means then that there is a clear difference between the circuits as to their test of patentability or the requirements for patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.887" offset="425002">Of course, this brings us to Sections 101, 102 and 103 with the Patent Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.795" offset="464603">The question primarily is then whether the Eighth Circuit applied the proper test the requirements for patentability when they substituted their judgment to that of the trial court, reversed the trial court and held the '798 patent invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.035" offset="537537">Respondents in their brief on page 27, suggests that petitioners are argument at Section 103 established a statutory test to patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.291" offset="578602">It changed existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.395" offset="591036">We don't quite say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.871" offset="604933">But we do say that it changed the law as applied by the Eighth Circuit and we think the Eighth Circuit is wrong in their test and have been for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.222" offset="650282">A few brief comments regarding to the statute since 1790 Congress has enacted the Patent Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.821" offset="688734">And the first one was entitled an Act to promote the progress of useful arts and in that Act and all subsequent patent statutes until 1952 Act they had statutory requirements for patentability have now the end-utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.729" offset="768355">There was no other statutory requirement since the early 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.010" offset="789462">However, this Court in 1850 in the Hotchkiss versus Greenwood applied as a requirement of patentability that the invention be more than they worked over the mechanic in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.320" offset="838677">In other words, in addition of being new and useful it had to involve a greater degree of skill and ingenuity than that possessed by the ordinary mechanic acquainted with the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.517" offset="903461">Down through the years this same rule has been applied with this Court with some verbal variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.980" offset="929374">There's been associated comments in the different opinions and I believe that some of these comments have been taken up by the lower courts and thereby had departed from what this Court has been holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.057" offset="985694">We say the Eighth Circuit is one that has been doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.992" offset="1005338">Even prior to 1952, the Eighth Circuit took position that this Court had raised the standards of originality necessary to sustain patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.229" offset="1058314">In the record, in this case before in the Court on page 925 the Eighth Circuit in its opinion stated this Court has adhered to the position that since Cuno Engineering Corporation versus Automatic Devices Corporation the amount of originality and ingenuity over and beyond now the -- and utility which will constitute invention necessary to sustain a patent for a combination of old elements such as we have here in a crowded art has increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.236" offset="1194360">We also reported from another case in the Eighth Circuit and the part of that quotation they said, “The Supreme Court as we think raised the standards of originality necessary to sustain patents for improvements such as those involved in the instant cases regardless of their usefulness or commercial success.”</text>

            <text syncTime="383.334" offset="1638755">My point is that they have said that it has to produce a new result in order to be patentable.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.865" offset="2060894">That's to say, I gather Mr. Gold that however phrased, the statute indicates to include the old Hotchkiss case, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="497.181" offset="2094122">And I think that in the Cuno case, the AP case, all of the cases before this Court since the Hotchkiss case as Time really had the same basic holding that it had to be non-obvious in order to be patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.645" offset="2155980">And that's -- we are being -- it were that and I think that everyone of the parties before this Court in these cases are in agreement with that as I read the briefs I read all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.832" offset="2196731">I do say, however, that the Eighth Circuit is one of the departures that were referred to by Congress in their reports in connection with the statute when they said that they hoped that the statute particularly Section 103 would bring rare uniformity and reduce these departures that had occurred before.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.927" offset="2281159">We say that the Eighth Circuit has departed and set up there own standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.503" offset="2299444">They have in effect placed additional conditions on the statute and we don't think the Eighth Circuit can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.018" offset="2329537">They have not followed this Court or have they followed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.903" offset="2341031">They have not even applied the statute in connection with our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.253" offset="2358481">They pay lip service to the statute but when it comes right down to what they have said in their decision, all they have said is that the finding of the trial court was that we had an improved functional result and this was not a new result and therefore, the Court had not applied the stricter standards of the Eighth Circuit and so the patent was automatically invalid in that search.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.201" offset="2482197">In order to bolster their opinion, they took the position at even assuming the trial court's findings that valued a significant difference or a new result that they still felt it would be obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.554" offset="2559624">He made the statement that they were making that assumption on page 931 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.999" offset="2589403">I will read the first four lines of the paragraph starting on that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.985" offset="2621377">Furthermore, even assuming that the trial court's findings of a quote, “a slight but significant difference in the flexing of the forward portion of the shank that is not found in the prior art,” can be construed as finding a new result.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.590" offset="2691803">And then they went on to discuss the case and say that this was an erroneous finding at the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.876" offset="2716881">However, I want to call your attention to the fact that after they had discussed what the case and what the structure did.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.332" offset="2754706">That they then concluded from that assumption that it might provide a new result.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.845" offset="2784799">Well, perhaps more efficient, the inversion of the parts so as to allow the shank to flex downwardly away from the plate above it did not bring about a significant new or different result and would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.335" offset="2866719">We think that probably made an assumption that was a new result they turn right around and said, his stewardess and provided new results so it's obvious and that's all they did in their test in which they were applying with that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.445" offset="2923248">It is our position that the Eighth Circuit has applied a standard or test in the requirements of patentability that they have set up themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.760" offset="2976434">It is stricter than anything that this Court has ever applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.166" offset="2998063">It does not comply with a statute and that this Court didn't get supervisory authority should reverse the Court on that point and didn't help to bring out more uniformity under these decisions on patent cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.638" offset="4751924">We say that the Eighth Circuit did not actually give consideration to this patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.823" offset="4780763">The structure was new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.148" offset="4790063">The respondents admitted in their brief on page 28 that the particular arrangement of the elements shown in the '798 patent was not shown in the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.916" offset="4837083">The '798 structure had utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.260" offset="4850458">There was a Jeff Roy clamp, I think it's Exhibit C which was held to infringe in an earlier suit and it was stipulated that it was a commercial success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.854" offset="4900822">That was stipulation number four in the record page 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.222" offset="4918272">So there's no dispute that a structure such as these clamps and the respondent's clamps also were successful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.840" offset="4956829">So there we come primarily to a question as to the obviousness of the structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.704" offset="4980234">In a -- talking about that I would like to comment first on the problem involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.741" offset="5000401">In the wheat countries they do what they call chisel plowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.803" offset="5016597">These are frames matted on wheels that have big shanks that go back and rip open the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.364" offset="5046899">Originally, where there was not much rocks they had the front end of the shank which if you please is about 2 inches wide and three-quarters to an inch thick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.509" offset="5091412">They were held immobile on the frame but they would rip through the ground and there were some flexibility in the shank back behind a framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.236" offset="5138328">There's no difficulty when there was no rocks but when these cut valves are moved into the rocky erritory the glacial country up in North Dakota and Montana, South Dakota, those valves were torn up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.455" offset="5187229">When you move a plow at maybe 6 miles an hour across the ground ripping down deep in the ground and it catches onto a rock its immobile, something has to give and it's going to be the plow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.634" offset="5247937">So, there was an effort made to try to eliminate the breakage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.851" offset="5268835">Our client Mr. Graham did arrive at a structure that solved their problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.909" offset="5873100">It has a spring that tends to urge the shank and the plate up against the fixed member and that's what we have referred to as home based position</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.551" offset="5907581">Normal plowing would have the point of the plow in the ground and the spring hold this forward end up against the plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.611" offset="5943839">Now, if you hit hard spots in the ground there's going to be a tendency for the plate to hinge downwardly and it will cause the spring here, this Number 65 to compress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.534" offset="5995562">That allows the -- an opening you might say of this hinge member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.279" offset="6018550">That will occur and there would be some flexibility in the shank some bending back behind the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.061" offset="6049688">The main thing is when the point of this plow hits the rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.088" offset="6073720">When that hits a rock it's going to have to move up to go over the rock and that can be done as the hinge is down here compressing the spring and that will help to jump over this rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.800" offset="6132652">If it doesn't completely jump, with the compression of this spring and the bending of the shank then you can still have damage and shock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.093" offset="6169746">Now, our structure is such that when it's -- in move -- hinging it up it will flex down in this portion of the shank below that plate member.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.011" offset="6277475">It was a Rick's patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.217" offset="6286252">There was also in the same year a Cob patent and it was -- in our judgment the same structure that was later made by Glencoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.404" offset="6335049">And you will hear the respondents say that all we have done is turn over the shank and this hinge plate that in effect is the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.450" offset="6391265">In the Glencoe structure, the shank is above the plate but in such a way that the -- (Inaudible) -- in such a way that the -- when it flexes or when it swings up, the shank will be against the plate and it will tend to push it against it and keep it from flexing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.690" offset="6484156">It will hold down solid so all the stress is back behind the plate that gets then into a position such as we had with the fixed clamps where this excessive bending in the back will cause stress and break each of the shanks, be -- bend beyond the elastic limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.763" offset="6552492">They do have some bending above the shank but -- if Your Honor please, there is a sketch in Volume 3 of the record, that would be plaintiff's Exhibit W on page 653.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.288" offset="6722602">That will go -- that would tend to show a form of what would be similar to Rick's, Glencoe, and those prior patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.926" offset="6769100">That particular sketch was a rough sketch to show an idea of what would happen with the old structures and in those -- when it swung down the stirrup or loop that goes over the shank forms a fulcrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.168" offset="6866066">Now, and it forces up on the left of the drawing in the rear of the clamp, it tends to force forward end of the shank down against the plate of the hinge as it force it down, the bending is back at the rear of the clamp so you have all of the excessive bending at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.742" offset="7064388">A question was asked to Mr. Gold concerning the test applied in the Eighth Circuit and he read a statement from the opinion of the Eighth Circuit wherein the Eighth Circuit disapproved a rule which would find invention for mere improvement as long ago as 1876.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.291" offset="7170550">This Court in Reckendorfer versus Faber said, "Perfection of workmanship however much it may increase the convenience extend the use or diminish expense is not patentable.</text>

            <label>Mr. S. Tom Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="1810.851" offset="7348809">Now, then we will come to the answer of that specific question by analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.024" offset="7369498">My point here is to show that it has long been the rule of this Court that mere perfection of workmanship mere improvement, mere increased deficiency or economy is not enough for patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.879" offset="7424982">Now, then another remark counsel made which I would like to answer specifically before turning to the body of the case, I believe, he stated that he did not contend that 10 -- Section 103 changed the law and it's rather difficult to understand that statement when at page 23 of the brief he says, "Congress in Section 101, 102, and 103 of the Patent Act of 1952 provided a statutory definition under requirements of patentability."</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.250" offset="7554445">This was a change from the standards of invention of the judicial opinions expressed from the decades immediately preceding the Patent Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.788" offset="7592584">The Patent Act was expression of the clear intent by Congress to return or restore the old requirements laid down in Hotchkiss versus Greenwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.543" offset="7631559">My point simply is and I believe we have traced it in chronological order through the brief that since Hotchkiss versus Greenwood right straight down through the last expression of this Court in A&amp;P the rule has been to determine patentability in a combination of old elements case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.836" offset="7708776">The question they rule has been or the question has been whether or not the combination amounts to an advance beyond that which would be expected of a person having ordinary skill in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.018" offset="7761544">And I say that the Court if that's exactly what Section 103 says, there isn't there maybe some change in the language of it but there cannot be any change in the meaning of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.446" offset="7803235">I think all of the circuits with the exception of the Second Circuit and two decisions by Justice Learned Hand have reached that conclusion and I believe that in following the history of it the position is irrefutable that that is what Section 103 means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.840" offset="7864780">That's what Congress said in the Committee Reports and with one or two exceptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.638" offset="7999990">Now, we can free the test any way we want to when you come to apply to specific factual situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.591" offset="8035830">As the Court said, as Mr. Justice Jackson said in A&amp;P case, Mr. Justice Douglas said in his concurring opinion there, as was said in several of the cases prior to that time, when you come to a combination situation where there is nothing new, there is no new element, no new mechanical element and all that is new if there is anything new is merely in the arrangement, the particular combination of those mechanical elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.382" offset="8154948">Then, how do you determine whether or not it is above and beyond the expected skill the ordinary man having normal expected capacity in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.709" offset="8196221">And this Court has said when you come to that situation in Lincoln Engineering for example it said it's not enough if all it does is produce an old result in a more efficient way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.047" offset="8253586">And in A&amp;P it said, "Only, only in that type of case can it amount to invention?</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.057" offset="8285665">Can it be an advance beyond the expected skill of the art if it does produce some new unexpected or surprising result or consequence, some new unexpected or surprising function of a part or combined functions of parts?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.164" offset="8378034">That's what the Eighth Circuit is saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.618" offset="8387856">It is merely saying the same thing this Court said in A&amp;P.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.971" offset="9401302">Now, if I may, let me turn the Court's attention to the patent here in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.678" offset="9424081">I know that this patent is not of any great national significance yet, nevertheless, these questions must be decided in the context of the facts and the patents before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.666" offset="9476117">Let's see what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.060" offset="9481655">Let's see what the problem was and what was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.834" offset="9496806">Now, let's eliminate a little chat to before we start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.465" offset="9515301">This is a spring clamp for attaching the shank of a ground working tool to the frame of a plow so that it may pivot under forces from rocks or other obstructions in the soil and return to operating position by means of a spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.698" offset="9612163">Now, in a simple language that's all it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.117" offset="9625851">Now, the first thing I want to make absolutely clear is that's not new with this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.289" offset="9646540">That goes back, that business of a spring clamp or (Inaudible) resiliently attaching a shank to a -- to the frame of a tool is at least since 1875 that goes back at least that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.310" offset="9710696">There's not any new plowing result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.598" offset="9719787">This is a chisel plow, chisel plow is a -- in a modern sense at least go back to 1935, spring clamps or chisel plows at least go back to 1946 or 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.887" offset="9772972">So this didn't bring about a new plowing result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.747" offset="9784362">It was not a new idea on a mounting of a shank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.183" offset="9802125">It was not a new spring clamp or a chisel plow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.766" offset="9816440">None of those broad things were present here or accomplished here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.492" offset="9831382">And in order to define anything inventive or that might even approach inventiveness in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.482" offset="9867327">We have to come down to the elements that are involved in their arrangements and their accomplishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.833" offset="9896793">Now, here again let's eliminate chat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.357" offset="9906824">It is conceded and found that every single mechanical element here is old and that couldn't be -- there couldn't be any question about that to at least 75 years old in this particular art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.081" offset="9957710">There isn't even any contention or could there be any contention here that this was the first time all of these elements had been confined in a spring clamp or a chisel plow because that had all been done by Mr. Ralph in the Glencoe clamp at least 2 years earlier than Mr. Graham by stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.456" offset="10039212">So what is it here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.327" offset="10050706">And the only way you can answer that question I think is to look at it from the standpoint of the problem unless thus examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.289" offset="10082576">Mr. Graham had an old spring clamp which is called '811.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.046" offset="10101593">Working on these plows, for these shanks and he had some problems with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.036" offset="10121550">He had some wear problems with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.617" offset="10131895">He had a rather unusual arrangement in that the shank pivoted about a point on the heel of the clamp rather than around its pivot pin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.367" offset="10162928">And also, he didn't have a true fastening means to fasten his shank to his hinge member so that there was a sliding movement as the thing worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.589" offset="10195738">Well, he had two problems of wear, one at the rear where the shank scrubbed on the butt of his clamp and one at the front where it pulled on its spring rod.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.207" offset="10234295">So, what did he do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.198" offset="10238161">He set out to solve that problem, those problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.578" offset="10255715">He turned his hinge member upside down and fastened it together with a bolt at the front and a loop underneath to hold it up at the rear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.476" offset="10299288">Now that's what he did and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.831" offset="10312767">You could study this record and you can phrase it any way you want to and that's all you can make of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.040" offset="10337531">He took these old elements which were ready available right there in the art and rearrange them slightly and that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.961" offset="10377237">Now, then what did that accomplish?</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.837" offset="10388731">Well, first of all let's address ourselves to the obviousness of that questions, of the structure itself aside from what happened to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.296" offset="10426556">Now, if you have a shank which pivots about a point and it's rubbing at that point, what would be the obvious and common sense thing for anybody to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.428" offset="10475144">It would be to put a pivotal bearing there wouldn't it to eliminate the rubbing contact instead of a sliding pivot to have a full pivot, an ordinary full pivot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.108" offset="10517880">That's what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.283" offset="10522582">That's what the art did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.085" offset="10529792">That's what we use in all of the art except his own '811 patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.825" offset="10548705">And his other problem was the slipping and sliding of the shank and pulling on his spring rod which caused to wear at the front.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.078" offset="10581723">But what would be the obvious answer to that if your -- if you have a one spring rod coming through here which carries all this big (Inaudible) to the -- of the shank if it works back and forth and that binds the spring rod so that It can't go up and down as he wants it to, to carry the spring pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.392" offset="10647030">What would you do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.884" offset="10652985">What would anybody do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.661" offset="10660091">Fasten them together to take the load off the spring rod.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.528" offset="10675555">Well now, when he did those two things he accomplished it wear reduction as a relay to his '811 clamp, his old clamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.642" offset="10719963">Yes, he improved his old '811 clamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.626" offset="10731875">He reduced some wear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.623" offset="10739921">But, that had been fully accomplished in the Glencoe clamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.312" offset="10758625">Glencoe had a rotating pivot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.140" offset="10770014">Glencoe had a hinge member which did exactly that same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.850" offset="10784852">Glencoe had fastened the shank to the hinge member to take fully load off the spring clamp before Graham did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.566" offset="10815676">So, not only did he use the obvious aside from any art, in addition to that, those things were taught in the very art in which he was working.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.842" offset="10876803">Now, I'm not overlooking what he now asserts in the courthouse as the heart of his inventive concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.447" offset="10935212">I've left that because it must be dealt with and it must be destroyed as the Eighth Circuit destroyed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.273" offset="10966559">He says now and this has never raised or mentioned in the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.772" offset="10984532">It's not mentioned in the specifications of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.821" offset="10996652">It's not mentioned in the (Inaudible) or history or proceedings before the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.477" offset="11019327">It's not mentioned in the claims but in the courthouse now he says, "Yes, but when I turned the plate and shank upside down that permits my shank to bend down away from the plate in this area where it contacts the plate and that makes a more resilient shock absorbing structure than I had before and consequently that is a new accomplishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.626" offset="11131967">That is a significant consequence which entitles me to a patent."</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.974" offset="11157358">Well in the first place, I think it's rather strange that if that was such an important feature, that it would never have been mentioned at all until it got to the courthouse and you can search the record from front to back and that's -- you will see that its never been mentioned until it got to when it got to the Courthouse and it also strikes me as strange that that could be relied upon as a feature of importance to sustain this patent an accomplishment in advance beyond the expected skill of the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.645" offset="11299986">An unobvious result if you please, or a non-obvious structure if you please, which would entitle him to a patent when his own expert says, “Do you regard the small degree of flex in the in the forward end of the shank that lies between the pivot point and the point of spring attachment to be of any significance or any importance to the functioning of a device such as '798?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.090" offset="11397789">Answer: Unless you're approaching the elastic limit I think the flexing will reduce the maximum stress at the point of pivot there where the maximum stress does occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.569" offset="11435719">I think it were reduced that, I don't know how much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.022" offset="11449511">Question: Do you think it is a substantial factor, a factor of importance in the functioning of the structure?</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.297" offset="11474589">Answer: Not a great factor, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.463" offset="11487232">And in the Jeffrey case which had been tried sometime earlier a similar testimony was given and is also reported in this record that you consider this portion that you call a resilient action of the shank Mr. Fenton in the forward 8 or 9 inches that's up inside the mounting of the bracket important to the function of the device?</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.219" offset="11562256">Answer: Not to important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.498" offset="11567376">It's present but it's not too important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.755" offset="11576466">Question: It would function just as well whether that were there or not, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2874.914" offset="11605096">Question: I think it would essentially, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.543" offset="11615545">So, this great important thing that's been the advance beyond the art now even it's own expert says it's unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.421" offset="11655147">Well now, looking at this device in summation of what was done and what was accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.365" offset="11698928">It didn't change the way it plowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.261" offset="11710422">It didn't the way it pivoted except that it pivoted around the bearing instead of a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.559" offset="11735604">It didn't change the action of the shank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.394" offset="11746994">It didn't change the plowing result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.079" offset="11757756">It didn't change the main body of the clamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.494" offset="11767369">It didn't change the springs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.654" offset="11776042">It didn't change anything except the relative position of the shank and the hinge member and the fastening means and that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.467" offset="11807284">Now, if that be an invention, if that be an advance which any Court will say would entitle a man to a 17-year monopoly then it seems to me that we have gone up long way down the road of destroying any validity of the patent system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.461" offset="11903310">Now, let me turn my attention or if I may to the history of this litigation just a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.080" offset="11933717">Of course, we recognize that we have here former decisions of the Fifth Circuit upholding this patent twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.056" offset="11965691">But I don't' think there can be any doubt whatsoever about the basis of validity in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.791" offset="12000590">You can search both opinions in the first of the Jeffrey cases and in Hotchkiss case both of which I have set out the -- in principle part in the brief to find the basis for the holding of validity in the Fifth Circuit and you can come up with only conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.260" offset="12070494">And that is that the patent was sustained in the Fifth Circuit because it produced as it thought a more efficient and more economic result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.630" offset="12115947">Listen to these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.175" offset="12122112">It still seems to us that it's hybrid type structure combining the wear resisting rotating pivot in part reminiscent of the prior art with a new shank and stirrup arrangements permitting some of the same advantageous flexibility inherent of the old '811 structure reveals sufficient indicia of novelty and invention to justify limited protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.571" offset="12211660">The further rule and this is the only place you can find anything that looks like a rule in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.377" offset="12230886">The further rule along recognized by this Court that an improvement combination is patentable even though its constituent elements are singularly revealed by the prior art where as here it produces an old result in a cheaper and otherwise more advantageous way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.880" offset="12300894">And if that weren't enough to establish what the real rule is, look on to the Hotchkiss case which followed some three years later and the Court said this, “It is only because this particular arrangement of these known elements adopted by Graham achieves the result better than the prior art afforded, better than the prior art afforded that Graham was entitled to a patent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.369" offset="12398905">That's the rule in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.643" offset="12404025">There was no attempt to follow the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.648" offset="12411967">There was no attempt to apply the rule --</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.873" offset="12616871">It doesn't call it a test laid down by this Court or by the statute or any other test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.926" offset="12637142">It's the only circuit that I know anything about that says that, "A better result alone is now enough, is enough."</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.289" offset="12666608">It's only Court I know off that says such a rule as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.980" offset="12677371">Now turning to the Eighth Circuit, if I may, I'd like to direct the Court's attention to the square and true and complete holding of the Eighth Circuit and let's not take it the tidbits to find out what the true context is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.200" offset="12738184">Here is what the Court said, “Furthermore, even assuming that the trial court's finding of a slight but significant difference in the flexing of the forward portion of the shank, that is not found in the prior art can be construed as a finding of a new result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.616" offset="12815924">The Court's further finding, now if the Court followed this, the Court's further finding that patent '798 exhibits invention and would not have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art is clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.318" offset="12886664">The alleged patentable difference between the '798 structure and the prior art lies in the arrangement in the '798 structure of the shank below the plate of the pivoted member permitting the shank to flex throughout it's link and particularly permitting the forward portion of the shank to flex downwardly away from the plate theoretically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.745" offset="12984362">And listen to this, theoretically, at least, when the plate is below the shank as in the prior art there is a tendency of the shank to bend against the plate and when the plate is above as in '798 there is a tendency of the shank to bend away from the plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.413" offset="13071088">And let me stop there and direct our attention to the question again of obviousness under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.119" offset="13105883">If the plate lies underneath the shank in the prior art and the shank bends downwardly against the plate, what will happen if you change the positions and move the plate above retaining a fulcrum point above as is was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.622" offset="13195954">What's going to happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.195" offset="13202223">Which way can it be in?</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.422" offset="13211105">The only way and the obvious way is it will now been away from the plate instead of toward it, is that predictable?</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.985" offset="13245377">Is that the expected?</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.429" offset="13251124">Is that what any high school physic student would say would happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.254" offset="13266484">By any imagination can that be construed as an unexpected structure or an unexpected result an unobvious things?</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.049" offset="13301593">Let's finish then with what the Eighth Circuit said about this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.524" offset="13319565">But it's this difference, they pointed out the difference in the bending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.956" offset="13333253">But is this difference significant enough to support the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.172" offset="13350076">We think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.388" offset="13358958">Painstaking examination of the entire record including the testimony of the experts convinces us that the changes in the prior art and the '798 involved only the application and mechanical ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.772" offset="13412456">There's no adequate evidentiary support for the Court's findings and going on that says and would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.276" offset="13450491">Let me sum up by bringing in some other ancillary things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.900" offset="13468985">Frequently, if a case is a closed case the Court's rely upon these make weights, I call them validity crutches in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.474" offset="13511304">Such thing as commercial excess -- success, a long felt want, inability of others to solve the problem, immediate solving of the problem by this device, immediate copying and adoption by others, none of which are present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.277" offset="13590507">Graham has never manufactured or sold this device at all or regardless of what he says about his merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.309" offset="13618615">And all these years he's never done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.125" offset="13629900">There, the only commercial success was commercial success achieved by Jeffrey Manufacturing Company who are only -- market with their device more than a year prior to the time this patent even issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.930" offset="13677129">There's no finding of any copying in this case by anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.867" offset="13692907">As a matter of fact the only way that there was a finding of infringement in the trial court was upon adoption of equivalence not because the claim to the patent could be read upon these devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.777" offset="13736479">There's no evidence of any long felt want here when the problem arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.179" offset="13750168">It was solved immediately by some sketching and the filing of a patent application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.846" offset="13768767">There's no evidence here of any long experimentation or wrestling with a tough problem that just didn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.643" offset="13796039">I say to the Court that this patent represents a derelict which the Eighth Circuit after a full and careful review has said is not entitled to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.994" offset="13849433">And under the record, the undisputed facts in this case, the achievement of this device if there is any at all is so nominal and so clear and would have been so obvious to even a high school physics student that its simply is not entitled to a statutory monopoly for 17 years or any other years.</text>

            <text syncTime="4141.461" offset="16671284">They said we are out of the range of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.787" offset="16684554">We're free, we can use the idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.524" offset="16695526">I think that the record clearly indicates that they did want to use this structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.651" offset="16716006">I would like to make one other comment or two if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.778" offset="16736486">There was a contention that this was something that was brought forth in the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.925" offset="16761145">The patent disclosed the structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.978" offset="16773371">There was no contention any place that it didn't teach how to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.698" offset="16792179">And I believe that that's all the statute requires us to do in describing an invention we must disclose it so that is sufficient for others to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.666" offset="16828123">And that was the case here and we feel that you don't necessarily describe all the functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.300" offset="16854664">You certainly don't claim functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.375" offset="16862919">That has been criticized in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.149" offset="16870024">You claim structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.241" offset="16874412">We did that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.883" offset="16880995">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>
