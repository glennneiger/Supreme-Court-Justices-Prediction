            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 396, Hugo DeGregory, Appellant, versus Attorney General of the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.150" offset="236022">Mr. Whiteside.</text>

          <turn speaker="howard_s_whiteside" startTime="34.900" stopTime="361.118">
            <label>Mr. Howard S. Whiteside</label>
            <text syncTime="34.900" offset="243022">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.323" offset="256711">This case arises on an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire which affirmed a decision of the Superior Court of New Hampshire, ordering the appellant in this case committed to jail for one year or until he purge himself for a civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.189" offset="332152">Involved is a statute of New Hampshire which is quoted on page 2 of my brief, Chapter 588, Section 8 (a) which is part of the New Hampshire Subversive Activities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.512" offset="405400">And the first sentence says, “At any time when the Attorney General has information which he deems reasonable or reliable relating to violations of the provisions of this Chapter, he shall make full and complete investigation thereof and shall report to the general court for results of this investigation together with his recommendations, if any, for legislation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="96.833" offset="490663">This case originated in November of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.435" offset="513128">You recall the statute, I just read says, if the Attorney General has information -- reasonable and reliable information concerning violations of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.412" offset="557014">Now, what triggered the start of this investigation in November of 1963 was no new evidence of subversive activities in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.614" offset="597870">No sudden reappearance of the Communist Party of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.174" offset="612080">What triggered it was that Hugo DeGregory, the appellant in this case came into the Superior Court in New Hampshire and purged himself of contempt in a previous proceeding by answering in the negative the question, “Are you presently a member of the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="144.318" offset="680626">So, he left the court a freeman and two days later, the Attorney General issued a subpoena to have him appear for further investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.177" offset="724093">I have referred to the previous proceeding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.619" offset="741857">The New Hampshire Subversive Activities Act was passed in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.005" offset="759411">In 1953, a temporary statute permitting investigation by the Attorney General was adopted which not only provided that he might investigate as to violations of the chapter but provided that he might investigate as to the presence of subversive persons within the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.904" offset="834957">This was continued in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.267" offset="844466">In 1957, the legislature adopted the present statute which dropped the clause about the presence of subversive persons in New Hampshire and reads as I read it to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.773" offset="906428">The previous statute was involved in the cases of Sweezy versus New Hampshire and Wyman versus Uphaus both of which came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.990" offset="951359">The present statute was involved in the previous DeGregory case, DeGregory versus the Attorney General of New Hampshire which was decided without argument per curiam by this Court, 368 U.S. 19 with four justices dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.521" offset="1057416">Now -- and thereby upheld a New Hampshire decision saying that the Act was constitutional on its face and constitutional as applied to the facts in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.717" offset="1110288">So as a result, I did not argue below the constitutionality of the statute on its face, although, it would be open to this Court to reconsider it if it so wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.271" offset="1152502">My argument was based on whether the construction court on the statute by the New Hampshire courts went so far as to deny to appellant his rights under the United States Constitution, the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.814" offset="1246647">And so when he was summoned or let me interject this.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.221" offset="1264306">This case depends very much on the facts, the law has been cited, the cases have been cited which are very familiar to you, Sweezy, Uphaus, Watkins, Wilkinson, Braden, Barenblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.690" offset="1322088">They're all cited in the briefs and it seems to me that it is more profitable to determine on the facts of this case, what is the applicable law?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.903" offset="1370990">Now, I might also advert to the fact that I have cited cases and among the cases which I already spoke off, some of those also say it but on page 13 of my brief, I've quoted two recent United States Supreme Court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.438" offset="1437132">Where there is a significant encroachment upon personal liberty, the State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest which is compelling, Bates versus Little Rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.551" offset="1481540">And again, the decisions of this Court have consistently held that only a compelling state interest in the regulation of the subject in justified limiting First Amendment freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.462" offset="1525217">So, I turn to the start of this proceeding before the Attorney General and --</text>

            <text syncTime="370.682" offset="1586134">On the -- on the majority decisions of this Court, that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.573" offset="1605674">They balance the rights of the individual against the rights of the State under the circumstances to see whether the State as such urgent reason for action as to warrant infringement of what otherwise would be the individual's rights under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.837" offset="1674742">You will find that --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Howard S. Whiteside</label>
            <text syncTime="397.169" offset="1692087">Well, there is the view -- there is the view Mr. Justice that the First Amendment is exactly what it says and cannot be limited but that is not then the majority view of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.270" offset="1736495">The majority view of this Court as said that the rights of the individual under the First Amendment or the Fourth Amendment maybe infringed only when the State shows an urgent necessity or compelling reason for doing so.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.327" offset="1824684">Did I say infringed?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="430.878" stopTime="434.998">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="430.878" offset="1826879">If you have a right under the Constitution, it can't be infringed at all, isn't that right?</text>

          <turn speaker="howard_s_whiteside" startTime="434.998" stopTime="781.472">
            <label>Mr. Howard S. Whiteside</label>
            <text syncTime="434.998" offset="1843388">I think I get what Your Honor is driving at.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.889" offset="1854882">The right of the individual is limited under certain emergency circumstances so that the use of the word 'infringed' is wrong, I should have used the word 'limited'.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.402" offset="1909008">Now, the record of the hearing before the Attorney General under this summons is found on page 26 of the record and it goes on for some pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.272" offset="1960417">And the appellant through his attorney inquired immediately as to what the foundation of the Attorney General was for this new proceeding, what he was investigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.810" offset="2018617">And the Attorney General said that first of all, he didn't admit that he had to show any basis for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.595" offset="2073788">He have to show a form of probable cause and then he -- on page 28, he referred to -- in very general terms, the Communist Party as it existed in the late 1940s nationally and internationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.841" offset="2150693">And then he said, there is extensive documentary -- documented sworn testimony to the effect that Hugo DeGregory has been for a long active within the Communist Party of the state and on the later page, he said that -- no, I'll leave it with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.294" offset="2228537">And with that, the attorney for the appellant said, when, where, what is this sworn testimony?</text>
            <text syncTime="537.556" offset="2253615">What year does it applied to?</text>
            <text syncTime="539.478" offset="2261243">Where was it?</text>
            <text syncTime="540.647" offset="2265945">And the Attorney General went no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.183" offset="2276080">And so the appellant made the following sworn statement in this proceeding and I may interject.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.753" offset="2318399">He later repeated that under oath in the Court when the proceeding got to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.388" offset="2344939">“I would like to state Mr. Gall that I am not now a member of the Communist Party and have not been at any time since the authority you have cited for Revised Statutes Annotated Chapter 588, Section 8 (a) that I have no knowledge of any Communist activities in New Hampshire during this period or of any violations RSA 588 during this period of six and one-half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.590" offset="2445772">In fact, I am not even aware of the existence of a Communist Party in the State of New Hampshire at any time the authority you have cited, Section 8 (a) has been on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.141" offset="2483911">And in view of the foregoing, I do not understand what it is I have to face here today.”</text>
            <text syncTime="600.817" offset="2506689">And the only reply of the Assistant Attorney General was, “Well, we have some questions to ask you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="606.466" offset="2529259">And so, proceeding from there, he asked questions such as, “Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?</text>
            <text syncTime="614.679" offset="2562069">Have you ever been an officer of Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="617.361" offset="2572831">And each time the appellant would say, “When?</text>
            <text syncTime="620.504" offset="2585370">What period are you talking about?”</text>
            <text syncTime="622.711" offset="2594252">And the Attorney General would say, “Any period.”</text>
            <text syncTime="625.338" offset="2604701">And so the appellant under those circumstances and in view of the sworn statement that he gave declined to answer those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.334" offset="2640750">And then we came to the next stage before the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.923" offset="2655065">The Attorney General filed a petition in the Superior Court under the appropriate New Hampshire statute to have the appellant ordered to answer the questions or held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.089" offset="2699682">The appellant filed an answer which among other things set up the unconstitutionality of the proceeding as so applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.891" offset="2742941">In the court, there was a long discussion as to foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.456" offset="2757151">The Attorney General again said that he didn't really feel that he needed to establish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.117" offset="2779826">And then he went on to mention again the sworn testimony in the file and he was challenged repeatedly on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.217" offset="2812217">“Produce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.869" offset="2814830">What year does it refer to?</text>
            <text syncTime="680.048" offset="2823607">Where is it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="680.731" offset="2826324">And the court never ordered him to produce it or spends part of the year and he never did.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.399" offset="2844923">And in fact, the court's decision later was not based on this statement of unknown sworn statements in the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.577" offset="2873657">It was based solely on a report which I will get to shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.466" offset="2897272">It developed that the Attorney General really was relying on the 1955 Report of the Attorney General of New Hampshire to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.191" offset="2944188">That report was attached as an exhibit in the Uphaus case in 360 U.S. here and is on file, a number of copies in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.696" offset="2990164">In view of that, the parties in this case have stipulated that we would not file the whole document.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.742" offset="3022346">It's about 250 pages and it's getting very scarce and I say, there are so many cases on file in the courts among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.811" offset="3054634">And so, I named pages 204 to 206 of that document as part of the record because they had been referred to in the court hearing and because they deal specifically with the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.295" offset="3116596">The appellee, Attorney General, asked me to stipulate that he would have the right to refer to other parts of the document and argument and I so stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.955" offset="3163199">And in appendices to his brief, he has referred to other parts of the document which he does not give a page number on so I don't know where they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.288" offset="3200502">I don't even have a copy of that document at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.258" offset="3212413">But I do have some notes as to certain references he made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.089" offset="7427741">Now, our courts, New Hampshire Supreme Court is very familiar as I cited on page 10 of my brief with this type of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.329" offset="7456684">They've been informed in the Sweezy case and the Uphaus case by this Court the proper application to be applied in this instance and they have been affirmed in the second Uphaus case and later DeGregory case as to the application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.586" offset="7517706">It's our contention that once the appellate court concludes that the lower court has applied the appropriate law, the proper law of the case, it's not the duty of the appellate court to substitute their judgment but that of the lower court but whether or not there is adequate evidence in the record to sustain the position of the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.489" offset="7597328">Basically, three problems that I find involved this case, one, that has been raised would be the staleness issue which relates to the nexus between the subject under investigation and the individual witness Mr. DeGregory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.327" offset="7652707">The compelling interest of a state would be the second interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.386" offset="7668903">Now, the one point which distinguishes the present case of DeGregory versus the Attorney General from the prior case is a lapse of time of roughly three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.008" offset="7723447">Everything else is basically the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.990" offset="7739329">Now, once the Court has determined that there is a valid fact-finding hearing and investigation has been started properly, it's the duty of the State to tie the witness into this investigation to show a proper nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.703" offset="7802232">Now, the subject under investigation here is generally communism in and affecting the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.029" offset="7831489">The basis being that the interest here is self-preservation -- which has been -- of the State of New Hampshire which has been long stated by this Court as a valid interest of investigation by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.270" offset="7884466">The subject of investigation is the Communist Party which has been held by this Court in the Barenblatt case specifically as a -- the Communist Party is different than any other political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.837" offset="7938696">Its basic nature, its aim, the ultimate overthrow of our form of government, our democratic form of government, has been held to be a valid area of investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.246" offset="7980387">And the vehicle for the investigation has been held valid as I've cited in the cases in my brief is the legislative fact-finding committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.493" offset="8013302">In this case, the Attorney General is appointed as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.820" offset="8030647">And -- now with reference to the nexus involved, the following is a brief resume of the witnesses' relationship to the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.392" offset="8084982">In Appendix K of my brief, cited at page 78, it indicates that DeGregory was a candidate in Massachusetts for Lieutenant Governor in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.360" offset="8132838">The Daily Worker named him as a member of the Communist Political Association in '42.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.109" offset="8155826">In '45, he was on the letterhead of the Communist Party in Massachusetts as Secretary-Treasurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.938" offset="8179127">Now, this is in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.063" offset="8187591">He was active in the Communist Party in Massachusetts in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.847" offset="8202742">He was a paid functionary in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.636" offset="8213922">Now, in Appendix H of my brief at page 65, it describes the relationship of Massachusetts -- following New England states is for the exception of Connecticut were considered District 1 of the Communist Party and they all were tied up together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.572" offset="8289677">Now, in 1950, DeGregory moved to New Hampshire where he presently resides also it indicates, I'm now back to Appendix K, that he was active in New Hampshire from '46 to '48 which would tie up the relationship between Massachusetts and New Hampshire.</text>
