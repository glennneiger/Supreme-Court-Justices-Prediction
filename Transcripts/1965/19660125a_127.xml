            <text syncTime="5.814" offset="126621">Mr. Solicitor General, you may continue your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="9.293" offset="140518">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.773" offset="154415">When we recessed yesterday, I had covered the fact that the dissident during his lifetime had set up these trusts and as to the disposition to be made of these trusts and pointed out that in the trust instruments themselves, the dissident and his co-trustees retained the power over the disposition of the trust income.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.855" offset="254830">And I also pointed out that it appeared to be conceded that the corpus of the trusts, the original stocks were admittedly covered under Section 811 of the 1939 Code and that under that statute the value of the dissident's debts and the shares of stock which constitute this original trust should be lumped in.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.124" offset="355871">And that the only point was whether or not what had accumulated as a result of the holding of the stock was to be included in the dissident's estate as you read Section 811.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.723" offset="410311">The Seventh Circuit said the original corpus went into the gross estate but the accumulated interest stocks and whatever you might call it, did not come under 811 and it's the Government's position that this was clear error because it was more in line with the purpose of 811 to include all in the dissident's gross estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.379" offset="516890">The reason for that is two-fold and we take the position that when the statute says, “all property”, it meant just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.202" offset="564224">That the stocks that were included were put into the trust and they were not actually transferred until after the dissident's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.830" offset="610722">The real point of dispute or the word “transfer” is that the taxpayer says that the transfer occurred when the trust was set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.381" offset="652936">It's our position that the transfer did not actually occur until the dissident's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.068" offset="679685">And we say also that the property normally would include whatever came about as a result of the action of the trustees, the three trustees including the dissident.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.828" offset="746663">When the dividends were declared on the stock of this tightly owned corporation, if the dividends remained there that would be one thing in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.460" offset="793161">Instead of leaving all of them there, some were distributed, other dividends were used to purchase additional stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.253" offset="832345">The position it seems to me is untenable that the -- for example, suppose a dissident prior of course to his death had used the money to purchase some other stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.030" offset="887515">That would be one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.786" offset="894516">Suppose the dissident during his lifetime had transferred additional shares of his tightly owned corporation to the trust it would be almost unthinkable that you could draw a line between those two sets of stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.695" offset="970167">As a matter of fact, it appears so simple to me that the statute mean to what it says because if you will notice neither brief has any discussion of the legislative history and we were hard push to find legislative history on this exact point, it's just not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.766" offset="1050415">The earliest is back in the 19 -- the 69th Congress in the first session.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.610" offset="1081762">The old 1926 Act but it just mentions it, there's no argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.479" offset="1097331">I've -- the Government takes the position that all property means “all property” and you can't draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.757" offset="1130350">And finally, I would mention that the dispute between the -- the Sixth Circuit agrees with the Seventh Circuit and the First Circuit and the case which is cited in our brief at the Footnote -- on page 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.351" offset="1204746">The First Circuit went, although, it's under the later statute which is Section 20 -- 2036, the language is so practically identical with the first one.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.298" offset="1252603">And we submit that the First Circuit is correct that the Seventh Circuit is in error and we urged the Court to reverse the Seventh Circuit and make it clear that in construing Section 811, which is now 2036, it includes all the property and not to dividing between what was given 133 years ago and what exists at the time of dissident's death.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leon Fieldman</label>
            <text syncTime="383.571" offset="1637648">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.739" offset="1650291">I think it might be helpful if I review just for a moment or two some the salient facts with regard to these five trusts created by the taxpayer, but now deceased taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.915" offset="1695013">These trusts were created in December and January, December of 1936 and January of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.325" offset="1724688">Each of the trust was irrevocable.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.023" offset="1735450">The settlor did not have the right to alter, amend, revoke or terminate any of the trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.920" offset="1763035">The settlor did not reserve a life income interest in any of the trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.900" offset="1782993">The settlor was not a remainder man under any of the trusts and the settlor had no right of reversion under any of the trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.907" offset="1819042">The only right, the only narrow right that the settlor had here was a right which he could exercise along with two other trustees because he was one of the three trustees of each trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.715" offset="1870242">And that narrow right was this, that although each trust agreement specified that the trust income was to be paid to the trust beneficiary, the three trustees voting together could vote to retain a portion of the trust income and add it to the trust principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.615" offset="1941817">Once it became a portion of the trust principle, it was then distributed with the trust principle when the trust terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.165" offset="1975986">That was the only right that the settlor had and this was a right as one of three co-trustees.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="474.146" stopTime="477.750">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="474.146" offset="1999914">Was there a corresponding right to invade the corpus or not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leon_fieldman" startTime="477.750" stopTime="673.356">
            <label>Mr. Leon Fieldman</label>
            <text syncTime="477.750" offset="2014333">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.340" offset="2016737">There was, again, exercised all by all three co-trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.468" offset="2037217">Now when these trusts were first created, the settlor transferred to them shares of stock as the Solicitor General stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.225" offset="2072221">From that time on until the settlor's death, 13 years later, there were no further transfers by the settlor to the trustees of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.587" offset="2109733">During those 13 years of course, the trust earned income.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.412" offset="2129063">And approximately as the record shows, approximately 50% of the income over the years was either paid out to the trust beneficiaries or used to pay income tax payable by the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.554" offset="2177546">The remaining approximate 50% of the trust income was directed by the trustees to be added to trust principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.860" offset="2214849">Now, the taxpayer did concede below that this power to accumulate trust income which the settlor admittedly had in conjunction with his two co-trustees, did make the corpus, the original transferred corpus of the trust taxable in the taxpayer's estate on the theory that under Section 811 (c) he had the right to designate the persons who could possess or enjoy the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.168" offset="2340028">That is by paying out the income immediately, the trust beneficiaries got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.767" offset="2358418">If however the income was accumulated and added a trust principle, conceivably somebody other than the income beneficiary might get it because in some cases, the income beneficiary's death did not terminate the trust and the principle might therefore go to the income beneficiary's children or grandchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.731" offset="2434278">So we concede that this right to accumulate or to distribute income does make the principle taxable in the settlor's estate under Section 811 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="593.126" offset="2475865">The question here is, was the income earned by these irrevocable trusts during the 13 years between their creation and the settlor's death?</text>
            <text syncTime="603.478" offset="2517243">Was that income transferred by the settlor to the trusts and thus subject to taxation pursuant to the language of Section 811.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.542" offset="2561546">The taxpayer submits basically three points that under the statutory language that income is not taxable because it was not transferred by the settlor to the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.092" offset="2615777">Second, the doctrine of an incomplete transfer mentioned this morning by the Solicitor General has no application of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.174" offset="2648064">The transfers to the trust in 1936 and 1937 were complete when made.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.507" offset="2669380">Nothing more had to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.747" offset="2678366">The doctrine of an Incomplete Transfer as I will expound on later was first enunciated in cases which can have no application to the fact situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.060" offset="2723610">And thirdly, the decision below is correct and should be affirmed because an affirmance of the decision below does not create any tax in full of any kind large or small as the Government has argued both orally and in it's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.299" offset="2788603">Now, first is to the statutory language --</text>

            <text syncTime="675.524" offset="2805426">Would you mind restating your position with regard to the difference between the corpus and the income that it seems rather strange to me that where he had disposed irrevocably the corpus that it would be considered a part of his estate when he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.475" offset="2901243">But that the income from that over which he had some jurisdiction should be -- should not be considered a portion of his estate, I -- I didn't quite get your argument on that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leon Fieldman</label>
            <text syncTime="713.549" offset="2957563">The answer to that Mr. Chief Justice is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.705" offset="2970206">That under a decision of a Court of Appeals some years ago, it was held that if a settlor retains the right over property which he has transferred and in this case the property he has transferred must be the original corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.869" offset="3034885">If he retains the right to accumulate or distribute the income arising from that corpus then he has in effect retained a right over the corpus itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.527" offset="3081488">Since the income is the fruit of the corpus if he can designate those to possess or enjoy the fruit then he in effect has retained the power over the corpus which makes the corpus taxable in his estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.100" offset="3167796">That income is not taxable in his estate for this reason that the statute requires that what is to be taxed in the dissident's estate must have been transferred by the dissident.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.478" offset="3225266">And our position is that under any normal concept of property law, you cannot -- a settlor cannot transfer income which at the time it's earned by the trust within 13 years after his death belongs only to the trusts, is received only by them.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.625" offset="3537899">The statute has not one but two requirements for taxability.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.030" offset="3575515">The Government of course lays very heavy emphasis on the fact that the income falls within one requirement, that is if the settlor can designate those who are to possess or enjoy the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.412" offset="3620968">And that's the second requirement, the right to designate those who possess or enjoy and we can concede it.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.915" offset="3643016">The settlor does have that right and thus, the second requirement of the statute is met.The first however is not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.600" offset="3673736">And that first requirement stated very specifically by the statute is that the property to be taxed must have been transferred by the settlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.368" offset="3716890">And it's our position that the income was never transferred by the settlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.768" offset="3734444">He transferred only the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.947" offset="3743117">He could not transfer the income because it was never earned and perhaps never would have been earned at the time he transferred it.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.600" offset="3769762">In subsequent years when the income was earned, it became -- since these were irrevocable trusts which she could not alter, amend or revoke, that income become the property of the trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.374" offset="3820857">The settlor never owned that income and therefore he could never transfer it.</text>

            <text syncTime="951.332" offset="3908733">That in our position is no different than had trust income then put in a bank account.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.101" offset="3947813">Now, if both requirements of the statute are not met, if there is no transfer in the first instance then whatever is not transferred cannot be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.037" offset="3991489">And I think this simple example might serve to illustrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.562" offset="4005595">Assuming in this irrevocable trust the third party neither the beneficiary nor the settlor had decided to give a $100,000 to the trustee to add to the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.429" offset="4049063">This was permitted by the trust agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.074" offset="4059617">And this third party did give a $100,000 which was added to the principal of the trust and this $100,000 then proceeded to earn trust income.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.633" offset="4093889">Well as to this trust income, the settlor would have the same rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.758" offset="4110399">He could direct that it'd be paid out or it could direct that it be accumulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.380" offset="4128893">Thus, he had the right to designate the person's who would -- were to possess or enjoy the income from that $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.469" offset="4157210">Certainly, we would concede that but I don't think anybody would argue that the $100,000 is to be included in the settlor's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.599" offset="4189811">And the reason for that is that the first requirement of the statute was never met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.203" offset="4208201">That $100,000 was never transferred by the settlor to the trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.925" offset="4231084">And of course, the same principle applies as to the income earned by the trust not by the settlor after creation of the trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.596" offset="4269746">Now in addition to the fact that the statute clearly spills out these two requirements, only one of which has met as to the income, the statutory language also it appears indicates quite clearly that income was never meant to be taxed and there's two reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.285" offset="4340485">The first reason is this, the statute when talking about transfers by the settlor has an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.737" offset="4374340">It says, except in the case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in one-year money's worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.417" offset="4405060">Or if you try to apply that exception of this trust income earned during the 13 years after the irrevocable trust were created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.998" offset="4435362">He realized that it can have no meaning with regard to that trust income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.499" offset="4457409">That trust income was never subject to sale by the settlor either bona fide or otherwise for an adequate or for consideration because that income belonged to the trusts not to the settlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.437" offset="4509132">He could never have sold that and if the exception on the statute is to be read as having any meaning at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.947" offset="4543195">It must mean that what was transferred or what was subject to transfer by the settlor must have at one time been owned by the settlor and transferred by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.462" offset="4581230">If it was not owned by him, it could not be transferred by him and that's the case as to this income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.711" offset="4606203">That being so the exception is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.330" offset="4616652">The statute is cited at page 2 of the taxpayer's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.750" offset="4638386">The second statutory support for the taxpayer's position is also to be found on this few sentences of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.233" offset="4692302">Remembering that the statute has two requirements; one, that there be a transfer by the settlor; and two, that the settlor have the right to designate those who shall possess or enjoy the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.398" offset="4744965">And then reading the statute you'll find that when the word transfer is used in the third line of the statute as cited on page 2 of the taxpayer's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.374" offset="4788851">The word property was used, “transferred property spoken of.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.446" offset="4805151">There is no reference to income when there's a talk about transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.195" offset="4824168">But when the second requirement of the statute is dealt with, on the very last line of the cited statute that is where the settlor is said to have the power to designate those who shall possess or enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.404" offset="4884982">At that point, the statute says the property or the income there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.587" offset="4905671">There's no reference to the income in the transferring section of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.416" offset="4925001">And the reason for that I think is very simple that it was not the conversion or intention to consider income which might never be earned at the time a settlor creates an irrevocable transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.711" offset="4974216">They considered that income as having been transferred by the settlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.188" offset="4992084">The property can be transferred, yes, but the income when it is earned and in an irrevocable trust is not the settlor's to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.458" offset="5033253">Now, the second reason why we feel that the Seventh Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit in the Burns case, there are three circuits in effect which have held these are correct and why the decision below should be affirmed as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.187" offset="5100126">And this is in the sense of a negative reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.367" offset="5112874">The Government argues that this transfer when made to the trust 13 years before the settlor's death was not a complete transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.154" offset="5147982">It became complete only when he died because he retained this right over the property and if it became complete only then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.044" offset="5179538">Then all of the income which was added to the trust during these 13 years also remained the settlor's until his death and therefore was transferred when he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.673" offset="5222066">This doctrine of an incomplete transfer has arisen primarily in three cases decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.274" offset="5256443">One was the Church and these cases are cited on both grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.356" offset="5268773">One was the Church estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.509" offset="5277445">There this Court said that the transfer by the settlor to an irrevocable trust was incomplete, it did not become complete until he died and I concede that so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.519" offset="5317465">In the Church estate however, Mr. Church retained for his life the right to receive the income from the trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.557" offset="5349648">So, obviously as a matter of economics he had given away nothing of value to the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.679" offset="5370128">He retained all the benefit of the trust during his lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.165" offset="5384025">And I think it's quite logical therefore to say that those transfers to the trust became complete only when Mr. Church died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.205" offset="5412237">But remember here that this is a trust in which the settlor has retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.854" offset="5430836">No income interest at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.509" offset="5441390">The second case which announces this incomplete doctrine is the Rainey case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.295" offset="5472528">There are two this Court said that the transfer was incomplete until the settlor's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.821" offset="5490604">But there the settlor retained the right to terminate the trust at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.316" offset="5516622">There's no such right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.836" offset="5522683">This trust cannot be altered, amended or revoked, or terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.449" offset="5541177">And the third case was the Holmes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.217" offset="5560195">There too, there was a right of termination which does not exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.060" offset="5575659">This transfer to the trust was as complete as it was possible to make it in 1936 or 1937.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.354" offset="5964779">The loophole which the Government suggests is this, that a clever taxpayer taking advantage of this case might create an irrevocable trust of this type, transferred to at his stock and a closely held corporation, have dividends paid to the trust, have the trustees accumulate that trust income and the trust, and then when the taxpayer dies none of the accumulated income will be subject to federal estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.840" offset="6070732">Well, if he hadn't been this clever and let the income accumulate in his corporation the value of his stock at the time of his death would reflect that accumulated income and therefore in effect, the accumulated income would be taxed in his estate, that is (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.650" offset="6133948">And this says the Government, there's a loophole which must be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.264" offset="6148472">But of course the taxpayer who looks -- protects loopholes, is not interested in saving federal estate tax at the expense which he pay now just as much if not more federal income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.525" offset="6197478">And that is precisely what might happen if this loophole were availed of by a taxpayer who I think must be a very unclever tax payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.968" offset="6243244">If the corporate income is paid out as dividends to an irrevocable trust, that irrevocable trust must pay income tax on those dividends as taxpayer just like any other single, unmarried taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.031" offset="6307506">Well, if those corporate dividends are not declared but are retained on the corporation, there is no income tax under the normal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.831" offset="6338748">So while it's true that the estate tax conceivably maybe avoided by the estate, income tax must necessarily be incurred and the income tax, of course, is paid during one's lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.590" offset="6393710">The federal estate tax only after one is dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.635" offset="6405935">Income tax rates of course are quite high and it seems to me that to say that this decision below has kind of open the way for tax avoidance is to be highly unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.908" offset="6450970">I just don't see that any taxpayer would want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.541" offset="6469569">So for each of these three reasons, we submit that the decision below is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.484" offset="6485347">The statutory language has two requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.938" offset="6495169">One of them is that there must be a transfer by the settlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.630" offset="6513873">The income here was not transferred by the settlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.039" offset="6531532">The second is that the doctrine of an incomplete transfer has no bearing upon this case because this is an irrevocable trust which cannot be altered, amended or revoked and the settlor has retained no income interest, no remainder interest and no reversion of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.984" offset="6599346">And thirdly, affirmance of the decision below will not open or enlarge any tax in the form of any nature.</text>
