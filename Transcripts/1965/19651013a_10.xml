            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="97.182" offset="492126">Its -- the one point is the preemption and he flatly disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.967" offset="515218">In the present case is an action filed in the District Court in the western district of Texas by the United States of America on behalf of small business administration seeking to recover balance due on a promissory note executed by one Delbert Yazell doing business as Yazell's Little Lake agent and Ethel Mae Yazell.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.530" offset="613543">The amount involved was $47,019.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.183" offset="632142">A copy of the note was attached and there was also a modification of the note attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.877" offset="658892">Immediately thereafter the defendant Ethel Mae Yazell filed a motion for summary judgment asserting that no action could lie against their separate estate and this was accompanied by an affidavit asserting her covertures.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.558" offset="721586">And that the defendant's original answer after Yazell again asserted her coverture and dealt with -- Yazell pleaded a whole lot of set off claims etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.659" offset="769964">Now the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment was granted against Delbert but except as to the set off point and the defense of coverture of Ethel Yazell was deferred for briefing, etcetera and finally in the opinion by Judge Hutcheson, summary judgment was given for Ethel Mae Yazell.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.673" offset="874036">And the -- in his opinion Judge Hutcheson was very plain to the point and he pointed out that the sole issue was whether the law of Texas where the contract was made that married women is protected by coverage of a personal liability under contract is controlling here or whether since the transaction was a transaction with the Federal Government, the Texas law of coverture was nullified and abrogated and then he specifically held no and he disagreed with the case of United States versus Helz in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.895" offset="1026905">On the other hand Judge Prettyman sitting by assignment relying on the Clearfield Trust case held that it is opinioned along from the Federal Government as a federal manner and should be governed by a federal law and not the state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.047" offset="1095555">The case itself is by no means difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.861" offset="1110810">In the first place there's no question with the facts and the only question is as to how far federal agency or the Federal Government is bound by local state procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.994" offset="1163368">The first part of our brief we set out that federal law alone controls in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.836" offset="1186670">I don't believe there's any question about it and that is so unless Congress provides to the contrary like in the Federal Tort Claims Act or one of those types of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.051" offset="1239542">But here, there's no question that federal law governs, indeed the respondent agrees that federal law governs the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.705" offset="1278203">The respondent also insists that the State of Texas has no interest at all in this matter and he says that the Texas statutes are not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.919" offset="1315088">It's just the Texas property rules that's concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.047" offset="1335568">On the other hand when you take the Clearfield case and U.S. against Standard Oil, we find that in the absence of an applicable act of Congress, the Federal Courts must fashion the governing rule of law according to their own standards, the federal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.736" offset="1410278">And in fashioning this rule of law would be applied due consideration must be give to cases where the Government's purse is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.370" offset="1444864">And the Federal Courts may adopt state law of course in fashioning their own as they did in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.811" offset="1470568">For example the Bozeman case and there are several other cases relied on by the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.230" offset="1508289">However, we must bear in mind especially with small business administration that it is not a separate governmental corporation rather it's an integral part of the United States Government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.675" offset="1570043">As for example the Farm Credit Administration about which this Court held as the Farm Credit Administration, there's not an unincorporated agency of the United States Government administrative and lending funds, its lending funds appropriated by Congress of the United States Treasury and returning the money to the Treasury upon repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.493" offset="1661367">In short, it is an integral part of the Government mechanism itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.823" offset="1682683">Now the cases where you'll find the Court agreeing to the state laws recording instruments etcetera and even indeed on the question of priority of liens and all such actions, one or two cases the Court is going so far as to say we do this because in doing so we're following the law of all of the states or we're doing it because the majority of the states have the same rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.599" offset="1809742">But in this case as we point out in our brief, there are only at best we can find 11 states that still have some vestige of married woman disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.219" offset="1860211">On the other hand the other states have the regular law that everybody follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.636" offset="1885915">This Court has taken note of the fact that covertures about is archaic as any rule still remaining around in the law.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="453.960" offset="1919248">General, supposing a state passed a law that says that they didn't -- would not permit any of its citizens to take small loans on a business -- loans into the small business administration, would the United States have to respect that law?</text>

            <text syncTime="475.577" offset="2005661">It seems to me that on the question of this governmental function of distributing funds and lending funds out, I don't believe that the state could interfere with right of the United States citizen to obtain aid from its Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.117" offset="2075878">The Sovereignty Clause would be gone then it seems me, Article 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.602" offset="2101791">And the -- it start -- it seems to me that when you realize on the other hand that in Texas alone as we pointed out in our brief as of the end of 63 there were $46 million in business loans and 15 million in disaster loans outstanding and then we outlined a lot of money in the other 11 states that have this.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.039" offset="2187577">Certainly this is the place where we want a uniform rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.059" offset="2203564">We don't want a rule that will apply to one group of married women in one state and a group of married women in another state to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.986" offset="2235329">The congressional purpose of cost with aid and assist people but as pointed out in our brief they are required to get as much security as can be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.303" offset="2288619">I believe that the cases if I may for a moment get to the respondent's position which I think of course deserves great attention but the main thrust is that since Congress gave small business the right to make rules and small business in one obvious rules involving warehousing of the assets provides that they shall be put in a bonded warehouse unless the state law protects the lien otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.937" offset="2439084">As I understand the respondent position as said by putting that one provision and one regulation they adopted all of the state laws of all of the 50 states rather than 48 when the law is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.655" offset="2493942">This is of course not true and in every case where this Court has so -- made the federal claim subject to state rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.605" offset="2537827">It has been to get uniformity, not to destroy uniformity and I think that's the difference between those cases in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.633" offset="3249925">I would say that I occupy a rather curious position in this case because I stand here and say that small business administration and its predecessor, Reconstruction Finance Corporation has performed and is performing one of the great services to the citizens in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.456" offset="3353161">And so in a sense I stand here defending the methods of business employed by those two agencies in their lending functions to private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.402" offset="3412929">They've done a good job and they've done that good job upon the sole basis of utilizing as a ready made vehicle to property laws of the several states in which they operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.361" offset="3468831">First, the one simple question in this case is whether the United States was entitled to a personal judgment against this mad woman who had been sued jointly with her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.885" offset="3530898">The District Court Judge Ben Rice ruled that personal liability against the married woman did not lie basing it upon a community property rule as it affects the married woman and her obligations or a lack of obligation in joining with the husband in executing community debts where a community property only is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.146" offset="3652002">That judgment was affirmed in the Circuit Court with a divided or a dissenting opinion by Judge Prettyman.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.867" offset="3690872">Now, coverture as such as I see it is not important in this case and certainly not to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.519" offset="3729429">If there's any federal law on quote (Inaudible) I don't know where it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.626" offset="3749909">I think that the one thing that should be said here is that conseq -- grave consequences can result easily from a failure to grasp the importance of the lending agencies not just this one, the Farmers Home Administration and the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.284" offset="3876551">In the state of the federal law they've got to use the local property laws and each of the states where they're doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.233" offset="3908315">If they fail to do that then you have this curious position.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.069" offset="3935692">Reconstruction Finance Corporation I believe is created somewhere about 1930 and it operated until the Small Business Act of 1953 when the succession was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.879" offset="3998908">And none of this legislation did the Congress provide a set of property laws for the federal administrators to use in discharging the public policy placed upon them by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.709" offset="4074245">In some other cases the omission to provide those property laws for their operation has been persuasive I think that was true in the Kramer case by the Eight Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.128" offset="4135894">So, to get right along with it, there are two things that I would submit in behalf of the respondent in this case which I believe are worthy of profound consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.333" offset="4180720">One is that in the legislation creating small business administration the Congress adopted directly and indirectly and I repeat this, the Congress did adopt local property rules to be used by the small business administration as appropriate federal rules governing the validity of the security instruments to be taken by -- I said appropriate federal rule because there is not in this case any conflict between the laws of the State of Texas and the authority of the Federal Government in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.010" offset="4343411">There is no conflict if there is then the federal authority prevails without any question but this Court has always recognized that the Congress has the right to adopt state laws or to absorb them as it were to borrow a phrase from one of the cases and use those local property laws in the discharge of the federal function which is the lending of money to private enterprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.053" offset="4635564">I don't think the state would have any standing to question that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.927" offset="4651029">On the other hand if the Congress does not place any limitation by definition or otherwise upon who is or is not legally capable of contracting but just have -- it says that you can lend money and take note some security instruments for it and not another word, then I think you must look somewhere to determine who is legally capable of contracting.</text>
