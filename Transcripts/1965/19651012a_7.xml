            <label>Mr. John H. Hanninen</label>
            <text syncTime="21.612" offset="189837">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.743" offset="202376">The primary question involved in this case is whether the State Courts of Wisconsin can apply state law to regulate primary recognition picketing of marine engineers on petitioner's vessels after the National Labor Relations Board has initially determined that such engineers are supervisors within the meaning of the Federal National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.922" offset="335078">The General Counsel of the Board has determined that the regulatory scheme of the Act cannot be applied due to the supervisory status of the engineers and state law also prohibits this type of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.693" offset="422118">Petitioner operates vessels on the Great Lakes, actually there are four companies who operate these vessels as an integrated fleet, with one of the petitioners, the Hanna Mining Company designated as the operating agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.521" offset="493484">These ships transport cargos between various Great Lake's ports including American and Canadian ports and they are engaged in commerce within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.858" offset="554820">On these vessels, the petitioners employed marine engineers licensed by the Coast Guard who operate the engines and keep them in repair and also supervise the work of unlicensed seamen in their department.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.363" offset="628799">The unlicensed seamen are represented in a bargaining unit which extends over all of these vessels by the United Steel Workers of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.444" offset="681148">The petitioners had a labor agreement with the respondent MEBA covering the wages and working conditions of the engineers which expired on July 15th of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.123" offset="743842">Negotiations were in progress for a new labor agreement in August of that year when virtually all of the marine engineers notified the petitioners in writing that they no longer desire to be represented by the MEBA for purposes of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.577" offset="825657">When this occurred, the petitioners immediately informed the MEBA and took the position that further collective bargaining should be suspended until the MEBA could by means of a secret ballot election conducted by an impartial third party demonstrated that they actually represented a majority of the engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.966" offset="923251">The MEBA declined and refused to agree to any election and had demanded that the petitioners resume collective bargaining and negotiate a labor contract which the petitioners refused to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.984" offset="983333">On September 12 of that year, 1962 the MEBA commenced picketing petitioner's vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.144" offset="1007992">The picketing commenced at the port of Duluth in Minnesota where one of petitioner's vessels was unloading a cargo of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.785" offset="1042474">The MEBA pickets appeared on the scene with signs stating that the Hanna Mining Company, the operating agent for these vessels, was unfair, refuses to negotiate the contract, District 2, MEBA no dispute with other employer appended to the picket sign and the special receptacle for that purpose was a card with the name of the petitioner's vessels, the Joseph H. Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.417" offset="1156995">As a result of the picketing, the coal dock workers refused to unload the cargo from the steamer Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.633" offset="1181863">The picketing was commenced on that same day at the oil loading docks of the Great Northern Railway Company at Superior, Wisconsin about six miles away from the coal dock where the petitioner's vessels regularly load cargos who buy an ore.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.843" offset="1246751">The picketing also commenced in various other Great Lake's ports including Detroit, Cleveland, Ashtabula, and Buffalo with the same type of signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.144" offset="1303907">None of the engineers responded to the picketing, they all continued working.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.509" offset="1329403">The unlicensed seamen aboard petitioner's vessels also ignored this picketing and continued working steadily as did the other offices on this vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.580" offset="1381648">Nevertheless, tug crews refused to render towing services to petitioner's vessels because of the picketing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.594" offset="1413726">The coal dock workers persisted in a refusal to unload the cargo from petitioner's vessels at the coal dock in Duluth.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.338" offset="1444760">There were some short and minor work stoppages among the oil loading crews of the Great Northern Railway Company in Superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.237" offset="1484361">On September 12th, the date of the picketing started in 1962, petitioners filed an election petition with the Regional Director for the National Labor Relations Board in Cleveland requesting the Board to conduct a representation election to determine whether or not the MEBA in fact represented a majority of the engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.851" offset="1566804">The Regional Director dismissed the petition upon a finding that the engineers were supervisors and excluded from the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.947" offset="1603166">The ruling was appealed to the NLRB itself and was affirmed upon the same ground.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Hanninen</label>
            <text syncTime="385.949" offset="1647156">The election petition was dismissed administratively after investigation by the Regional Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.070" offset="1671607">He did not hold the hearing and neither did the Board itself although, in connection with the election petition, the petitioners did request the Board to hold a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.772" offset="1718418">However, the Board's dismissal stated that there was no unit appropriate for collective bargaining because the engineers were supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.860" offset="1766797">And petitioners about three days after the picketing commenced at Duluth filed a -- an unfair labor practice charge with the Regional Director of the Board at Minneapolis which has jurisdiction over the ports of Superior and Duluth.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.887" offset="1834924">The charge claimed the violation of Section 8 (b) (4) of the Act which prohibits secondary boycott activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.064" offset="1867630">Regional Director and the staff at Minneapolis commenced an investigation of the picketing activities and other activities of the MEBA and attorney signed -- assigned to the case took witness statements at Duluth and also at Superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.152" offset="1935966">The petitioners applied information regarding the activities of the MEBA at Duluth, Superior, and Cleveland to the Regional Director for the Board at Minneapolis and supplemented that information with witness affidavits in connection with the activities of the MEBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.543" offset="2029589">After the investigation was concluded by the Regional Director at Minneapolis, he dismissed the charge stating that there was no indication of any secondary boycott activity which would violate the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.841" offset="2082774">This ruling was also appealed --</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Hanninen</label>
            <text syncTime="500.105" offset="2103777">It was on the basis that the picketing was primary and not secondary that it conformed to the Board's standards in a Moore Dry Dock case for common situs picketing and therefore could be regarded as no more than primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.316" offset="2156648">This ruling by the Minneapolis Region was also appealed to the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board and after consideration the National Labor Relations Board's General Counsel administratively affirmed the dismissal of the charge on the ground that the investigation is closed that the picketing was merely primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.250" offset="2248391">It didn't violate the Board's common situs rules and requirements and that the MEBA activity at other locations or other sites did not evidence any unlawful objective within the meaning of the Section of the Act nor it did the totality of the MEBA's conduct indicate an unlawful objective within the meaning of that Section of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.980" offset="2355284">Petitioners also filed a charge with the Board's Regional Director at Cleveland claiming that Section 8 (b) (7) of the federal Act had been violated which regulates recognition and organizational picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.409" offset="2424978">This charge after investigation by the Regional Director of Cleveland was also dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.668" offset="2446085">In his dismissal, the -- it was dismissed by a letter and a letter -- the gist of it was that there was insufficient evidence of picketing or they tried to picket which violated Section 8 (b) (7) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.763" offset="2502405">This ruling was appealed to the NLRB's General Counsel in Washington and the dismissal was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.462" offset="2537200">The General Counsel stated in the initial letter of dismissal that there was no evidence of any picketing which violated Section 8 (b) (7) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.427" offset="2581086">Particularly in view of the fact that the Board in a concurrent holding had held that the engineers were supervisors excluded from the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.710" offset="2618180">In response to petitioner's request for clarifications, the General Counsel issued another letter on December 21st of 1962 in which he stated that his conclusion was predicated solely upon the supervisory status of the marine engineers which precluded any application of Section 8 (b) (7) of the Act and that what the posture of the case would've been had the engineers and employees within the meaning of the Act had not been considered and that this procedure was in accordance with the established practice of his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.003" offset="2775333">Great Lakes navigation is seasonal and usually extends from the middle of April until the end of November.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.065" offset="2811591">At the end of November of 1962 before the final rulings were obtained from the General Counsel, petitioner's ships were withdrawn from operation, laid up, the crews went home and the MEBA stopped picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.514" offset="2873448">In April of the following year of 1963, petitioners again placed their vessels in to operation and the MEBA resumed its picketing at Superior, Wisconsin using the same signs, the same pickets appeared, and they stood at the same place at the gates to the oil loading docks of the Great Northern Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.958" offset="2963205">There was no change whatsoever in the picketing at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.338" offset="3000717">In as much as the law of Wisconsin forbids recognition and organizational picketing of this kind, petitioners filed a complaint with the Circuit Court of the State of Wisconsin, at Superior, Wisconsin, seeking injunctive relief against the continued -- continuation of the picketing alleging that it was a resumption of the same picketing upon which the NLRB had passed and its General Counsel had ruled setting forth the initial determinations obtained from the Board and the General Counsel with respect to the supervisory status of the engineers and the inapplicability of Section 8 (b) (7) of the Act together with the ruling that there had been no evidence of secondary boycott activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.560" offset="3217638">Injunctive relief against the picketing was granted in the form of a temporary restraining order by the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.460" offset="3249194">The MEBA appeared specially and moved to dismiss upon a ground that the state court lack jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.633" offset="3281899">Ultimately, the state court did dismiss the action and vacated the restraining order upon the ground that the petitioner's complaint even though amended to clarify the pleadings continued to arguably allege secondary boycott activity that the action of the National Labor Relations Board since this Court decided the case of MEBA versus Interlake Steamship Company had not been so definite and certain as to give state court's jurisdiction in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.920" offset="3403003">Petitioners affirmed -- appealed in the matter to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin and that Supreme Court of Wisconsin affirmed it Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.431" offset="3449083">Noting that the picketing as alleged was illegal under Wisconsin law and probably not protected by the federal law in as much as the engineers were supervisors the Supreme Court of Wisconsin took the position that General Counsel's rulings cannot be given the final legal significance that Board rulings are given within the meaning of this Court's decision in San Diego Unions versus Garmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.456" offset="3577187">And since the picketing approach being unlawful under federal law as a secondary boycott, the state courts must refuse to enjoin them.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.450" offset="3621177">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin indicated that it realized that this result was somewhat of the paradox.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.987" offset="3651271">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin also said that the arguability of certain issues as being subject to the National Labor Relations Board continued despite the determinations that were obtained by the petitioners from the General Counsel and the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.314" offset="3728593">We believe that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.285" offset="3748551">The General Counsel specifically empowered by the federal Act to have final authority, on behalf of the Board in respect of unfair labor practice charges, the investigation of them, and the issuance of complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.770" offset="3818454">Until the General Counsel for the Board issues a complaint, the case never reaches the Board itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.347" offset="3852727">In the ordinary case, a refusal by the General Counsel to issue a complaint does not as was noted in the Garmon case leave the issue with unclouded legal significance for the applicability of the Act to the personnel now involved and to the activity maybe clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.488" offset="3933288">The charge is merely dismissed because of a lack of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.474" offset="3953246">However in the special circumstances of this case, the General Counsel's rulings coupled with that of the Board itself that the engineers were supervisors does have final legal significance because the General Counsel's ruling meant explicitly that Section 8 (b) (7) of the Act which regulates primary recognition picketing where employees are involved cannot be applied because in essential element for that section of the Act to apply is the presence of employees and the engineers were supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.474" offset="4097233">Consequently, this ruling by the General Counsel did have final legal significance in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.533" offset="4129520">It said that the Board could never reach the primary recognition picketing of supervisors under the Act because the Act did not apply to such activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.070" offset="4175600">A possibility of secondary boycott activity should not deprive the state court of jurisdiction over the primary activity in the case of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.339" offset="4240697">Secondary activity which is left to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board is something more than primary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.545" offset="4277582">It amounts to activity which is calculated to urge neutral employees of secondary employers to cease working for their employer in an effort to put pressure on the primary employer and this of course is something more than primary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.172" offset="4368071">The two activities can exist simultaneously but they're separable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.277" offset="4392521">Consequently, the primary picketing could be left in the case of recognition picketing of supervisors to the jurisdiction of the state court and the secondary activity could remain within the jurisdiction of the Board to be regulated if there is any such activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.990" offset="4483323">It would not advance the policies of the Act to deny the state court's jurisdiction of the primary recognition picketing for the Act does not extend to such activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.965" offset="4535254">The National Labor Relations Board perceives no encroachment upon its jurisdiction if this course were followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.161" offset="4572035">A parallel situation arises in the primary picketing of foreign vessels usually ship picketing occurs at a common situs when the ship is tied up to a dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.284" offset="4612472">The common situs includes many employers other than the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.698" offset="4638177">By the decision of this Court in the Incres case, it was held that the National Labor Relations Act is not applicable to foreign ships and their crews.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.044" offset="4679555">Consequently, state courts have commenced regulating the primary picketing of such foreign vessels and the Courts of Wisconsin have also done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.649" offset="4721977">In the meanwhile, it is arguable that there might be secondary boycott activity connected with the picketing of such foreign vessels and if such activity exist then arguably, at least, it would be but within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board because even though the shipowner may not be subject to the Act there maybe many other employers within that common situs who are subject to the Act and who maybe affected and anyone affected by the secondary boycott activity would give the Board and its General Counsel the right to take action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.694" offset="4894177">Since state jurisdiction in the foreign ship picketing cases does exist side by side with arguable NLRB jurisdiction, the causes of action have as a practical matter have been shown to be separable and can be acted upon by the state and the National Labor Relations Board as the case maybe without infringing upon the jurisdiction of each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.184" offset="5008071">There is nothing in the history or the policies of the National Labor Relations Act which suggest that Congress intended to prohibit the states from regulating recognition picketing involving supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.841" offset="5070764">In the 1947 amendments to the federal Act, the supervisors were removed from its coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.137" offset="5103888">The reason for excluding supervisors was that Congress considered it anomalous to require an employer to bargain with the front line of his own management that there could be dual loyalty, a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.299" offset="5160521">And for that reason, Congress removed supervisors from the Act and to make it plain that no employer should be required to bargain with the union representing such supervisors and in Section 14 (a) to the Act which provided that such bargaining shall not be compelled by any national or local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.032" offset="5275460">Efforts to organize supervisors are not protected by means of the federal Act because Section 7 of the Act which confers such protection applies only to employees and thereby supervisors are excluded by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.552" offset="5365530">Similarly, Section 8 (b) (7) of the federal Act which regulates recognition and organizational picketing applies only to employees due to the general exclusion of employers from the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.169" offset="5444002">In Wisconsin and other states, there would now be parallel remedies under federal state and -- under federal and state law for the regulation of recognition picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.531" offset="5501471">Section 8 (b) (7) of the federal Act regulate such picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.035" offset="5515473">The Wisconsin law under the Vogt case also regulates such picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.274" offset="5536475">Consequently, there is no repugnancy between the state and the federal law in this area and there would be no reason for prohibiting the states from regulating recognition picketing as a matter of policy, federal policy where the states have jurisdiction of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.999" offset="5631352">In the legislative history of Section 8 (b) (7) of the federal Act, it appears that Congress considered the technique of recognition picketing as alien to the policies of the Act which sought to provide a free determination of their bargaining agent to employees within the Act, consequently, Section 8 (b) (7) was enacted to forbid or regulate such picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.964" offset="5735215">State law has also based upon the same considerations in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.862" offset="5754859">The Wisconsin law is founded upon the public policy that it would be unfair to permit recognition picketing which would compel an employer to coerce his employees in a choice of a bargaining agent or otherwise pays economic lost or economic run perhaps in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.244" offset="5860394">This type of picketing has not been left to the free interplay of economic forces because it is against public policy as coercive and unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.056" offset="5903548">Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that Section 14 (a) of the Act which relieves the employer of compulsion to bargain with supervisors provides any protection for this type of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.705" offset="5978154">The stated purpose of Section 14 (a) was to relieve the employer of the duty to bargain with supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.322" offset="6004694">It does not in anyway preclude a state from protecting an employer against organizational recognition picketing where supervisors are involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.348" offset="13876746">I say -- I pause briefly to comment on the issue as to whether or not Congress has actually left the regulation of organization or recognition activity of supervisors to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.377" offset="13940903">We submit that a fair reading and interpretation of the Act whereby supervisors have been excluded from the term employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.746" offset="13978311">But in light of Section 14 (a), Congress designedly established a national policy pursuant to which policy supervisors were not to be left open for regulation by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.252" offset="14036407">Now, what the Government suggests is the mere exclusion of supervisors from the definition employees certainly signifies Congress' intent that supervisors be left to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.321" offset="14084681">But the Government fails to give heed to Section 14 (a) under which supervisors are given the right to join and become members of unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.979" offset="14131284">The only limitation on Section 14 (a) is that there maybe no state or federal law which would compel an employer to recognize a union representing supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.961" offset="14183215">It is our unders -- interpretation as we read the Act in light of the amendment to Section 7 or the amendment on the definition and Section 14 (a) that what Congress did is to decide that a nice balance between employers and supervisors in terms of their relative economic forces was to leave the regulation of their activities to the free play of economic forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.842" offset="14302751">I honestly and voluntary believe that if the question have been asked on the floor of Congress, what is the intent of Section 14 (a) at the time it was passed, at the time that supervisors were omitted from the definition of the term employees the idea of Congress was that employers and supervisors could take care of their own problems and that let it to be free -- to the free play of economic forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.127" offset="14407868">Certainly, if you read the reports of the House and the Senate on the issue of 14 (a), it's made clear that Congress intended to establish a National Labor policy for supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.946" offset="14463143">Not a policy such as we have for employees of what is prohibited and what is permitted but nevertheless a National Labor policy which is in effect that is left free as distinguished from any state being able to attach jurisdiction over the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.752" offset="14554363">May I point out Your Honor lastly that when Congress intended to see jurisdiction over any group of employees or any area of conduct or activity, Congress had no difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.910" offset="14603055">And so legislative namely, when they enacted 14 (b) and they enacted 14 (c) Congress knew exactly how to incorporate a specific provision that would permit the states to have jurisdiction over a specific area of conduct that Congress wished to give to the states.</text>
