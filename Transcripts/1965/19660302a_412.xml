            <label>Mr. Albert J. Krieger</label>
            <text syncTime="21.152" offset="187956">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.476" offset="213243">Sometime ago, some members of this Court had the opportunity to state and did state that confinement in prison for a period such as two years or 18 months or three years without the intervening process of indictment and trial by jury in a criminal contempt case would corrode our civil liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.843" offset="346781">I believe that that was stated some six years ago and on one instance some seven years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.648" offset="381994">I believe that the situation about which these members of the Court warned has come to pass finally.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.262" offset="424417">Salvatore Shillitani was brought before a grand jury in the Southern District of New York -- asked certain questions, invoked his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, eventually he was granted immunity and persisted in his refusal to testify, once again invoking his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.251" offset="512397">He was directed by one judge, Judge Wyatt to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.639" offset="533922">He failed to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.048" offset="543535">Subsequently, a hearing was held before Judge MacMahon and that the conclusion of the hearing Judge MacMahon sentenced Shillitani to two years in prison and added thereto a rather strange what we can term “purge clause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="133.530" offset="637471">Shillitani was remanded without bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.320" offset="652622">Application was made before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for bail, bail was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.656" offset="681984">He had been remanded on August 10th of 1964, argument before the Court of Appeals was held in November of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.271" offset="712495">This Court granted certiorari to certain questions in Harris in December of 1964, and finally, in January of 1965, after Shillitani had served some five months, he was finally admitted to bail, very substantial bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.527" offset="793475">One of the great problems in his being admitted to bail was that he could not be released until there had been considerable supplication and genuflection and pleading with the Parole Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.925" offset="843107">The Federal Parole Commission had lodged a warrant in Shillitani in the intervening period because in their estimate of the situation, he had been convicted of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.212" offset="888247">He had a criminal conviction and therefore he had violated his parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.695" offset="922102">The two questions upon which this Court granted certiorari, the add mixture of civil and criminal contempt and whether Shillitani had a right to indictment and trial by jury cannot be discussed completely, separately, and apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.973" offset="987303">They do interlock -- they do interdigitary.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.146" offset="999946">And the reason they do this is because our very recent history has shown us the development of a new type of prosecution, something which has not existed in our past.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.076" offset="1071626">This Court had the opportunity on April 7th of 1964 to state that its research had shown that there were approximately six cases since 1957 in which a sentence of one year or more had been imposed in a criminal contempt case, and that prior to 1957, there were only two.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.183" offset="1184057">Since April 7th of 1964, in the Second Circuit alone there had been four cases with sentences of two years or one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.264" offset="1252394">The real problem posed here is not whether there should be a machinery for obtaining testimonial compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.703" offset="1290219">No one can quarrel that there must be some way to obtain testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.878" offset="1322924">The problem seems to rotate around whether there can be imprisonment for as long as two years or if the judge feels otherwise for considerably longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.115" offset="1375796">For at least as far as Shillitani is concerned, for four times the sentence -- the maximum sentence for a petty offense without the intervening safeguards of indictment and trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.105" offset="1431803">The results may well be the same after these safeguards have been applied but that is no reason why the safeguards should not be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.310" offset="1484570">The Solicitor General, states basically five reasons why the Government does not like jury trials in cases of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.483" offset="1533262">And of course it appears that if a jury trial is good enough, is appropriate -- is a properly appropriate procedure in cases involving murderers, in cases involving spies, in cases involving any and every horrendous crime, it's certainly is an appropriate procedure and can do the right thing in imposing, if need be, a punishment for a failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.606" offset="1653844">There is no greater risk to be run by the Government or by the court in nullification of its order by the interposition of the jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.876" offset="1710895">The court of necessity when there has been a refusal to testify must vindicate its authority and integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.260" offset="1748407">No one can quarrel with that proposition either.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.478" offset="1761259">The question is, once again, how?</text>
            <text syncTime="418.446" offset="1777142">Now we must differentiate between a refusal to testify in a situation such as occurs when a person appears before a grand jury and the situation which might have occur from the stubborn, obdurate attitude immediately before the court by a witness before and during the course of the trial or the classic situation of some kind of misbehavior before the court which require quick and summary disposition by the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.918" offset="8251016">Now, Justice Harlan in the Green case stated very noble words, very good words that they will examine a criminal contempt sentence to see in words to this effect if it's reasonable, and that they as appellate courts reserved the right to reduce the sentence if it turns out to be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.719" offset="8350281">I might say the minority opinion prophetically stated that the word reasonable standard is irrepressible, vague, and delusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.831" offset="8406706">Now, I wouldn't be arguing before this Court that this was an unreasonable sentence if when he was asked these questions, mind you, it was -- it came in -- in fact, on page 174 (a), it's brought before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.815" offset="8490611">This case seeks for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.293" offset="8508583">And the Assistant District Attorney says to him on page 174 (a), "So that you'll have a better appreciation of the purpose of this grand jury proceeding, I want to advice you that there's been testimony before a Senate Committee and statements have been made to federal law enforcement agencies that a person named Thomas Lucchese is at the head of a group, the people that are engaged on a number of illegal activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.987" offset="8703352">Now, petitioner answered as follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="2169.288" offset="8780570">Now, I'm going to skip -- and then he went on answering all other questions such as that he never discussed how they were going to handle grand jury proceedings with Lucchese or with anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.527" offset="8821530">On page 214 of the record, “Mr. Pappadio, I'm going to ask you some of the questions that Judge Harlan directed you to answer on the time you were before and prior to the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.616" offset="8877850">At the narcotics trial of Vito Genovese there was testimony, there was testimony that you attended the meeting at the home of Rocco Mazzie.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.599" offset="8921736">Now, as I say, do you think -- do you think that I would be arguing here, if he had said I refuse to answer, that this is an unreasonable sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.356" offset="8972831">Mind you, I'm coming back to what Justice Harlan stated in the Green case majority that appellate courts will review, and therefore we haven't had a review in the Court of Appeals, you're just -- the judge in Levine said the sentence is too much for that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.641" offset="9061961">He said a year would have been enough, and he suggested when a man comes under indictment -- under indictment and answers those questions, 125 out of 130 -- but more startling, more startling is this, on page 42 of the record, I said to the judge, the trial judge when the case started because the indictment was hanging over his head and words don't wash away the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.277" offset="9192469">It's true the Court of Appeals and the trial judge says, “Don't worry about the indictment, I mean they can use anything against you,” but of course as the -- these particular immunity statutes have been interpreted, you don't get immunity from prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.003" offset="9263417">You only get immunity from use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.621" offset="9273866">And under those circumstances, he had something to worry about and don't forget these questions have nothing to do, “Are you doing anything crooked?”</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.823" offset="11590614">That hasn't been sufficient to convince this Court to throw away the decisions based on the doctrine that a jury trial is not required in contempt cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.961" offset="11647248">But there is a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.768" offset="11654457">And the Harris shows there's a solution by showing that there's a difference between the contempt in the presence of the court and the contempt not in the presence of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.693" offset="11690193">Now, once there is no necessity for speed, once there is no necessity for vindicating the authority of the judge immediately, I'll go along even for a summary conviction in a court trial, even the sentence is delayed if the man behaves very badly in the court and the judge don't want to punish him at that particular moment even though because it might hurt the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.499" offset="11801370">But where a contempt does not occur in the presence of the court, it isn't such a radical change, he's given the right to counsel, he's given the right to subpoena any witnesses, proof beyond the reasonable doubt, what is wrong with having a jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.193" offset="11868139">Now, the argument that the Government has created, the jury, that there are unsympathetic jurors around, I've never found them but there maybe popular defendants and I never heard of any popular defendant except one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.970" offset="11923205">I heard recently mentioned but that's a fear that there's no excuse for overthrowing -- why that's apparent on the face of the Constitution, Article III, Article -- Amendment Five, Amendment Six.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.344" offset="11996766">Seven, the founders of this country was so concerned about a jury that they even put into an amendment that a trial for more than $20, you must have a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.215" offset="12044204">Now, it's exasperating to feel that when you have these sentences of six months, less or more, not incurring the presence of a grand jury that the judge who has his own order defied has the power to sentence you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.770" offset="12122467">Now, look how the -- how the Government defended it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.225" offset="12136260">On page 65 of their Harris brief, nor is the rule proposed by the Barnett, this is Barnett dictum, it's the Harris brief, if Your Honor please, I don't know -- a significant protection against unfair convictions for those accused of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.289" offset="12220479">Even under that rule, a district judge could summarily convict an alleged contemnor and sentence him to less than six months imprisonment or to whatever term is the constitutional maximum for petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.222" offset="12276276">This is the Government, that Barnett dictum does not therefore afford protection against unfair determination of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.957" offset="12307205">It merely ensures that lengthy imprisonment will not to be imposed, without the intervention of someone other than the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.718" offset="12338239">Well, at some insurance at least anywhere, at least I have a cutoff point of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.346" offset="12356733">But further, a similar safeguard available for contempt cases but not for other crimes is the rule that appellate courts may review and revise contempts of sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.358" offset="12404799">Now the word similar is a wrong word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.829" offset="12414725">You can't say that an appellate review is similar to a trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.919" offset="12443042">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.551" offset="12445550">A jury would have acquitted this man without leaving the jury box, with these particular three questions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.217" offset="12484211">Now, as I say, here's a -- oh, there is something else I must call Your Honor's attention to, and it's this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.120" offset="12531858">In terms of separating as I say, I spend so much time on the reasonableness and I'm sorry, I have to make a jury type of argument at this Court but that's because I didn't have an opportunity to make a speech to the jury or I should have made it in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.248" offset="12596328">On page 45 of the Shillitani brief, it states this, in the same investigation, other witnesses, also a footnote, other witnesses including Shillitani similarly refused to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.068" offset="12651604">Well, that's a misstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.412" offset="12661008">Sure, it was an oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.466" offset="12669262">You can't say other witnesses similarly refused to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.706" offset="12686190">Here is a man who answered every single question, every single question pertaining to the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.213" offset="12716178">Now what does the Government say in order to defend on the ground that it's reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.592" offset="12741778">And if Birkenstein was arguing this case, she would say, “Most unreasonable, most unreasonable, most unreasonable,” what does the Government say?</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.042" offset="12779499">On page 13, “We think that the District Court's judgment is supportable in light of the extensive narcotic conspiracy which was being investigated by the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.792" offset="12834565">And the possibility,” a remarkable word, “And the possibility that petitioner, Pappadio's refusal, was part of a concerted plan to hinder the investigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.928" offset="12887124">Is that what we send people to jail for two years without a jury trial, “On the possibility”?</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.429" offset="12909066">Oh, anything is possible but you can search the record from top to bottom inside, out -- you won't find -- there's no possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.057" offset="12951594">There's no possibility that -- that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.810" offset="12962565">They say, “A possibility” and when the Government has to resort to the possibility to sustain a sentence of two years on the ground that's reasonable, they don't have anything more, then I say it's most unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.118" offset="13007809">Now, there's another argument that the Government has thrown in about this two-year business and I'll conclude with that and that's this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.368" offset="13040828">They said, "Well, we have a different conception about time today than the founders of the country had, at the time of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.163" offset="13076041">That time -- time doesn't mean anything, two years then and two years now, all the different things entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.946" offset="13107179">Well, Paul Getty recently said that a billion dollar is isn't worth as much as it used to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.485" offset="13129331">But I feel that two years – 1776 is just as long than as it is in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.988" offset="13171336">If Your Honor please, this judgment should be reversed with reasonableness first in my opinion so that all district judges, and all Court of Appeal judges should know if the Barnett and the Green decision combined has any meaning that they can give out two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.257" offset="13268407">That when this Court has said appellate review will be made, that it will be made and that sentences will be reduced when they should be reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.274" offset="13312502">And I can't think of -- I just can't think of any justification for sentence of two years in a case that should be two days.</text>

            <text syncTime="3326.482" offset="13409259">I think perhaps I should address myself to the outset to the question which was raised in the colloquy with Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.121" offset="13451891">We have construed the judgment of conviction in this case as being in criminal contempt because of the specific or fixed term in the event of non-compliance with the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.808" offset="13530572">Now, it is true that the judgment of this kind obviously has a coercive as well as a punitive effect because the judge did provide that he would enter a further order in the event that the witness complied with the direction to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.418" offset="13617089">And the Court of Appeals in fact construed that judgment in the Shillitani case as giving the contemnor an unqualified assurance that the sentence would be reduced in the event that he complied with the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.249" offset="13728371">The judgment in the Pappadio case is in essentially the same form and though the Court of Appeals did not address itself to the question whether the right to termination upon compliance with the order was unqualified, in that case, I have no reason to assume that these two panels of the Court of Appeals entertained different views especially since Judge Lumbard sat on both of those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.658" offset="14070053">I do not think the possibilities of purge are therefore gone for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.120" offset="14111848">A successor grand jury has -- is continuing the same investigation of these alleged and suspected narcotics activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.327" offset="14164720">Certainly, it would be the view of the United States Attorney if this -- if these judgments were affirmed in this Court that he would be ready to provide an immediate opportunity -- would wish to provide immediate opportunity to these witnesses to give the information they have before the successor grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.648" offset="14265971">In the event that such testimony were given, it would be the Government's view that the District Court would have the power and we would say the obligation here to reduce the sentence in accordance with the purpose of the judgments originally entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.422" offset="14345070">I take purpose because it is true that the language of those judgments does in terms refer to the grand jury which was then in session.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.081" offset="14379656">However, we would have no doubt that whatever question might exist in the District Court in the event of such purge, measured against the literal terms of its judgment, there could be no question that under Rule 35, the court -- District Court could accomplish the very same thing under its authority to correct or reduce a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.353" offset="14488743">So I would say this may bear somewhat upon the point that Mr. Justice Brennan was raising that the possibilities of compliance and of purge remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.357" offset="14536808">It has been in our interpretation, however, that this judgment has the aspects of the criminal contempt judgment because in the event of noncompliance, it provides for a fixed sentence which extends, in this case, beyond the term of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.056" offset="14639626">Coming to the constitutional issues then which we think are presented, the first of these is the question whether broadly, quite irrespective of the sentence ultimately adjudged in the case, whether broadly there is a right to a jury trial in a case of criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.379" offset="14732936">And that of course is the issue -- an issue that the court has had before it several times in recent terms in the Green case, in the Barnett case, this term again in the Harris case though the decision did not reached that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.303" offset="14808586">Important though it is I shall speak to it only very briefly in view of the fact that we have argued and briefed it extensively on these past occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.436" offset="14869086">The basic argument which the Government has advanced in the various cases, in which this issue has been -- has been posed, isn't the issue turns very largely on historical considerations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.980" offset="14947244">We say, as the court has held in the past, that the framers did not regard or include contempts in the category of crimes as that term is used in our Article III or in the category of criminal prosecutions as that term appears in the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.414" offset="15049017">That rather they are regarded contempts as offenses against the court with which the court had an inherent power to deal, the point has been stated in many cases, long ago it was stated in Ex parte Burr.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.107" offset="15119757">And since the settlement of this country, the court should exercise the power to punish contempts in a summary manner such being the universal practice and the sentiment upon the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.427" offset="15173047">It cannot be supposed to that decision that the makers of the constitution meant to include it in a number of crimes entitled to trial by jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3797.322" offset="15292688">He means the universe and the colony as I take it rather than all countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.970" offset="15319228">We've also argued as Your Honors know that the first Judiciary Act very powerfully confirms this thesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.830" offset="15350680">That Act made provision for jury trial in the District Courts in civil and criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.978" offset="15383280">In another section of the same Act, it provided for trial by the court and punishment by fine or imprisonment in the discretion of the court, a provision which has continued in that form without significant change from that day to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.173" offset="15472097">And we also think lately circumstance that the Congress in 1790 passed the General Crimes Act defining all the federal crimes that it intended to punish, that it did not deal with contempt in the General Crimes Act but dealt with it rather exclusive -- dealt with it exclusively as I've indicated in the Judiciary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.789" offset="15574497">That has been the view of the court without -- it's been the view to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.554" offset="15601560">It was the view that was followed without any dissent I believe from 1789 until the 1950s when it was first questioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3898.059" offset="15695600">I read history quite differently because I think it was a very scrambling position in the court as illustrated by the trial of Judge Peck on one point and one meaning?</text>

            <text syncTime="3939.053" offset="15859545">What I had said was that none of the decisions of this Court had seemed to express any doubt until the 1950s on the proposition that the courts could deal with contempt by summary process.</text>

            <text syncTime="4454.145" offset="17919979">Now that brings me, and again, it is a point that has been dealt with before and I shall try not to be unduly repetitious to the Barnett dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.360" offset="17964805">The suggestion that even if trial by jury is not constitutionally acquired in all cases of criminal contempt, that a limitation of six months ought to be imposed either as a matter of constitutional doctrine or in the exercise of the supervisory powers where the trial court contempt is without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.061" offset="18059577">The basis of that suggestion, I take it, was the discussion in Mr. Justice Goldberg's dissenting opinion in the Barnett case, which suggested to him the possibilities that some of the colonies may have regarded contempts as akin to petty offenses in terms of the punishments which might be imposed therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.939" offset="18187160">And he cited statutes from some of the colonies in which there was provision made for a day in jail or a five-pound fine or another rather trivial penalty as suggesting that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.851" offset="18254764">It was an answer to that suggestion that we undertook the extensive historical research which we presented in the Harris case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.357" offset="18296769">And as Your Honors know, our examination of the statutes after exhaustive search of materials, which are not readily available, brought out the fact that there was no colony which had a general or comprehensive or across the board limitation upon the power of its principal courts to punish for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.552" offset="18405543">There were in many of the colonies some statutes which placed some limitations upon some kinds of contempt such as very often the relatively minor contempt of failing to appear on time in response to a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.101" offset="18479731">More than that, we found that none of the colonies had any statutory limitation upon the power of the courts to impose a penalty or punishment for disobedience of the court's order or decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.312" offset="18540648">And finally, we found that in the very jurisdictions where Mr. Justice Goldberg had observed the existence of these statutes imposing minor penalties, there were other statutes which authorized severe penalties for other more serious types of contempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.241" offset="18632286">The actual practice in colonial times we found -- confirms what the statutes might manifest, that there was no conception that contempt was a petty offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.378" offset="18688920">Many contempts were punished by quite trivial penalties just as many are today but they were in all of the colonies' instances of severe or serious punishments as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.495" offset="18741373">We also documented I think rather fully the proposition that none of the commentators, none of the judges at the time, court's opinions of the courts were not frequent but there are some events, that none of the commentators or judges of that day drew an analogy between contempt and petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.898" offset="18842937">Our conclusion is that there is no supportable historical basis for such an analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4692.724" offset="18874284">We think that contempts of authority not surprisingly were viewed with considerable gravity in the 18th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.949" offset="18903124">We think it was no inadvertence that Congress in 1789 authorized punishment by fine or imprisonment in the discretion of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.199" offset="18948159">And today, no less, we suggest that it would be an anomaly to regard a grave and desirous and deliberate contempt where it occurs as punishable only in the manner of let us say a traffic violation or similar petty offense.</text>
