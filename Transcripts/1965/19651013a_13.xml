            <text syncTime="0.000">Number 13, Walker Process Equipment Incorporated, Petitioner, versus Food Machinery &amp; Chemical Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.722">Mr. Collen you may continue with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sheldon O. Collen</label>
            <text syncTime="13.761">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.914">In the time available yesterday I undertook to demonstrate to the Court that the only claim Walker really asserts is the claim of monopolization per se so to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.662">In Walker's view, recourse to the relevant market is unnecessary to establish -- excuse me, to establish monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.878">Moreover, even if at this late date they should take the position that it is open to them to now establish a relevant market in support of a definition of monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.688">Our position is, as I indicated yesterday, that after three counterclaims it would come too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.418">I would like, as a point of departure this morning, to review very briefly the stricken pleading so that we will have it in front of us and so that it will be clear to everyone if the Court please that they claim nothing other than monopolization because there -- our points in our brief which suggests some kind of analogy to illegal tying arrangements which are proscribed of course by Section 3 of the Clayton Act or by Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.977">There is nothing to support any such claim in their pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.085">Now, if the Court please, the stricken pleading appears on page 60 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.970">They state in paragraph 15 that plaintiff including its predecessor illegally monopolized interstate and foreign commerce, that is their initial point of departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.392">They then say that the plaintiff used its patent to restrict and impede competition in interstate and foreign commerce in the sale of equipment not covered by the patent in suit thereby monopolizing trade in the said commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.040">I might say parenthetically that to the extent of that paragraph which is paragraph 20 of the complaint appearing at page 62 of the record, may purport to set forth some kind of claim of illegal tie-ins.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.209">They have abandoned any such claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.612">That is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.939">There is no question presented to the Court of illegal tie-ins.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.789">I quoted that paragraph only to indicate that the -- the final bottom line of it is that the assertion is FMC is monopolizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.045">Finally, in paragraph 2, they talk about plaintiff's unlawful monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.189">And the proper relief, if the Court please, is that this constitutes a fraud, that is the unclean hands that they're asserting, that this constitutes a fraud in the Patent Office and on this Court, a violation of antitrust laws and unjust enrichment of plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.686">Finally, in their brief at page 2 they say and I quote, “A lawful patent monopoly is a recognized exception to the monopolies prohibited by Section 2 of the Sherman Act”.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.022">I suggest, if the Court please, as Mr. Justice Fortas proceeded yesterday, that the Walker argument proves much too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.745">The argument is based on the proposition that a patent affords a monopoly and that upon removal of the protection of the patent was we are left with an illegal monopoly within the scope of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, then I suggest would mean that any patent invalid for any reason whether it's by reason or fraudulent procurement or whether its by reasonable act of invention, or by reason of any other defect would have exactly the same consequence that Walker suggest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.593">So the entire premise that the fraudulent procurement of patent amounts without more, prima facie or per se to monopolization under Section 2 really attempts to prove much more than they begin to find necessary to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.478">And because it proves much more than as necessary it shows I think the essential insufficiency of the concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.881">Now, the Government however comes to their aid in a sense by producing a more discriminating argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.052">The Government really directly defines the offensive monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.092">At the Government's brief at page 12, they say that the offensive monopolization under Section 2 is established by proof, one that the defendant possess the power to exclude competitors from the relevant market and that the powers deliberately obtained or maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.046">However, the Government rather than showing out its definition and applying it to the situation and asking where is the relevant market with respect to the patent which is suppose to constitute illegal monopolization under Section 2, takes the position for purposes of this case or I take it for purposes of any attack on the patent based on fraudulent procurement that the very scope of the patent's claims somehow presumes market control.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.230">So the Government by that kind of prestidigitation, by that kind of presumption with one fell swoop as it were eliminates the necessity of looking to the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.663">Whereas the Court has in case after case after case, in the various Government agencies in case after case have carefully examined in monopolization cases a question of what constitutes the relevant market because the talk of monopolization or a controllable market without talking about the prescribed market is really to talk about one side of a point without the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.955">The only attempted enforcement leaves you with the violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act as illegal monopolization per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.207">There is no case of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.017">Now, there are cases if the Court please which is -- are to be expected, where some kind of fraudulent procurement of a patent has been involved in a whole scheme or conspiracy or an attempted monopoly under Section 1 and Section 2 where like anything else, the fraudulent procurement of the patent comprises part of an overall plan to monopolize or part of an overall restraint of trade under Section 1.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sheldon O. Collen</label>
            <text syncTime="479.483">Yes, I would say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.046">And likewise of course it's a suit by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.948">It isn't a private suit where an individual is alleging injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.417">However there is nothing in their case Your Honor which would suggest that the procurement of the patent by fraudulent means would ergo without more or constitute illegal monopolization under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.496">There we have a scheme of concert, a plan of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.812">Now, the Government yesterday made no real efforts to support the proposition that a patent somehow is prima facie support for or evidence of market control.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.695">I would like to suggest to the Court and I think there is no question about it that the case which they rely on, the Standard Stations case and the subsequent cases where the Court has in passing talked about a patent evidencing market control are strictly cases of tie-in agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.900">These are cases either under Section 3 of the Clayton Act or under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.011">The question in those cases with respect to the patent is simply how much leverage is available to the patent holder as a means to accomplish his illegal tie-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.845">For example, the inquiry really under Section 3 and that was the inquiry, in the Standard Stations case where the Court was comparing the perniciousness of requirements contracts to tying agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.469">The inquiry really is whether there is sufficient dominance over the tie-in product to have the leverage to be able to force the sale of the other products.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.772">Now in that context, in the context of a tying arrangement where the question is really whether in fact there is actual power to accomplish a tying arrangement whether there's actual power to force the customer to take something besides the tying product.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.143">It -- for illustrative purposes was said in the Standard Stations case and subsequently in Times-Picayune, that yes, for that purpose a patent may be prima facie evidence of market control.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.030">But I suggest to the Court that although for that purpose, a patent may suggest some kind of market control or dominance, that does not mean that for purposes of Section 2 of the Sherman Act that a patent all by itself completely defines a relevant market and constitutes monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act if it should turn out to be an unlawfully obtained patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.092">I would like to quote in that connection and to summarize that suggestion to the Court from Times-Picayune, 345 U.S. at page 611.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.419">There the Court said that Section 2 outlaws monopolization of any appreciable part of interstate commerce and by Section 1 unreasonable restraints are banned irrespective of the amount of commerce involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.899">But the essence of illegality in tying agreements is the wielding of monopolistic leverage, a seller exploits his dominant position in one market to expand his empire into the next.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.719">So I suggest to the Court finally that for purposes of understanding the basic nature of a tying agreement and the kind of control that had defended may have been such a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.207">Yes, for that purpose, control to a patent may suggest the capacity, the ability prima facie to force a tying arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.066">But again, I suggest that has nothing to do with the definition of monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.335">Now, I suggest if the Court please that that approach, that argument that the Government advances to relieve itself from the necessity of making a market investigation and to arrive at the concept of per se illegality is completely specious --</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.479">If the Court please -- in returning to your inquiry Mr. Justice White, besides talking about antitrust violation they talked about unfair competition, they talked about unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.662">They argued to the Court of Appeals that they did not have the obligation to provide a legal category on the basis on which relief was available, that they were hurt in some way by the so-called fraudulent procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.020">They must have some remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.328">And the response to the proposition that they must have some remedy was the proposition finally adopted by the Court but not expressed if the Court please, in a very artistic fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.041">That there was no automatic conversion feature between this defense of unclean hands or fraudulent procurement and the availability of any kind of affirmative relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.657">Now, that had been the law in the Seventh Circuit and the District Courts had followed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.757">I agree that the problem of the opinion of the Court of Appeals would leave them if the Court of Appeals' opinion stood in a position where under no circumstances they could -- they plead a good and valid monopolization case under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.673">But I also suggest that the most that's involved in the Court of Appeals' opinion in -- on that basis is a hypothetical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.281">What the Court of Appeals in effect says and what bothers the Government in the Court of Appeals' opinion is that the Gov -- the Court of Appeals suggest that fraud in the Patent Office can never be part of a showing of violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.061">Now if all that this Court were concerned with were the opinion of the Court of Appeals, then this Court would say, I suggest, that that is inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.734">That certainly, under appropriate circumstances, fraud on the Patent Office could be a violation of Section 1 or of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.668">But if we are left with only that hypothetical consideration, that cannot dispose of the litigation and I suggest very emphatically that that is not the question as they presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.661">And what attracted the Government to this case, I suggest, and the reason they came in was an opportunity to find a new area of per se illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.240">Here where you have a patent allegedly procured by fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.992">You have Section 2 monopolization without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.923">The relevant market is presumed and if the Court please, now the Justice Department should go out and get a summary judgment without any market investigation, without any study of the relevant factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.932">If it can just establish that the patent was procured by fraud and then enforced, I suggest that is why the Justice Department came into this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.962">If there were only the question of the correctness of the Court of Appeals' opinion, the Justice Department would be unable to take the position it does by its question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.276">In question two, which is the question for certiorari presented by Walker, would not really be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.674">Now the Court, as I understand it, in the exercise of the certiorari jurisdiction is concerning itself with the question presented by the party and it is their question that they presented and we are undertaking as best as we can to show the insufficiency of their solution to the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.047">Yesterday in response to questions from the bench and so to say the relevance of the relevant market to the concept of monopoly, counsel for the Government took the position that, well, sometimes we need relevant market and sometimes we have situations that are illegal per se and we don't need a relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.737">I would like if I can and if the Court please to try to underscore the situations where relevant market is necessarily and universally a requirement and I think it takes a very little analysis to get to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.299">When we're talking about per se violations ordinarily we are in the realm of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.630">Section 1 of course as for its ultimate criterion the question of reasonableness, reasonableness of the restraint and the Court has held in a handful of situations price fixing, through boycotts perhaps unlawful tie-ins and horizontal divisions of market that in those situations the restraint is per se prima facie if it were illegal because it has no justification whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.422">It obviously and patently forecloses competition between competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.283">It's only question under Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.919">When we get to Section 2 however, we are not talking about foreclosing the competition of an individual competitor or suppressing the competition of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.207">We are talking about either monopolization, attempted monopolization, or a combination or conspiracy to monopolize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.434">Now if the Court please, the act nowhere talks about a monopoly as Mr. Justice Holmes observed many years ago in the Northern Securities case having a monopoly is not the same thing by any means as the offensive monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.621">The monopolization that the Court is talking about which for many, many seasons so to speak and in many, many cases, it is carefully defined relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.132">The monopolization under Section 2 that it is talking about relates to some control, some capacity to exclude competition in some kind of a relevant market coupled with either an historical effort and intent to obtain that control or other unlawful conduct in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.134">To eliminate from the concept of Section 2 monopolization, the feature of what is monopolized is, if the Court please, I think completely untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.663">Likewise, when we get into the area of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, again we are talking about the relevant market because we are talking about the possible adverse effect on competition or tendency to create a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.392">So when we look at a merger case as the Court did in Brown Shoe and seven rate merger cases since then, or when we look at a monopolization case under Section 1, we are looking to the market effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.286">We are looking to the broad scope of the probability that competition will or will not be affected in some specified and relevant area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.282">That however is not the case under Section 1 where we're just looking for suppression of competition as to an individual competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.828">And generally speaking, it is not the case as to Section 3 of the Clayton Act where we were likewise looking to the position of an individual upon whom products have been forced by reason of the control of the seller over some kind of a tie-in product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.435">So, it is not a question that the Court may sometimes say, “Well, we have to look to the relevant market in some other times.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.192">Say, “Well, we won't look to the relevant market,” it's purely and simply, if the Court please, a question of understanding the operation of the various provisions of the Sherman Act and of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.427">And once again, I underscore and reemphasize that as far as monopolization under Section 2 is concerned, the result of what I say is that without a relevant market, there can't be any monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.747">I suggest too, as a matter of policy if the Court please, that we have in our society very few absolutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.103">We have, as I have indicated, very few categories of per se liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.423">In the complexity and the richness of our social and economic fabric, there are always distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.693">There are always facts and circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.672">There are always special situations that have to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.629">Every time we establish some new category of per se liability, whether it's under the Sherman Act or under any other provision of law, we are losing something of value because in the final analysis, there is no substitute for concrete investigation of the concrete facts and circumstances of a particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.479">Now, if the Court please, I would like to consider, if I may, the apparent inappropriateness of this particular case for the Court to undertake to make any kind of pronouncements that might be construed by the lower court's and the bar to be (Inaudible) or far reaching or constitute the development of a new category of liability under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.590">Counsel for Walker yesterday elaborated at length and the alleged fraud in this case attempting to tar FMC Corporation with the black brush of bad conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.011">I would like to suggest to the Court that of course the conclusions of fraud for purposes of testing the sufficiency of the pleading are accepted, that is a necessary point in order to work off of a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.581">However, I invite the Court's rotation to the way Walker pleaded the question of fraud in its amended counterclaims, the predecessor to the stricken pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.276">There Walker said the plaintiff committed at least a technical fraud on the Patent Office by representing that the patent that not be on sale or in public use for more than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.237">At that time, when Walker was so pleading, it did not regard the fraud as some kind of vicious and horrendous and indefensible situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.842">In addition, I would like to suggest to the Court and this is apparent from the record, the plaint -- the original complaint shows that the patent is the Lannert Patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.418">And FMC Corporation is a subsequent assignee of that patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.554">Lannert was an employee of Chicago Pump Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.772">The patent was applied for in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.216">In 1954, FMC Corporation acquired all the assets of Chicago Pump Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.865">Now, I think most likely from the standpoint of the rights of creditors and others, FMC company is of course liable for the acts of its predecessor although we have that situation from the standpoint of attributing to FMC Corporation most of the elements necessary to create the offense of monopolization namely, the monopoly power coupled with the monopolistic intent which is supposed to be evidenced by the fraudulent procurement of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.112">From that standpoint, the case presents a peculiar wrinkle because it was a remote individual predecessor of FMC who applied for the patent and it was that individual if there was a fraud committed on the Patent Office who was guilty of that fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.966">Now, to take in a case where the facts have not been tried, where the facts are merely speculative and based on the allegations of the pleader and couple that remote intention with the subsequent activity of FMC Corporation in enforcing the patent and say that those two fit together to subject FMC Corporation to the offensive monopolization, that presents a problem which I think properly, if that were the question in the case, would have to be tried, the defenses would have to be tried out and the facts would have to be ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.495">Those difficulties plus the very difficulty of the nature of their pleading and the ultimate confusion that they expressed in their briefs and in their proper relief suggesting really that what their complaining about is analogous to a tying situation which of course it really is not because this is not a leverage situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.167">FMC has not used the patent to force anyone, let alone Walker, to acquire something in addition to the patent and product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.136">There is no tie-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.065">There is no forcing of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.376">So that the analogy really, if the Court please, simply has no bearing on the situation, couple that with the factor that when they say in their suggestion of damages that they were deprived of the opportunity to compete with Walker -- excuse me, with FMC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.612">What they're saying by that really is that if it were a Sherman Act Section 1 case, they had been injured, their competition were suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.883">And accordingly because it looks like a Sherman Section 1 from that standpoint, they ought to have some kind of cause of action under the antitrust laws which of course they cannot allege because there's no element of combination or conspiracy or contract which is requisite to Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.361">And the finding in their previous pleadings and in their briefs, an effort is set forth some kind of common law fraud claim, some kind of claim of unfair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.263">It was seen really that if an action to a private party were available under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that that is really what their complaining about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.106">Some kind of unfair method of competition that Walker -- excuse me, that FMC had this patent an item that they were unable to successfully compete with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.372">And that FMC had fraudulently procured it that might be some method of unfair competition interdicted by Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.819">We have all of these difficulties in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.503">It does not seem to lend itself to a definitive pronouncement by the Court in this state of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.493">Nonetheless, I would like to make this perfectly clear once again if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.034">I am not suggesting that this case should go back to the District Court with an opportunity for them to amend this thing once more and to figure out if there is in some way now after having presented this per se question to this Court, isn't there some way now that they can go ahead and state their claims for relief under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.484">I am not suggesting that, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.163">I'm suggesting only in the first instance that on the question presented, they have not stated a claim for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.529">Their legal theory leaves them up against the blind wall because they cannot simply equate the fraudulent procurement of the patent or a patent monopoly with Sherman Act monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.979">And secondly, that they have had their day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.430">If every time a party were to lose on the basis of illegal theory, that it's made three efforts to carry through the District Court and the Court of Appeals, and then up to the Supreme Court, if every time they could do that and start out all over again, we would never finish with the processes of litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2563.620">In that connection, I would like again to refer to the Hartford-Empire against Shawkee which is recited in our brief on the same page 9 and the subsequent case in the District -- in the Court of Appeals where the patent had been set aside by fraud 11 years after the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.134">And they held that while the statute of limitations was gone, I mean, had passed and expired, a recovery would be allowed simply on the ground of improper use of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.752">And among those was attorneys fees, they refused to allow a business recovery not on the ground of statute of limitations but on the ground that it had not been proved properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.205">The matter of relevant market, it's really -- has come up here for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.480">I think as Mr. Justice Black says doesn't belong here for discussion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.690">As to Mr. Justice Black's question, I wouldn't say however that -- I think that we have a tendency, I'm primarily a patent lawyer and not an antitrust lawyer, we have a tendency to make secondary rules of construction of revenues and then forget that they are secondary such as change or form doesn't amount to invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.598">That's only in its evidence, it isn't, the ultimate fact is whether or not there was invention, there was unobvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.865">So here, the ultimate fact is whether or not the plaintiff had -- was able to control prices in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.596">If he was able to control prices, relevant market is not of importance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.006">It's only important as it was in the Cellophane case to show because controlling prices is not normally an easy thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.586">You have to take the eloquent evidence on it and in that case, there were plenty of other wrapping materials that indicated that there was no ability to control prices even though it had a monopoly, (Inaudible) of monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.988">So here, the -- it was left out of our second counterclaim, I would have put it in, in better form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.567">But on page 78 of the record the statement was made in paragraph 24 that before the patent expired, the prices were $150 a lineal foot and sometimes higher possibly and that after the patent expired there were $50 a running foot which certainly shows right off there that there was a controlled price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.571">Furthermore, Mr. Forrest, their man, said on page 50 that they had to control not only of the action lifter, but they had virtually no computation throughout the life of the patent in swing diffusers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.324">Not just a patent of swing diffusers but any swing diffusers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.923">So that there are facts in this record which show not only there was control of prices and control of competition, but that the relevant -- what the relevant market was.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.207">Now of course we recognize that in terms of the market and as I think this Court is self-recognized in the footnote in the Northern Pacific opinion that not every patent in the classical sense necessarily gives a monopoly and that it has complete power to exclude from all competing substitutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3295.612">I think, one, as I attempted to argue yesterday, when you deal with a special case of a patent that is procured by a fraud, the considerations which normally apply to defining a market don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.118">And then the second point I tried to make was -- which I just made a moment -- trying to make a moment ago to you, if it was -- if that argument is to be rejected, if in fact even in this case the market need be defined, still the case should go back as we do think that even if the market has to be defined, the market power that rest on a fraudulent procured patent is enough in that situation to ground illegal monopoly if the requisite market position is sustained.</text>
