            <text syncTime="283.173" offset="1236093">Now, I believe and I hope that the court could resolve all these problems and I know it's quite a job and, after being before this Court for more than 30 years, I've never yet been able to penetrate the mysteries of the ground that the court selects for its decision on whenever there are competing constitutional questions, but I must say that from what I've observed in the courts of the State of New York and the courts of other jurisdictions in which I was counsel and otherwise, that there is a great need that these questions be resolved now.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.138" offset="1727927">The first category was that he possessed these books for distribution or sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.701" offset="1798144">And the fourth category was that he published them without putting his name in violation of the General Business Law of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.964" offset="1839208">The latter part was declared unconstitutional by our New York courts, and so it remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.814" offset="1866585">So that for each category, he received a jail sentence of one year to run concurrently -- I'm sorry, consecutively, so that all-in-all he has three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.245" offset="1936384">And I should point out here too that the jail sentences were on counts 1, 48, and 65 because I think it may be of value to Your Honors to know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.290" offset="1996570">The -- but I should also emphasize this, that there are no facts in the record which showed that he knew that these books were the character that the statute proscribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.202" offset="2092178">In other words, my emphasis is placed on this aspect of the Smith against California decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="713.287" offset="2956518">In 1956, the New York statute was amended to add with the words -- to the obscenity statute the words “sadistic” and “masochistic”.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.159" offset="3027989">Up to that time, we had a string of words in the statute that -- relating to obscenity, but there wasn't satisfaction with that statute by the prosecuting authorities because they -- according to the legislative documents that I have briefed to Your Honors, they felt that the obscenity statute was not adequate to cover sadistic and masochistic literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.179" offset="3204054">I submit to Your Honors that from this legislative history alone, one must conclude that these two words are completely independent from the word “obscenity” as had heretofore been used in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="870.403" offset="3585024">This Court has said time and time again that only obscene books may be proscribed, and if sadistic and masochistic books are of a different nature, then the statute violates the doctrines of this Court in construing the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.290" offset="3704560">I agree that New York is hard-put to this statute and now argues and demand that Mr. Justice Harlan has stated, and that is that they are synonyms for obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.309" offset="3780629">If they are synonyms, I can't see what the need for them had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.511" offset="3809468">Were they just trying to add additional words to the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="934.021" offset="3839457">They came into the statute specifically, as the legislative finding show, because of the need to get at these books.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.370" offset="3884805">So therefore, I submit to Your Honors that so far as this statute seeks to prohibit sadistic books or masochistic books, the statute is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.403" offset="3992952">I turn to the question now, “What does the word “sadistic and masochistic” mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="987.111" offset="4051780">According to general use, they mean the infliction of punishment and the enjoyment by the inflictor and masochism is the converse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.330" offset="4108727">That to me is the same problem you had in the Winters case where you had to rule on the statute which proscribed literature made up of stories of bloodshed, lust, and -- bloodshed, lust, and crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.134" offset="4179884">And the court said literature could be made up of those things because if the statute sought broadly to proscribe such literature, there's no end to the amount of literature that may be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.598" offset="4293778">Now, in connection with what was said by the lower court here, if the construction of the lower court were accepted as for the first time construing this statute so as to bring this defendant within the net of the statute, then clearly, my client is made the guinea pig to supply legislative deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.779" offset="4470471">That was what was before the court in the Lanzetta case and that is what this Court said, that you cannot, for the first time, construe a statute in such a way as to bring a man within its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.746" offset="4538389">The legislature has to be clear in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.384" offset="4560959">And also, in the Winters case, I recall the court ordered a re-argument and asked counsel to brief that very question because it was claimed too in that case that a construction was being made for the very first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.757" offset="4650402">The court didn't have to pass upon it because it assumed that the statute was clear for the sake of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.595" offset="4677778">But if the lower court had for the first time, made a construction so as to render this man's conduct guilty, then I say such a construction is an invalid, one that's a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.835" offset="4766699">It should also be said that in the trial court's decision nor in any other court was any finding made as to which particular books fell into a category of obscenity and which particular books fell into the category of being sadistic or masochistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.894" offset="4886967">There was a general broad pronouncement by the trial court that these books were obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.592" offset="4933778">In view of that, since there was no separation made by the court or any finding made as to any particular books, there has to be a reversal in the event you find some of these books obscene, but seen in some books sadistic, because you cannot tell which books the courts found to be in which category, and that is exactly what this Court did in the Stromberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.480" offset="5109321">Now -- I turn now to the question whether or not these books -- particular books are obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.894" offset="5154983">These are the books I would say are of the type of books that were referred to in the Klaw case that Justice Brennan spoke about before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.274" offset="5220498">These are books that seem to have been directed to a certain class of people who might get a certain amount of pleasure from them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.351" offset="5892786">And, to prove that any book has a redeeming social value puts the court in the position of being a literary critic, and whether or not a court wishes to be a literal -- a literary critic is another story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.431" offset="5965093">The fact is, however, the court has to review these cases and unfortunately, has to read all these books.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.523" offset="6421504">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.389" offset="6440939">I propose to divide my argument in a rather conventional manner, discussing first the substantive issues, meaning of the term “obscenity” and particularly as applied to materials of this character and coming second, to the procedural points which are raised by the trial -- the prosecution, trial, and conviction of Edward Mishkin exactly five years ago in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.821" offset="6554624">I hope that I may launch the first stage of my argument from the premise that there is something in this world of wonders which is called “obscenity” and that, whatever it may be it does escape through the narrow crack in the door from the protected enclave of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.590" offset="6641768">Perhaps, at that point, I should heed the advice of Mr. Justice Stewart and others and may it merely submit the exhibits to the court with the statement that I believe that the court, upon examination of the exhibits themselves, will find that they are in fact obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.578" offset="6717733">But, I confess that I cannot force myself to sit down so soon when there are so many challenging concepts before the court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.255" offset="6768410">The distinction between the obscene and the permissible has been described as a dim and uncertain mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.336" offset="6808743">Many who have labored at the task have confessed themselves unable to formulate a precise general definition of the obscene which was susceptible of ready application, particularly in the difficult areas which are called “borderline.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.937" offset="6887111">It is the hope, I'm sure, of this Court in hearing these appeals and of all other courts which have considered this question that somehow through the series of decisions, not merely the words used in the opinion, the precise scope of the test of obscenity will become increasingly clear and more readily susceptible of application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.192" offset="6984182">I, for one, think that where tests are concerned, the formulation -- the famous formulation of the Roth case is an excellent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.903" offset="7027022">I do believe that being expressed in but a single sentence in that decision and that sentence combining several different concepts that it might be helpful if that test -- if the basic skeleton of that test are could be filled in by some further explication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.258" offset="7104449">It is our interpretation and our submission to this Court that the Roth test is, in effect, a tripod standing on three legs, all three of which are necessary to support any conviction or restriction upon the dissemination of printed matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.603" offset="7181772">Those three legs, I think, embrace quite different considerations and the total effect of the three together, properly interpreted would assure us that there would be no criminal prosecution or restriction on the pre-dissemination of material which should enjoy the protections of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.152" offset="7271946">In my way of thinking, the first of these are these three indispensable legs is the patent offensiveness test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.201" offset="7388139">This is a standard which I think characterizes the reaction of the communities to allegedly obscene or pornographic matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.611" offset="7681860">It has to be stimulated an affirmative feeling of rejection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.442" offset="7753122">The offensiveness must be a gross one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.465" offset="7761272">The affront to community standards must be a significant one, an appreciable one, and I think it should be judged by that wonderful legal affliction, the average member of the community, not the highly sophisticated, not the particularly puritanical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.394" offset="7832952">That construct, if such a person does exist, who does represent an amalgam of the values of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.842" offset="7866702">As to that test, it seems to me that, although this Court has assumed the burden of review of offensiveness in the first instance in the Manual Enterprise case, it seems to me that particularly where a conviction comes from a state court and particularly where the fact finder, be a court or a juror, was appreciative of the appropriate definition of the standard and the scope of the measurement that a sufficient evidence rule would be appropriate upon review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2005.973" offset="8127300">Well, for those who do not accept the distinction, I assume that we must simply expand our imagination and, as we conceive of the local community standards, so we must attempt to conceive of the national community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.055" offset="8187591">I suggest that it becomes somewhat more complex because of the diverse values in different sections of the country, but I -- perhaps it is not all that difficult since there are very diverse values even in so small community as the city from which I held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.923" offset="8263032">I don't think that there is any question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.086" offset="8275675">I have heard no argument raised that this material is offensive, that however the community be defined, however, the average man within that community be imagined, that he would find the materials in this case that Mishkin directed and published and sold to be offensive, to be somewhere beyond that critical point and into the area of shame.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.411" offset="8389047">The second test, it seems to me, is the test of redeeming social value because, clearly, not everything which the common man, which the average man, rejects as offensive is -- can be prohibited consistently with the principles of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.895" offset="8466996">It seems to me that the test of social value or redeeming importance is one which should more appropriately be made by someone who is more sensitive to the esoteric values that usually go into that sort of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.752" offset="8538363">I don't suggest that the court is of a scientific authority or even a literary critic, but the court does have the assistance of literary critics and experts and, moreover, the court does represent a body which has certain amount of familiarity with materials which might be deemed offensive by the ordinary laymen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.740" offset="8630314">Consequently, it does seem to me that the test of redeeming social value, an extremely important one, is one for the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.303" offset="8660616">I don't necessarily suggest that this Court must assume that obligation in the first instance every time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.186" offset="8688097">It does seem to me that the appellate structures within the state applying standards which have been laid down by this Court are entitled to a certain amount of respect by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.685" offset="8734072">And, if their conclusion is reasonable with respect to social importance, it may not be necessary for this Court to assume the enormous burden of reading the materials one by one in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.991" offset="8787362">Listening to the colloquy or in earlier arguments this afternoon, I might say that I would never have suggested in the first instance that the court could assume a burden so enormous, not to mention unending, repetitive, and unpleasant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.454" offset="8845145">In fact, in assuming the burden, the court recognized the unpleasantness of the task but apparently felt impelled to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.577" offset="8877641">I -- however, once it has been assumed by the court, of course I am not in the position to say that the court should not continue to exercise it, if you call upon to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.633" offset="8925915">Essentially, what, again in this instance, the facts of this case are such, that there really is no substantial question, there is no argument, there is no contest, there is no claim made here by the petitioners, that any one of these many exhibits in evidence has the slightest value -- social value, or whether that term be conceived of as a scientific, artistic, literary, or any other value of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.745" offset="9046392">Consequently, there's no real dispute, it seems to me, as to that lack of a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.169" offset="9068022">Of course, what the dispute on obscenity boils down to is the third, and critical and perhaps the most confusing aspect of this test, and that is the appeal to prurient interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.513" offset="9125386">The original formulation of Roth, of course, stated whether to the average man, applying contemporary standards, the dominant appeal of the work taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.266" offset="9184423">Now, this separation of the average man and prurient interest in that terminology has been overlooked by a number of jurisdictions who have simply read the tasks as appeal to the prurient interest of the average man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.980" offset="9247326">Now, it seems to me that there are grave difficulties if the measure, the litmus, of prurient appeal be the average man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.560" offset="9281599">For one thing, we are told by such experts as the Kronhausen's and Lockhart and McClure, and others, that the essential nature of the most easily recognizable form of obscenity is its appeal to those whose sexual development has been in some way either arrested or distorted that while these materials, perhaps the more conventional type of obscenity, undoubtedly have a certain erotic effect on almost any mature person and maybe some immature person, or even knowing that there is a stimulating quality, an erotically stimulating quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.182" offset="9468113">That, if we talk of appeal in terms of an exaggerated interest in the materials, that such appeal would be found only in those who suffer from that sort of loneliness, immaturity, fright, and other distortions of the normal sexual appetites and I don't think that this Court could possibly have intended to postulate an average man to whose prurient interest, the most undisguised pornography appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.888" offset="9606875">Perhaps one of the difficulties is the use of the phrase in the Roth case, which had been rejected by the earlier formulation of the American Law Institute, “arouses lustful thoughts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.022" offset="9663509">The arousal of a lustful thought, it seems to me is quite another matter than the appeal to prurient interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.887" offset="9698931">If the word “prurient” be taken to mean an exaggerated lascivious interest and the appeal be considered something more than the ordinary appeal that many perfectly innocent objects might have, then it seems to me that one is not dealing with the average man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.694" offset="9774164">One is dealing with a particular susceptible branch of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.157" offset="9792031">And this is true both with respect to the so-called conventional pornography and the bizarre specialized form of pornography, that is -- makes up the bulk of the exhibits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.303" offset="10020551">I do think that, in judging -- in selecting the group by which the prurient appeal should be measured, one must take into consideration the circumstances of the distribution of the material, the apparent target the group was intended to be affected by it, and to consider, in addition, what has been called “those into whose hands the material is likely to fall”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.591" offset="10121697">Now, lest there'd be any -- as we point out in the brief, lest there'd be any mistake about it, this does not signify any degree of return to the discredit in the Hicklin test because in that Hicklin test of course, the circumstance were not -- the test was not based upon this tripartite consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.353" offset="10200795">If I take as my measure of prurient appeal in this material, let us say even a small susceptible group who find a morbid and sick attraction to this sort of material and prohibited, I am doing so not simply on the basis of the specialized group, but I am doing so on the basis of the revulsion which the community at large feels against it in deeming it offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.902" offset="10302986">And I am doing it after the material has been adjudged to be utterly without social value by a responsible reviewing group.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.542" offset="12429563">I do think also, there must be some clarification of prurient interest in terms of interest rather than stimulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.707" offset="12478151">Thinking now, the moment of those exhibits in this collection which are somewhat more conventional in their sexuality, these so-called hardcore types of pornography do have, undoubtedly, a certain stimulating effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.184" offset="12568116">Nonetheless, I don't think that on that account, they could be called an appeal to prurients particularly as that is defined as a morbid or sick and unusual attraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.436" offset="12621093">With respect to the procedural issues which are involved in this case, the suggestion has been made that there must be some sort of a prior adversary proceeding in as much as these lines are deemed uncertain so that a perspective defendant would have a way of knowing whether the particular material in question was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.540" offset="12721507">The suggestion is made relying on Marcus and Quantity of Books against Kansas that a search warrant cannot issue without such a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.927" offset="12763094">Now, I suggest that this is a wholly impractical and unnecessary consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.581" offset="12785664">First, in this case, there is no search and seizure problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.992" offset="12803323">The vast majority of the books of 15,000 were taken from a warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.206" offset="12824221">They were taken from the warehouse not only by a search warrant, which had been obtained some years before Mapp against Ohio, by a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.598" offset="12861733">But more importantly, they were clearly taken by a consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.014" offset="12879391">The defendant's accomplice, Mr. Levenberg, conferred with his lawyer, and the lawyer and the accomplice decided to give these books which were in the exclusive control and custody of Mr. Levenberg up to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.798" offset="12930591">And, that is the way in which the -- there couldn't be a clearer example of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.841" offset="12946787">So, there is no search and seizure problem as to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.603" offset="12957759">As to the others, some were bought in bookstores by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.659" offset="12978030">There couldn't be a search and seizure question there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.330" offset="12992658">But, in any event, it seems to me that a prior adversary proceeding, although it would be helpful in a sense there could be some determination of obscenity before prosecution, would only be a workable device where the defendant himself is willing to submit the exhibits in question for such a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.491" offset="13073324">It would be a wholly impractical device in any instance in which -- in other words, the closer you get to the core of the hardcore, the more impractical this procedure becomes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.665" offset="13118046">If you serve a perspective defendant with a subpoena duces tecum to produce a certain stag movie for a -- proceeding under 22 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in New York, you would be very lucky if the defendant himself showed up, let alone bring the stag movie with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.455" offset="13193174">Consequently, the only way in which there can be a determination of obscenity with respect to the really bad material is by obtaining the evidence first in ex -- as the effect of an ex parte order.</text>
