            <text syncTime="34.642" offset="241977">Mr. Lewis?</text>

            <label>Mr. James B. Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="36.329" offset="248665">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="40.350" offset="264756">This case, here on petition for writ of certiorari to the Second Circuit presents a simple, but fundamental question of how depreciation should be computed for income tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.463" offset="333197">Ever since 1913, the income tax statute has granted us a deduction, a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion wear and tear of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.054" offset="391607">This Court has asked in this case to interpret that 42-year-old statutory language on this issue for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.135" offset="439881">The facts are undisputed and maybe quickly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.053" offset="463600">The taxpayer purchased in December of 1955, one of the old World War II Liberty ships for $469,000 and proceeded to use that ship in its shipping business as a tramp steamer.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.574" offset="541654">Before making the purchase, the Commissioner came down the -- the taxpayer came down to Washington, and asked the Commissioner for a ruling on depreciation and received such a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.667" offset="598079">The Commissioner, having experience in this field, rule that this Liberty ship was to be depreciated over a three-year useful life that the amount to be depreciated was the $469,000 cost plus a salvage value based on scrap of $5 a dead-weight ton or $54,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.587" offset="693687">And that the depreciable amount $415,000 was to be written off over the three-year useful life under the straight-line basis, one-third each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.636" offset="745932">The taxpayer followed the ruling letter meticulously.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.558" offset="765576">A year later, something happen that no one could have expected, the Suez Canal crisis erupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.584" offset="789713">The canal was blocked for about six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.241" offset="804342">And when it reopened, it reopened under Egyptian management that many people then had limited confidence in.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.827" offset="842689">During this brief crisis, the prices of all kinds of ships even Liberty ships rose spectacularly because the necessity of going around Africa caused a brief, but severe, shipping crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.432" offset="933073">During 1957, all of 1957 except the last eight days, the taxpayer operated its ship, produced a gross profit from that operation of almost $300,000 and filed an income tax return on which disclosed that profit and deducted there from its expenses including the depreciation of about $135,000 that had been authorized in the ruling letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.154" offset="1051982">The taxpayer had a substantial net profit for 1957 roughly $140,000 from the operation of this and a less important ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.988" offset="1107362">Having received and unsolicited and attractive offer from a competitor during the Suez crisis, the taxpayer sold the Liberty ship in December of 1957 for the price of about $695,000.</text>

            <label>Mr. James B. Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="271.283" offset="1188551">For two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.324" offset="1200671">The dispute here arises from the Commissioner's total disallowance of depreciation for the ship for 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.728" offset="1238288">The Commissioner asserts that the depreciation, which he concedes, to have been correctly established by the ruling letter was nevertheless the automatically disallowed for one reason only because the sale of the ship produced a profit.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="301.000" offset="1307355">The rule for which he contends limited to the -- that year, that the year in which the sale was made.</text>

            <label>Mr. James B. Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="306.230" offset="1328253">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.639" offset="1329925">His argument on trade fair is that he here is that he will not touch and should not touch the depreciation allowed for the years prior to the year of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.402" offset="1372975">Now, although this was the first time that this narrow but significant issue has been presented to this Court, the Court is not being asked to write on a clean slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.826" offset="1426683">Year after years since 1913, hundreds and probably thousands of taxpayers every year have sold some sort of depreciable property.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.950" offset="1467120">They have reported their gain or loss on the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.834" offset="1478719">They have taken their depreciation for the year in which the sale occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.743" offset="1494392">Their returns have been subject to audit and their returns have been audited.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.170" offset="1512051">And one has only to turn to the precedents to find out what the practice was and it was uniform or as uniformed as a practice that affects thousands of taxpayers every year can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.343" offset="1572760">Depreciation was regularly allowed for the year of sale regardless of whether the sale was a gain or a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.421" offset="1601076">And we have cited in our brief to say -- well, a precedent, that reflects this fairly established administrative policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.168" offset="1640051">We have cited five early-published rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.377" offset="1656874">More than 35 Court cases, five of which reached this Court and all of which the record shows without dispute the amount of depreciation taken for the year of sale.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="402.792" offset="1714552">We'll recess now.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_b_lewis" startTime="420.041" stopTime="881.902">
            <label>Mr. James B. Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="420.041" offset="1783515">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.727" offset="1822281">I was saying that 35 or 40 Court decisions discussed in our two briefs reflect clearly the consistent allowance of depreciation for the year of sale of an asset at a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.856" offset="1898768">Five of those cases reached this Court obliquely because generally a taxpayer will accept an allowance that the Commissioner has made instead of rejecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.533" offset="1945475">So there is not an abundance of direct of adjudication on this issue prior to the last two or three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.847" offset="1974732">But the case is nevertheless reflected the consistent administrative policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.073" offset="1991659">This Court had such a case in 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.819" offset="2006601">It had such a case in 1927, the Ludey case.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.579" offset="2021648">It had such a case in 1947, the Beulah Crane against Commissioner in which the Commissioner allowed Mrs. Crane's $3200 of year of sale depreciation on her building.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.698" offset="2066160">And this Court approved the Commissioner's computation of profit on sale by subtraction of that year of sale depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.134" offset="2099911">The Court had a group of such cases in 1960 and the Massey, Evans, and Hertz decisions in which the Commissioner allowed depreciation in the year of sale of automobiles at a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.932" offset="2159052">Nevertheless, adjudication did arise, first, because a taxpayer cannot always use his depreciation deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.181" offset="2188100">If he has an access of other deductions, he may prefer not to take his depreciation and to keep the basis of his property high, so as to reduce the capital gain that he otherwise has to report at the 25% rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.624" offset="2245883">This occurred to Herbert Simons.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.154" offset="2256018">And in 1930, in a Board of Tax Appeals decision, the Commissioner argued, “Mr. Simons, you must take your year of sale depreciation even though you cannot use it because otherwise, the system of allocating part of your cost of the asset to the part used up during its life, the system will be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.567" offset="2341595">And we will not have either a correct reflection of depreciation or a correct reflection of gain on sale.”</text>
            <text syncTime="566.605" offset="2369808">And the Board of Tax Appeals says, “The Commissioner is absolutely right”.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.706" offset="2382242">This is what we have always held and this is what the courts have always held.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.780" offset="2406484">Throughout this long history and I'm talking now about 1913 to 1960, 47 years, there are two isolated cases of taxpayer contests of disallowances of year of depreciation by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.301" offset="2472626">Now of course with a widely separated administration, this can happen now and then.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.480" offset="2497285">But on an issue involved in thousands of returns annually, we find two contests in 47 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.669" offset="2534066">Both of these cases resulted in clear holdings by the Tax Court that the depreciation was allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.243" offset="2568338">In 1927 decision, Duncan-Homer and the 1947 decision Weir Long Leaf, both cases depreciation was clearly allowable for the year of profitable sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.444" offset="2621106">The Commissioner promptly acquiesced in the Weir case in 1948, and that equity essence was outstanding until the middle of 1962 when this case was already in the Courts.Congress in 1950 included in its committee report on the 1950 Revenue Act, a clear example of the taking of depreciation on an asset for the year of its profitable sale and a reporting of capital gain on the sale of that asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.711" offset="2758196">The Commissioner incorporated this committee report into the -- or the Treasury, incorporated it into the Treasury regulations and it was there from 1951, republished in 1953, again republished in 1957, and it stayed there until June of this year when the Commissioner decided it was too embarrassing and withdrew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.019" offset="2847431">The commercial accounting practice is exactly to the same effect as we've pointed out clearly in our briefs, clearly supports the tax practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.597" offset="2885778">And here, there is not an scintilla of reason for creating any divergences between commercial accounting and tax accounting for as this Court said and its latest depreciation decision, the Massey Case in 1960, the purpose of the commercial accounting and tax accounting systems here is harmonious.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.610" offset="2981804">They have the common function of achieving a proper reflection of net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.115" offset="3011793">Now during the period, that all of precedent accumulated 1913 to 1960, Congress re-enacted the depreciation provision, 12 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.022" offset="3063411">Repeatedly, Congress addressed itself in these 12 Revenue Acts and Codes to the problem of how depreciation on business asset and capital gain or loss on its disposition should work.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.366" offset="3124851">Again and again, Congress changed the treatment of gain or loss in 1921, '32, '38, '42, '47, '50, '51, '54, '62 and '64.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.770" offset="3178454">Again and again, focusing on the problem we have here, but again and again, in each of the 12 enactments and each of it's addresses to the problem, it left the depreciation provision that the Commissioner had always interpreted as allowing year of sale depreciation totally unchanged, the basic depreciation words today, except for the inclusion of the word obsolescence, are exactly what they were in the Revenue Act of 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.987" offset="3319306">Suddenly, so as far as I can determine, sometime in 1960, the Commissioner privately determine that he would like to wipe the slate clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.118" offset="3355878">He didn't tell us this until 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.565" offset="3365595">In June of that year, he published a Revenue Ruling that stated that now he did not want to allow depreciation for the year of profitable sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.349" offset="3408750">But since our case was docketed in the Tax Court late in 1960 and from such other evidence as I can find, 1960 or about the middle of 1960 was the time of the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.496" offset="3465383">Now, when this change occurred in 1960, there were no cases in the Courts involving this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.658" offset="3490043">Now there are more than 300.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.884" offset="3502895">The Commissioner tries in his brief to say that this is an old policies following, and not a new policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.380" offset="3528913">But I think it's enough to tell you that there were no cases in 1960 and there are over 300 now.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.153" offset="3555976">This speaks for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.051" offset="3583561">The Commissioner has only one excuse for this extraordinary course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.768" offset="3602474">He says that over the first 47 years of the modern income tax, he didn't really focus on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.054" offset="3627551">He is --</text>

            <label>Mr. James B. Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="883.230" offset="3636328">He did not focus on the issue for the first 47 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.862" offset="3650853">He is dissatisfied, Mr. Chief Justice, with the quality of his eyesight for 47 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.293" offset="3672586">Now he says in 1960's, “eyes cleared”, and we have three replies to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.161" offset="3704038">First, you cannot read the authorities we have cited without being convinced that the focus was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.260" offset="3744371">We have quoted in our briefs portions of most penetrating analysis from these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.795" offset="3774568">This Court's 1927 decision in Ludey contains the classic statement of the purpose of depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.495" offset="3809364">The Tax Courts early cases are equally penetrating.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.866" offset="3826813">The Commissioner's published rulings not only state that depreciation is allowable in the year of sale, they tell us why.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.522" offset="3861504">Secondly, the Commissioner cannot excuse 47 years of administrative practice, published rulings, court decisions, congressional re-enactment, committee reports, regulations, and equity essences in court decisions on the ground that his eyesight wasn't good.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.429" offset="3945096">He cannot just wave the magic wand of shortsightedness and dismiss what otherwise obviously has produced a rule of law that he can no longer change.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.308" offset="4004655">But our third answer is the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.335" offset="4016671">And that is that his ability to focus did not improve in 1960, unfortunately, it declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.317" offset="4056691">His new position will not stand up on their analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.390" offset="4080933">His position for 47 years stands up handily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.022" offset="4103502">What he is now attempting to do is to scrap the basic function of depreciation which is the allocation of the original cost of an asset in a reasonable manner over the elements of income or loss that it will produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.682" offset="4178108">You've got to fragment its cost just as though you were buying a land and building, affixed non-depreciable asset and the depreciable asset or as though you were buying land and supporting standing timber again on the basis of the facts existing at the time of purchase, you've got to determine how many of the dollars you laid out must be considered the cost of the land, and how many the cost of the timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.656" offset="4290017">Similarly, this taxpayer when it bought the ship but two assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.577" offset="4381654">And just as you have to divide the original cost on some reasonable basis between the building and the land or the timber and the land, so it had to be divided here between the depreciable asset, the use of the ship as a tramp steamer and the non-depreciable asset, the use of the ship for scrap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.512" offset="4473396">This is the ruling there, so we have no argument here about the correctness of the original determinations of salvage value and the balance of cost that's depreciable over the useful life because the ruling fixed that and the Commissioner does not repudiate the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.463" offset="4549256">We do not have the problem that was presented in Massey, the Massey and Hertz cases here in which the taxpayers have taken -- had made bad estimates, but we have approved estimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.247" offset="4604322">The Commissioner's says however that the estimates are merely provisional that the minute you determine what the actual period of holding is and what the actual sales price is, then you must abandon the provisional estimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.229" offset="4660328">You must abandon the temporary estimates because now you have the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.366" offset="4676838">Now, you know how long the asset was used and what it was sold for, and these automatically supplant the determinations made at the time of purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.873" offset="4718843">Our answer to this is that the ship that was sold in December of 1957 is not the same ship that was bought in December of 1955, nor indeed was the same ship that existed on January 1 of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.527" offset="4785507">In 1927, Justice Brandeis said in the Ludey case when the plant has disposed off after years of use, the thing then sold is not the whole thing originally acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.664" offset="4826049">Therefore, you cannot match the cost of what was acquired a greater -- the cost of a greater asset against the sales price of a different asset, a lesser asset that it is sold later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.157" offset="4875995">The Commissioner disregards that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.732" offset="4882265">He wants to match the cost of the greater asset that existed on January 1, 1957 against the sale price received for the lesser asset in December of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.908" offset="4926986">And since the sale price received for the lesser asset, absorbs the cost of the greater asset, this is well during inflationary periods, he says the asset used up during the year costs nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.904" offset="4979022">This is nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.554" offset="4985605">Obviously, the taxpayer did not get that the 1957 use of its ship for nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.786" offset="5126562">He would be unwilling to allow increased depreciation for the year of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.843" offset="5146728">He takes an approach of ‘heads, I win - tails, you lose'.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.139" offset="5167940">His approach however cannot be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.485" offset="5185285">Obviously, if the original determination of useful life and salvage value are purely provisional that they must yield to the facts as soon as the facts are known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.464" offset="5225200">This is just as true for a sale at a loss as it is for a sale of a gain, and therefore, he cannot hold the line against the loss situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.627" offset="5273893">Now, what happened is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.858" offset="5282774">In 1962 and 1964, Congress cured his problem as to sales that he gained completely as to personal property, and in very substantial part as to real property by providing that upon the sale, the depreciation taken not only in the year of sale, but all during the life of the property must first be applied against the gain and recaptured as ordinary income, and only the balance of profit, if any, can be capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.587" offset="5425716">As I say, this is wholly true for personalty and partly true for realty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.740" offset="5458317">The loss situation however remains open for exploitation and that there is no answer for the Commissioner to say that sales at a loss are ordinarily ordinary losses because very, very frequently they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.842" offset="5522787">Often they are capital losses from one of two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.155" offset="5535953">They may have to be matched against gain on the sale of other types of assets, for example, a vacant land or the asset being sold may not be a business asset but an asset that I simply hold for the production of income, although I'm a lawyer, I may have a house that I am renting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.553" offset="5605543">And there, I have to take a capital loss, just as the Commissioner contended recently that the owner of a resource had to take and contended successfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.696" offset="5654131">Thirdly, lots of losses cannot be taken at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.596" offset="5665729">If I trade-in my old business car on a new business car, I am denied any loss at all, it's nonrecognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.875" offset="5694882">And the Code has a long list, 15 or 20 nonrecognition provisions that we could examine in this connection and apply to what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.744" offset="5730304">Now, if the Commissioner is right, why has Congress denied recognition of losses for depreciable property?</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.459" offset="5757158">And why has Congress provided that losses on sale of depreciable property under various circumstances shall be capital losses?</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.531" offset="5789445">Because there are no such losses, the Commissioner now contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.866" offset="5810866">If the original estimates must yield to the actual sales price, losses from sales of depreciable property are wiped out, this great complex of Code provisions become meaningless and Congress is struggled with the loss problem in the 1938 Act, and then the 1942 Act, and then 1962, and then 1964, puts legislation in a vacuum, legislation on a non-existent problem if we believe what the Commissioner now says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.867" offset="5938866">I will close by reading two sentences from the Commissioner's brief before this Court in the Massey case in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.471" offset="5993305">If, as the Commissioner contends, the depreciation deduction must be based upon a rate determined by the period during which the asset can reasonably be expected to be used in the taxpayer's business, and their reasonable estimate of salvage value at the end of that period, there will be no conversion of ordinary income into a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.163" offset="6087973">Ordinary and predictable salvage value, determined as of the time that sale of the asset is contemplated will impose a realistic ceiling upon depreciation claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.133" offset="6139904">This court read the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.458" offset="6153174">It decided its Massey decision on the basis of that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.462" offset="6173236">The basis of that decision is what the Commissioner now asks this Court to overthrow.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.469" offset="6249200">Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.434" offset="6265083">Well, I would like very much to spend the majority of my argument, as Mr. Lewis has not, on the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.099" offset="6295803">I recognized that although I have in my brief dealt at length with his re-enactment argument, I should also discuss it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.310" offset="6332583">Let me first state, as I see it, the issue on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.280" offset="6352541">And then, deal specifically with his re-enactment argument which does not go to the merits of the Commissioner's position, but whether Congress has precluded the Commissioner from taking his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.109" offset="6411786">In 1955, the petitioner purchased a ship for $470,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.478" offset="6449298">In December 1957, it sold that ship for approximately $700,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.015" offset="6483466">That is for $230,000 more than it originally paid for the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.897" offset="6510947">Now the question on the merits for this Court is whether that the petitioner is entitled to take $135,000 deduction for depreciation in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.024" offset="6571447">That is the year in which it had already sold the ship for more than it originally he paid for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.913" offset="6595062">The Government's position in short is that since at the end of 1957, petitioner knew that the ship, that the use of the ship, had not cost at anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.695" offset="6650128">It was not entitled to take a depreciation deduction for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.408" offset="6673011">We believe that petitioner should not be able to intentionally distort its income by deducting a $135,000 cost which it knows it will never incur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.801" offset="6734555">I think that the difference between the petitioner's view and ours goes to the essence of the depreciation deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.136" offset="6775933">We believe that the depreciation deduction is there like all the other deductions in the Code in order to permit the taxpayer to deduct against his income, the costs of earning the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.785" offset="6838523">And that is it not entitled, the petitioner like any other taxpayer, is not entitled to deduct the cost which it will not incur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.803" offset="6874572">Of course, the depreciation deduction computed as it frequently is before the events must take into account estimates as to future events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.657" offset="6918040">However, once those future events have occurred and the actual facts are known, we contend that thereafter, and only thereafter, the petitioner is required to take cognizance of reality and not to ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.219" offset="6988257">The regulations, which we believe are clearly authorized by the Code provision being interpreted and which the petitioner has not challenge, state specifically that the reasonableness of each year's allowance for depreciation shall be judged in terms of the conditions known to exist at the end of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.329" offset="7088671">In other words, when you seek to compute your depreciation deduction in December of a given year, the last day of the year, you will judge the reasonableness of that deduction in light of the facts that are known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.158" offset="7148022">Now, I will diverge for a moment from the argument on the merits in order to answer the re-enactment argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.336" offset="7608717">Even if, at the beginning of the second year of use, he could have sold the machine for $20,000, but that because he held it until the end of the year, he was able to sell it for only $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.306" offset="7668590">In other words, if an item doesn't costs a taxpayer anything an out of pocket money, he is not entitled to a deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2041.049" offset="8267525">In other words, the taxpayer came in and he said to the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.176" offset="8280064">“I bought a ship and I paid $470,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.443" offset="8293125">I think it's going to -- I think I'm going to use the ship for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.335" offset="8308694">And at the end of that period, I believe I will be able to sell it for scrap steel for $50,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.732" offset="8346311">And I would like to write that off over the straight-line method over three years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.254" offset="8364387">And the Internal Revenue Service said, and on a letter to the taxpayer, we referred to as a letter ruling, it said, “On the face of it, these things look alright to us now.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.065" offset="8403675">However, the Internal Revenue Service specifically said as we quote on page 2 of our brief, that this letter does not constitute a binding agreement under Code Section 167 (d) which sets up a system under which binding agreements maybe made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.668" offset="8462085">But I might note parenthetically that even under Section 167 (d), if the facts change, the ruling is no longer valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.371" offset="8488835">And the Internal Revenue Service went on to state that the ruling was subject to such change in the event of subsequent experience should be different than expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.559" offset="8521644">So I think that disposes of the ruling as being binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.771" offset="8542438">In other words, basis of the facts as they existed in 1955 when this ship was acquired, that the Internal Revenue Service agrees with the petitioner that at that time, it's seemed reasonable that the ship would cost the taxpayer $420,000 to use it for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.157" offset="8607953">Now Mr. Justice Fortas, an answer to your question, that taxpayers started out, and in the first year, it took a depreciation deduction based on those assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.962" offset="8651212">But by the end of 1957, he knew that the ship was not going to cost him $420,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.505" offset="8677439">He knew in fact that the ship had not cost him anything to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.908" offset="8691022">Now, he'd already had depreciation deductions for 1955 for a month or so, and for the entire year 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.627" offset="8721847">The Commissioner does not seek to go back and reopen those deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.067" offset="8735640">In fact, the precedents would preclude the Commissioner, I think wisely so from doing that, because if the depreciation deduction was reasonable in light of the facts existing at the end of 1955 and the end of 1966, in light of the facts than existing, the Commissioner under the annual accounting system would not seek to reopen those facts as this Court said in (Inaudible) --</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.771" offset="10714467">And that this -- this taxpayer didn't expect to sell the asset was because, I contend, that this Court recognized that depreciation was an inherently realistic attempt to allow the taxpayer to write off over his actual period of use, his actual cost for the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.482" offset="10793253">And this Court said that at the beginning when you first acquire it, you must take realistic estimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.363" offset="10816867">How long do you really expect to use it and what you really expect to receive for it at the end, write off that realistically estimated net cost over your realistic period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.969" offset="10887293">We are saying in the year when the taxpayer finds out that the facts are different than he estimated at the beginning, if he has found out that he has written off the entire cost of his asset, he may not then take an additional cost, an unrealistic cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.508" offset="11229393">In the first place, if a taxpayer buys an asset for a $100,000 and he figures he's going to use it for five years and he writes it off that he won't receive anything for it when it's all done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.345" offset="11272756">He writes it off, $20,000 a year for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.193" offset="11284146">Near the end of the fifth year, a war breaks out, an international crisis or some kind, and this machine we're talking about here, cannot be replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.788" offset="11314552">He ends up using it, let's assume, another five years, it's quite clear that he doesn't get any additional depreciation for the remaining five years he used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.867" offset="11350810">And the reason is because, he's written off his entire cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.956" offset="11367215">Now, we contend that the purpose of depreciation is the eminently realistic one of allowing a taxpayer to write off, not his entire cost of the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.762" offset="11410369">This Courts decisions in Massey and Hertz make come quite clear, that it's not intended to let you write off your entire cost of an asset, but just the cost you will actually incur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.639" offset="11449971">That is your original cost less your salvage value or resale price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.568" offset="11469615">Now, once this taxpayer knew, which he did at the end of 1957, that this asset hadn't cost him a penny, I believe he was in exactly the same position if the taxpayer would have written off his entire cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.032" offset="11519457">He knew he'd written off more than the asset cost because he got a $142,000 worth of depreciation in the previous two years and the asset hadn't cost him anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.329" offset="11556655">We think that to allow him to intentionally take depreciation that he knows he will never incur, it would distort his income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.723" offset="11594271">We don't believe that depreciation was ever intended to serve his function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.039" offset="11611512">When Congress enacted the allowance for depreciation, it said that a taxpayer should be allowed a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.597" offset="11641710">Vague words, admittedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.183" offset="11648084">It then went on to say that the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate would have authority to issue regulations and it -- depreciation would be computed in accordance with those regulations, that's Section 167 (b) of the Code cited in our Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.032" offset="11719450">Now we contend two things -- first, that the regulation specifically covered this case, not in so many words but the concepts in the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.591" offset="11757693">And second, that to the extent the regulations covered this case, they make sense, they are reasonable and they are in accord with the statutory purpose, as it's evident on the face the depreciation statute, and as it's evident from this Courts decision in Massey and Hertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.356" offset="11816835">The regulations -- and I'll state a couple of points and regulations very briefly, say first of all that the reasonableness of each year's depreciation deduction shall be judged on the basis of the conditions known to exist at the end of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.870" offset="11870856">Now, what sense would there be in judging the reasonableness of the year's depreciation deduction, say five years after the asset was purchased, if not to see whether they were reasonable in light of writing off what this taxpayer knew or reasonably expected to be his cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.692" offset="11934177">Second, the regulations specifically state that no asset shall be depreciated below a reasonable salvage or resale value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.106" offset="11967822">Now, we think that regulation itself is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.786" offset="11978480">And third, the regulations give examples, instances we believe as I answered Mr. Justice White's question, where depreciation deductions -- depreciation formula will be recomputed and the salvage value or resale price will be recomputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.866" offset="12038875">They don't say that it will be in this case where you actually sell the asset, but we believe that the -- that it's a clear inference that whenever it's necessary in order to accurately take a reasonable allowance for depreciation, you must make that effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.278" offset="12100524">Now, I would like at this time to answer specifically Mr. Lewis' argument regarding the loss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.807" offset="12134588">He says, “This is a gain case, what about the loss case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.283" offset="12144515">The same thing applies and it doesn't make sense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.374" offset="12156844">Now, we didn't answer that in our brief and so I'd like to answer it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.340" offset="12168756">He makes at point one of his reply brief, Mr. Lewis argues that by parity of reasoning and if this Court holds that once a taxpayer -- once a taxpayer has taken all the depreciation he's entitled to, which is what we're arguing here, then he's not entitled to anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.218" offset="12244198">And if this Court holds that, then therefore this Court must also be saying that if the taxpayer sold an asset at a tremendous loss, then he must be entitled to take that entire loss as additional depreciation in the year of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.008" offset="12295398">We don't believe that this necessarily follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.987" offset="12467284">Certainly, after this Court makes its decision, the Commissioner may well have an opportunity to reexamine his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.588" offset="12493720">I don't suggest he's going to change his mind on it, but he'll have a chance to reexamine it, he'll have an opportunity to issue rulings or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.345" offset="12532799">As this Court said in the Lake case, P. G. Lake Case, they said the Commissioner can exercise his continuing rulemaking power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.651" offset="12566026">Now once this -- that case has been decided, once the gain case has been decided, if the Commissioner then decides that the loss case should go the other way, I think there may well be reason for it to go the other way, as I'll state in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.999" offset="12619316">The statutory test of course is a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.219" offset="12640214">If a taxpayer buys an asset for a $100,000 and it depreciates at the rate of $10,000 a year for two years, so he's got an $80,000 un-depreciated basis in that asset, and then he sells that --</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.409" offset="12697057">Yes, a ten-year life and no salvage value, let's say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.622" offset="12705834">So he starts out with asset that he pays a $100,000 and he takes $10,000 depreciation at the first year, and the second year, he's got $80,000.00 un-depreciated cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.543" offset="12741569">Then all of a sudden, by the end of the third year, he sells that asset for $10,000 -- it may well be that $70,000 is not in the statutory words, are reasonable allowance for depreciation for that third year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.720" offset="12806248">On the other hand, we contend that if the taxpayer at the end of that third year sold the asset for $120,000, it's very clear that's this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.199" offset="12848149">It's very clear that no deduction for depreciation would be reasonable and that any deduction for depreciation would be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.880" offset="12886915">But, the statutory test on reasonable allowance for depreciation doesn't necessarily apply to the gain case and exactly the same way that it applies to the loss case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.745" offset="12926307">As Mr. Lewis phrase it, he said, “Heads, we win.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.670" offset="12942085">Tails, you lose,” I don't think this is as easy as flipping a coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.932" offset="12959117">I think that this is case that -- the loss case, is not determinant of the gain case, I don't think the Government has to explain how it's going to treat the loss case or decide that now.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="3225.526" offset="13005511">Mr. Levin, Mr. Lewis is very precise about what the administrative interpretation has been from 1913 up to 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.041" offset="13059532">What is your answer to that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack S. Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="3240.733" offset="13066324">I'll take the issue with this interpretation, Your Honor, I'll state it very briefly here but it's contained a great length in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.641" offset="13101955">First of all, it's quite clear that during a large percentage of the eras from 1939, it made no tax difference in the world whether depreciation was allowed in the year of sale or not because the vast majority of the case as cited by Mr. Lewis are cases where the taxpayer received ordinary income on his sale of the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.614" offset="13197876">That meant that if he took a depreciation, let's say of $135,000 in the year he sold the asset, that reduced his operating income by $135,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.678" offset="13234134">Since that reduced the basis of his asset by $135,000, it increased his gain on the asset by a $135,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.870" offset="13258898">If that gain was taxed to his ordinary income, then all he did is take a $135,000 of operating income and put it into gain on the asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.418" offset="13297037">And both were taxed exactly the same way, his ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.196" offset="13312188">Thus, the Commissioner would have been laughed out at the court if he'd brought a case and said, “Well, this taxpayer put the $135,000 worth of income in the wrong place on his return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.579" offset="13349700">But the tax result is just the same.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.660" offset="13358059">Mr. Lewis cited the Ludey case, decided by this Court in 1927, the Crane case decided in 1947, and he mentioned another case in 1921, all three of those cases related to years in which it made no difference whatsoever how you computed the allowance for depreciation, and that's why the Commissioner didn't focus on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.616" offset="13445831">I admit that there were approximately, I believe, eight cases according to Mr. Lewis' own brief, his reply brief, approximately eight cases during the entire history of the Internal Revenue Code in which it would've made a difference and in which the Commissioner didn't seek to disallow the depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.452" offset="13509151">But there was no focus whatsoever on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.989" offset="13519287">These cases came shortly after the change in the Code had made the -- had made the gain on an asset, capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.400" offset="13564949">They came at a time when the Commissioner was seeking to lay down the basic ground rules of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.134" offset="13583862">They all involve cases such as whether depreciation was allowable at all on a given type of asset rather than how you -- exactly, how under my new way you compute depreciation from what date to what date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.277" offset="13632449">They involved broad-sweeping questions and sometimes on constitutional issues such as whether in the given case, depreciation should be computed on the basis of the cost of the asset or its value on March 1, 1913 when the Code was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.198" offset="13688142">All of those cases involved other issues, complex issues and neither the courts nor the Commissioner focused on it and it's the --</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.068" offset="13719594">When did the tax structure first bring this problem into focus?</text>

          <turn speaker="jack_s_levin" startTime="3409.819" stopTime="3679.175">
            <label>Mr. Jack S. Levin</label>
            <text syncTime="3409.819" offset="13742686">There was some capital gain on assets beginning in the year 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.257" offset="13764420">However many of the cases decided after that here concerned previous years for another eight or nine years at least that litigation concerned pre-1921 years, in which no one had ever heard of capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.114" offset="13819800">Moreover, even after 1921, there was a capital gain in only some assets and the vast majority of the cases cited by Mr. Lewis dealing with those later years also concern cases in which the particular asset involved produced ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.064" offset="13875597">Now in 1938, Congress repealed capital gain for depreciable assets altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.380" offset="13900884">And from 1938 to 1942, there was no capital gain on the depreciable asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.591" offset="13917706">Thus, every case involving depreciable assets -- this issue was mooted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.795" offset="13938604">That's the era out which the Crane case grew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.903" offset="13950934">Now immediately after or shortly after 1942, when this issue again became revitalized by virtue of the change in the statute in 1942 giving capital gain on the sale with depreciable assets, the Commissioner began to focus on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.187" offset="14016136">The Commissioner disallowed year of sale depreciation in two cases that we discussed at length in our brief, one involving 1942 depreciation itself, the first year after the change in law, another involving 1944 depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.950" offset="14079143">Now, I'm frank to admit that the Commissioner probably did not instruct his thousand of agents to go out and seek out cases, somehow, these two arouse, and the Commissioner disallowed the depreciation -- 1942 and 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.478" offset="14125328">Those cases were hardly litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.359" offset="14136822">The 1942 case, the Weir Long Leaf case resulted in a confusing decision of the court, somehow upholding the Commissioner on part of the assets and not upholding him on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.921" offset="14179035">We can argue over whether those issues are reconcilable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.669" offset="14190007">I don't think they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.865" offset="14194813">But one thing is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.160" offset="14200038">The Commissioner had taken the position that the depreciation should be disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.991" offset="14215293">The other case finally went up to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.932" offset="14227101">That's the case involving 1944 depreciation and the Commissioner won the case, that's the Cohn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.095" offset="14251760">Now, after winning the Cohn case, the Commissioner then issued a Revenue Ruling which specifically stated the principles that we are here relying upon for broad application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.043" offset="14299512">And then I'm sure Revenue agents all over the country somehow got wind that this was an important issue, and now there are approximately 300 or 400 cases pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.080" offset="14331695">We did not believe that the Commissioner's failure to focus upon or consider the issue precludes him from first raising it in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.022" offset="14371506">In fact in a 1927 case, which I mentioned only because -- not because the issue was really genuinely focused -- in a 1927 case mentioned by Mr. Lewis in his oral argument, the Commissioner disallowed depreciation in the year of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.834" offset="14426676">The court held against him, but he had disallowed the depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.968" offset="14447261">And again, it was not raised again by the Commissioner until 1942 depreciation came into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.876" offset="14474846">But in essence, before I sit down, let me just say that we contend first, that the Commissioner is not precluded by the re-enactment doctrine, we don't think the Commissioners failure to raise the issue for a few years really came to the attention of the Congress or can be deemed by this Court in light of the precedents cited and quoted in our brief to have caused the Congress to make a considered determination that a reasonable allowance for depreciation should not be interpreted as the Commissioner now interprets it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.038" offset="14591561">Certainly, the Congress didn't consider this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.714" offset="14598248">In fact, the only congressional reference to it was in 1964 committee reports where the Congress specifically said that it did not intend to overturn the holding of the Second Circuit in the other cases, which went in the favor of the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.643" offset="14665958">The Congress said that in the 1964 committee report and that's quoted in our brief as well.Second, we contend that once this Court reaches the issue on the merits, that the result should be in favor of the Commissioner because the whole history and purpose of depreciation as well as the regulations make it quite clear that a taxpayer should not knowingly be allowed to deduct a cost he knows he will never incur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.503" offset="14777344">We think it would intentionally distort his income and we contend that it would not be reasonable allowance for depreciation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3686.364" offset="14848815">I agree that we have the other question of what is a reasonable allowance for depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.064" offset="14875669">What does petitioner had on January 1, 1957 was two assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.288" offset="14900537">He had the use of the ship for scrap, a potential use for scrap on which the parties agree -- to which the parties agree $54,000 of the costs should be allocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.435" offset="14953096">He had the predicted two remaining years of use as a cargo carrier based on a determination that both parties also agree on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.687" offset="14998131">And the balance of his cost $270,000 must have been the cost of what he was going to use after that two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.247" offset="15028328">He consumed one of the two years and then he sold to a competitor the right to use the vessel for the second of the two years plus the scrap value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.333" offset="15072737">The petitioner took the $270,000 of remaining cost fairly attributable to the usefulness of the vessel as a cargo carrier and applied half of it against the 1957 year he used up, and he applied half against the 1958, year of you see it sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.440" offset="15157164">The Commissioner says, “No, zero to 57th year of use, $270,000 to the 58th year of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.811" offset="15186631">That cost you $270,000, 1957 cost you nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.456" offset="15209200">Now, which is reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.596" offset="15217768">Take one case just to focus on the issue.Suppose that I own a patent that I had purchased and it has two years to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.903" offset="15258937">And I have under a fair allocation of cost set up by a ruling, $270,000 of un-recovered cost and I have two years to go, and then it's worth zero, absolutely worth zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.184" offset="15324139">Which should I do if I use one year, if I consume ‘57 and get the ‘57 royalties, make money for ‘57 and then sell the to you the right to receive the ‘58 royalties, shall I apply $135,000 to ‘57 and $135,000 to 58?</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.930" offset="15395088">Is that reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.599" offset="15401775">Or is this reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.576" offset="15405641">Zero, $270,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.116" offset="15419852">Now the Commissioner gets there by inventing an argument that's utterly circular, utterly unsupported, he's made it up as though this were field of pure reason, no history, and he says, “History is not on the merits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.807" offset="15478575">And then having ventured into this field of pure reason, he reasons so badly that you get this preposterous result of one year costing nothing and the second here costing everything, nothing could be more unreasonable than that.</text>
