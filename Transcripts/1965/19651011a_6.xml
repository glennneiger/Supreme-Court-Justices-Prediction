            <label>Mr. Ronald L. Goldfarb</label>
            <text syncTime="13.005" offset="155355">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.175" offset="168103">This case presented the Court with the opportunity to deal with two important and quite disputed, specially recently quite disputed areas in the law of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.262" offset="208436">They are first the procedures governing Grand Jury contempts and particularly Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures and secondly, the right to trial by a jury for criminal contempts when the sentences are severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.618" offset="269876">Before dealing with these two subjects, I would like to briefly summarize the facts which gave rise to this contempt conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.903" offset="299029">In July of 1963, the petitioner was subpoenaed to appear before a Grand Jury of the South District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.677" offset="330062">His subpoena specified that the Grand Jury was investigating under the general conspiracy, criminal conspiracy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.388" offset="360887">He appeared, answered certain preliminary questions and then refused to answer a group of questions invoking his privilege under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.185" offset="400071">The government counsel offered petitioner immunity under Title 47 of the U.S. Code, the Federal Communications Act, the petitioner nonetheless refused to answer the questions and continued to invoke his privilege under the Fifth Amendment, whereupon he was asked to leave the Grand Jury room, the District Court Judge was brought in and his aid and assistance was sought by the government counsel for the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.646" offset="525981">The judge was not certain whether or not he could in fact give the immunity under the circumstances of the case and adjourned till the next day, advising the petitioner that he should come at that time with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.756" offset="574360">On the following day, the petitioner appeared in the courtroom before the judge and government counsel without the Grand Jury and after some colloquy in which the counsel for the petitioner expressed some reluctance to appear and stated that he wasn't quite ready, the judge dismissed the proceeding because he felt at that time that he couldn't truly give the immunity that the government counsel had spoken of.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.382" offset="684910">A week later, in August of 1963, the petitioner was subpoenaed again and appeared again and appeared before the same Grand Jury and the same government counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.277" offset="724511">Under the subpoena which this time mentioned an investigation into Title 47 of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.029" offset="751470">Again he was asked a series of questions, some of which were essentially the same as he had already been asked a week before and some of them were a continuation of those questions and again, refused invoking his privilege against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.455" offset="813223">At this point, he was taken with the Grand Jury by the government counsel before the Court and the Court's aid and assistance was again requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.102" offset="851780">The judge again discussed with counsel whether counsel was prepared to undertake this case and the counsel was quite reluctant to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.289" offset="888560">The judge again not certain whether or not he could invoke or whether or not he could in fact give immunity under Title 47 adjourned the proceedings, so that he could read the transcript of a case which was he felt dispositive of his power in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.680" offset="962121">The following morning, the judge, Grand Jury and lawyers again reassembled in the Grand Jury room, which was specifically stated in the record as being used an extension of the Grand Jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.488" offset="1009351">The judge at this point ordered the petitioner to answer the questions that had been put to him before the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.244" offset="1036309">Then the judge and the petitioner's counsel left the courtroom and he was re-asked the questions by the government counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.184" offset="1064103">Again, he refused to answer the questions, at this point completing his contempt of court if any there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.938" offset="1099107">After he was asked the questions and again refused to answer under the Fifth Amendment grounds, the judge and the petitioner's counsel came back into the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.644" offset="1133902">They were appraised by the government counsel of what had happened, what had ensued while they were out and again the government counsel asked the Court to order to witness to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.343" offset="1172773">At this point, at the request of the government counsel, the Court put the witness on the stand, swore the witness with the Grand Jury present, with the government counsel present and still somewhat reluctant petitioner's counsel present, re-asked him the same questions, advised him that he would not consider his Fifth Amendment defense because he was giving him immunity, asked him if he understood that, petitioner nonetheless respectfully declined to answer on the grounds that he felt he could be -- he would be incriminating himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.730" offset="1302340">At this point, the government asked the Court to proceed under Rule 42(a) and find the petitioner in contempt in the presence of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.794" offset="1346539">At this point, the petitioner's counsel who had been lead to believe in the prior proceedings that he would not necessarily be involved in a contempt proceeding, rose and said, and I would like to now refer to page 32 and 33 of the transcript, because on this page-and-a-half is an example of startlingly summary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.968" offset="1439222">What petitioner will urge is, is the very reason why Rule 42(a) should not apply in cases like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.510" offset="1469419">At this point, we pick up in the middle of page 32, we find the judge and the petitioner's counsel having come back into the courtroom after the witness had been ordered to testify and had refused and at this point, had committed his contempt of court if there was one.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.614" offset="1537860">The Court says after directing the witness to testify again at the request of the government counsel, anything further, the government counsel said no and requested the Court to proceed under Rule 42(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="370.631" offset="1585925">At this point, the petitioner's counsel said “Your Honor, if this is a contempt proceeding, I respectfully request an adjournment.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.605" offset="1613824">I want to have the minutes and I want to have an opportunity to discuss them and consider them with my client and look up the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.601" offset="1641827">I further request Your Honor a hearing where I will be permitted to call witnesses, perhaps a Grand Juror too, perhaps the places where the phone calls allegedly were made”.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.482" offset="1677249">He goes on to discuss possible violation under the Communications Act and whether or not it was truly appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.183" offset="1704103">He said “I haven't been told that there is any tariff that's been violated, no law has been cited to me and I would also request that the proceeding be held in public” and here we have in the Court's response, the complete adjudication in this case of a man's guilt of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.588" offset="1761677">Your request is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.496" offset="1769305">This is a contempt committed in open court and I adjudge the defendant guilty of a criminal contempt under Rule 42(a), that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.745" offset="1802324">Further down in the page, there is an equally summary sentencing procedure in which after the first -- the adjudication of contempt by the Court, the counsel said “But Your Honor, this is not open to the -- is this open to the public?</text>
            <text syncTime="441.373" offset="1868884">This rule has been sealed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="442.896" offset="1874944">The Court said, “No, we opened a few minutes ago.”</text>
            <text syncTime="445.508" offset="1885393">Well, I will get to that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.790" offset="1902529">Then he follows by saying that “I adjudge Mr. Harris guilty of contempt of court and sentence him to imprisonment for a term of one year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="458.167" offset="1936071">This was the complete adjudication and sentencing of an individual to prison for one year.</text>

          <turn speaker="ronald_l_goldfarb" startTime="473.514" stopTime="531.332">
            <label>Mr. Ronald L. Goldfarb</label>
            <text syncTime="473.514" offset="1997406">Yes indeed Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.038" offset="2003571">Later on when there was a discussion about bail, which by the way is not so far as I can -- so far as Rule 42(a) states, it is confined to Rule 42(b) and not 42(a), but nonetheless when they did discuss bail, the judge said that he would consider if the witness testified in the future, a motion to reconsider the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.764" offset="2094477">With regard to that, I might point out to the Court the opinion of this Court in one of the Gompers cases, I believe it's 233 U.S., in which this Court has held that a statement -- a gratuitous statement like this does not in anyway convert a criminal contempt to a civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.376" offset="2172844">Although the government argues that it makes it in the nature of a more coercive contempt that we are dealing in this case and the judge specifically states the different points in the record that this is a criminal contempt.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="531.332" stopTime="535.875">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="538.608" stopTime="542.999">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="538.608" offset="2257795">Well, you even make a point of the fact that the courtroom was closed here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_l_goldfarb" startTime="542.999" stopTime="975.059">
            <label>Mr. Ronald L. Goldfarb</label>
            <text syncTime="542.999" offset="2275349">Your Honor, the record as I interpret it indicates that this proceeding was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.513" offset="2305442">The lower court and the Court of Appeals found that it was an open proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.314" offset="2324668">I can only suggest to Your Honor that a complete scrutiny of the record indicates only two places where it could possibly be a basis for finding that it was open.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.094" offset="2363747">One, in the statement of the judge, which is part of his adjudication, your request is denied, this is contempt committed in open court, but this came right after they came walking in through the doors, it could only have been moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.710" offset="2418186">And certainly when the Grand Jury was there and he was being asked the questions by the government counsel, it could not have been an open proceeding, it was a Grand Jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.120" offset="2447862">So there is in the record only this statement by the Court, this is open.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.444" offset="2469177">And then later on, he says in response to the accusation that it was -- the doors were sealed, well I opened it a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.761" offset="2502405">There is also in the record a -- I believe it's on page 60 of the record, a docket entry or a minute record of the clerk, it can found at page 60 of the record, indicating that in the title of the case, and this is a formal paper that's filled in by the clerk of the court each day, it says the Court meets and is opened by a proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.437" offset="2593102">Well, the record of that proceeding shows no proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.576" offset="2613687">The most I should think can be said for the openness of this proceeding is that if it was, it was the most technical opening and indeed the record indicates that it really wasn't an open proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.190" offset="2668126">Indeed it could be argued that this kind of question about whether or not it was truly open underscores the very complaint that the petitioner has and others have had with Rule 42(a), in that the proceedings moved so swiftly that in this case no one could really have been there if they wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.363" offset="2752867">At the most, you could say it was a technical opening, but the record really argues against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.964" offset="2775228">Now the government argued in its brief that for anyone who was truly interested they would have known.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.187" offset="2796126">Well the government, the petitioner's counsel didn't even know.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.634" offset="2809919">He stood up in court and said “Your Honor the doors are sealed, this should be an open proceeding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="680.719" offset="2826219">Obviously, he wouldn't have said this if there were people in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.267" offset="2840430">For anyone who was a member, for example, if petitioner's family or anyone who was a member of the press or anyone who wanted to observe these proceedings, the only way they could have known would be if they were trying constantly to get in the door and at the moment the door was unsealed, which would have been after the judge and the petitioner's counsel came back in, if they kind of came through as he said the magic words, I refuse -- I deny your request, this is an open proceeding, but other than that, really I don't see how anybody could be in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.904" offset="2982954">In any event on April 19th of last year, 1964, this Court issued its decision in United States against Barnett.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.840" offset="3026735">In July of 1964, the Second Circuit affirmed the petitioner's conviction in sentence, noticing this Court's footnote in the Barnett case, but not conforming to it on the grounds that it was dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.402" offset="3076995">Petition of rehearing was later denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.805" offset="3086608">Petition for writ of certiorari was filed in September of 1964 and was granted in December of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.909" offset="3122970">With regard to Rule 42(a) and Rule 42(b), the petitioner's contention can be put very succinctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.849" offset="3162781">Rule 42(a) is an unusual proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.103" offset="3175737">It should be used in cases involving a disruption and a misbehavior in the presence of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.019" offset="3211473">The kinds of misconduct in the Court's view that might tend to moralize the Court or make it difficult for the Court to proceed truly the kind of misconduct, whereas Rule 42(b) applies in all other cases and specifically with regard to disobedience of the Court orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.593" offset="3285765">I suggest that a reading of Rule 42, a literal reading in any event makes this quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.950" offset="3311156">It starts by saying that summary proceedings under Rule 42(a) may be punished summarily if the judge certifies that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt that it was committed in the actual presence of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.212" offset="3380224">The use of the word may as this Court as already indicated, meaning that it isn't a word of command, but this is an alternative that the Court has, but when you have a Rule 42(b) case, the language becomes a language of command.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.623" offset="3437902">It says that in all other cases the contempt shall be prosecuted on notice and hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.928" offset="3463084">In this case, if there was a contempt, it was contempt after the Court had ordered the witness to testify in the courtroom and the witness had refused to.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.670" offset="3502059">That was a 42(b) case and under the rules of -- under the language of Rule 42(b), it shall be prosecuted upon notice and hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.531" offset="3545527">Now that could be also read in line with Rule 6 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure and I don't think that this Court did consider this.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.785" offset="3578546">It was not raised in the Brown or Levine cases, which so far govern this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.468" offset="3597249">Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure defines in very emphatic terms who may be present in Grand Jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.206" offset="3632149">Rule 6 states who may be present, (D) attorneys for the government maybe present, the witness under examination maybe present, interpreters when needed maybe present and a stenographer, but no other person than the jurors maybe present.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.703" offset="3694216">Now in this case, we have the unorthodox practice of the -- of petitioner's counsel being there at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.822" offset="3718666">We also have, but it could be argued that he did not object to this, but the point I make is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.398" offset="3744998">I question whether under Rule 6 it is proper for the judge to be in a Grand Jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.846" offset="3770807">Now under the rule of the Brown case, the trial court judge may convert what is a contempt in the presence of the Grand Jury without him into a contempt in his presence by asking, re-asking him the same question in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.386" offset="3836949">I suggest that under Rule 6, it would really be an illegality for there to be testimony in response to the Court's questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.744" offset="3878327">In other words I'm saying, the power of the judge to aid the Grand Jury does not in anyway change the independence of the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.188" offset="3912077">So that the Court can order the witness to testify, but he can order him to testify in the Grand Jury and not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.390" offset="3944887">So that I question whether or not the literal reading of Rule 6 might just undercut completely, the rule which has so far allowed under this Court's decision in Brown against the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.054" offset="4491577">If the Court does not want to go that far, the Court could distinguish this case because in Levine which followed the Brown case, the Court specifically said that the Levine case was a replica in every regard of the Brown case, except one, and in that case the argument was made in Levine that it wasn't a public proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.302" offset="4564616">The Court disposed of that by saying it was an afterthought and that petitioner hadn't raised it, but if he had it would have raised questions either under the Sixth Amendment's requirement for a public proceeding or the Fifth Amendment's requirement of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.107" offset="4619786">But the Court held in that case that it was not raised and that this is not that case, was the words of Justice Frankfurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.574" offset="4649671">If this Court does not want to overrule the Brown case, they could still overrule this conviction by saying that this indeed is that case, because the objection was timely raised in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.669" offset="4698049">In any event, the cases which lead up to the promulgation of Rule 42, particularly the ex parte Terry which was decided by former Justice Harlan in Cooke against the United States, an opinion by Mr. Chief Justice, former Chief Justice Taft, make it quite clear that 42(a) is reserved for misconduct and 42(b) is the general rule under which an individual should be proceeded against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.600" offset="4825736">When Mr. Justice Clark was Attorney General and this rule was passed, he urged in his preface to the promulgation of that rule that it be respected with the full measure of intent and spirit of the writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.124" offset="4879862">I suggest that the rule of the Brown case does not do that and that the Court should consider instead that if there is one word that might describe the procedures under Rule 42(a) in general and in this case in particular, that the word is not justice, the word is precipitous, the word is unfair and perhaps the word is unconstitutional.</text>
