            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 440, United States, Petitioner, versus Utah Construction and Mining Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.941" offset="251173">Mr. Jaffe.</text>

            <label>Mr. Irving Jaffe</label>
            <text syncTime="38.512" offset="257442">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.497" offset="273324">This case involves primarily two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.013" offset="291401">One deals with the scope of the disputes clause and that is whether or not that clause requires submission of all disputes concerning questions of fact to agency determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.371" offset="348871">We believe that that issue was not covered in the Bianchi decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.054" offset="367574">The second issue presented by this case is whether fact determinations concededly made by an agency under the disputes clause and concededly final under the Wunderlich Act, a binding on the parties and on the courts for all purposes or may the same facts be tried and determined de novo by the Court if deemed relevant to a breach of contract action allegedly outside the scope of the disputes clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.831" offset="478647">We believe that that issue has been decided by the Bianchi decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.226" offset="504247">The facts of this case are pertinent only to the extent that they illustrate the legal arguments that will be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.911" offset="534967">Suffice it to say that this case concerned a contract which was entered into in 1953 for the construction of an aircraft nuclear reactor project in the State of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.836" offset="590764">During the course of performance of this contract, several disputes arose, many of them were -- well, and they were submitted to the agency for determination, some were favorably acted upon, some unfavorably.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.525" offset="645517">Four of these disputes, all of which had been submitted to the agency before are in -- present in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.361" offset="680835">Each of those claims are presented in the same manner as they were presented administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.796" offset="706539">Two -- three of them at least include damages for delays.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.306" offset="724616">The fourth one was not conceded by the Board because it was deemed to be untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.675" offset="742066">That too was a claim for damages for delays.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.245" offset="760351">There is added in the petition however, an overall claim for delays damages allegedly resulting from the interaction of each of these four specific matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.496" offset="813328">Now, if we look at the disputes clause itself, we find that its language is apparently clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.023" offset="851466">The pertinent phrase of that clause says, “All disputes concerning questions of fact arising under this contract shall be decided by the contracting officer.”</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="199.233" stopTime="200.877">
            <label>Justice Tom C. Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="199.233" offset="900263">Where is that, do you have it in the record?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="irving_jaffe" startTime="200.877" stopTime="339.665">
            <label>Mr. Irving Jaffe</label>
            <text syncTime="200.877" offset="906846">We have that on page 3 of our brief or page 4 -- just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.870" offset="934849">It appears on page 6 of our brief, excuse me, on page 6 of our brief, subject to appeal and the decision shall be final.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.000" offset="983333">The Court of Claims however, in construing the phrase arising under the contract reads that clause as though it read all disputes concerning questions of fact arising under other clauses of this contract in which the granting of relief is specifically authorized shall be decided by the contracting officer, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.428" offset="1081135">I might also point out that the clause itself begins with the words except as otherwise specifically provided in this contract, all disputes shall be decided by the contracting officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.291" offset="1132544">The Court seemingly says, “Only as otherwise specified in this contract shall the contracting officer be authorized to decide disputes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="267.433" offset="1173086">We believe as a practical matter, certainly, the disputes clause ought to read in a manner in which the word says, that is all disputes arising under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.971" offset="1223241">This clause is the only one, as you will notice, which requires that the contracting -- the contractor shall proceed diligently with the work during the resolution of the dispute and until it is resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.126" offset="1275904">If -- as the Court of Claims contends, there are some disputes that are outside the scope of the disputes clause, there is no provision on the contract that would require the work to continue while the dispute was resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.124" offset="1327835">Conceivably, the contractor did say, that this dispute between me and you Mr. Contracting Officer is outside the scope of the disputes clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.221" offset="1360227">It's going to be costly for me to continue as you direct and since it's outside the clause, I'm going to stop working, go to court and find out which of us is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.109" offset="1395858">Now, the fact is that that has never been done, which I consider or at least I have no knowledge that it has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.851" offset="1422817">And I consider that a factor to show that the contractors themselves had never construed this clause as being limited only to certain types of disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.611" offset="1457821">But there's another reason --</text>

            <text syncTime="421.445" offset="1789158">I do suggest however that when the Court of Claims treated with this subject, they were treating with it under misconceptions of the law and in two circumstances the rationale that they used was rejected by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.532" offset="1841507">In other words, we do not have an ancient practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.648" offset="1853942">I think that we will show that the Bianchi decision itself is the first reason for the Court to focus on the arising under because prior to the Bianchi decision, the Court of Claims tried all cases de novo whether it was a breach of contract claim or whether it was an arising under claim as they conceive that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.172" offset="1936071">So I believe that until the Bianchi decision, which is only approximately three years ago, we cannot look at the practice that that was engaged in then as foreclosing any further examination of this subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.208" offset="2664155">We cannot in good conscience compel the parties to undertake the great expense involved in presenting this matter before us when it must be admitted, then our decision or findings of fact may be of no avail to either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.665" offset="2718072">I submit that the Board -- of Boards of Contract Appeals have sometimes declined to entertain what they recognized as a breach of contract claim because it would serve no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.799" offset="2766555">The Court of Claims would try it all over again, they wanted to comply with the decisions of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.359" offset="2788812">In many instances, they thought they were complying with this Court's decisions in the Rice case and the Crook case where this Court said that the delayed damages clause which appears as a standard clause in most contract did not authorize the Government, not the Board but even the courts to grant any damages for delay because that clause merely provided as an equitable adjustment and extension of time and a remission or non-imposition of the liquidated damages stipulated in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.661" offset="2910020">The Boards have frequently said, “You are asking for delay damages, and under the Rice doctrine or the Crook case, we can't give you any and nobody else can.So therefore, we won't hear it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="712.592" offset="2953697">So, I do not believe that there was any firmly established judicial or administrative course of conduct which would not allow this clause in the contract to be read now as the Government contends, it speaks plainly and as it should be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.342" offset="3012733">As a matter of fact, the words arising under is not peculiar or unique in this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.001" offset="3035408">The words arising under are used as a base for federal jurisdiction for example, District Court jurisdiction, when you talk about a case arising under a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.333" offset="3076681">Now that has been construed to be satisfied if rights or obligations are created or controlled by a federal law and then if one comes into court to either establish the -- those rights or to complain of a violation of those rights or obligations the federal court has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.197" offset="3148152">I see no reason why the clause in the disputes clause should be read any differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.321" offset="3168632">The contract governs the rights and the obligations of the parties and if there was a violation of those rights or if there was a need to enforce one of those rights, there is no warrant for saying that that is not a matter which arises under the contract in the same manner that any right or obligation arising under a federal law for jurisdictional purposes isn't equally affected.</text>

          <turn speaker="irving_jaffe" startTime="876.783" stopTime="1320.930">
            <label>Mr. Irving Jaffe</label>
            <text syncTime="876.783" offset="3610520">I should be speaking about disputes concerning questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.854" offset="3630791">The only reason that that now says disputes concerning questions of fact whereas sometimes the clause says disputes concerning questions and in former days they said before the Wunderlich Act, it's more frequently said all disputes concerning -- all disputes arising under this contract with the passage of the Wunderlich Act, the dropping of anything or the use of the word fact was merely intended to show that a decision on a question of law would not be final because this disputes clause is itself a finality clause as much as it is a jurisdictional clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.956" offset="3771225">So that when -- and the Court of Claims incidentally -- we're not at odds with the Court of Claims on the question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.607" offset="3797765">In Morrison-Knudsen, a case -- a decision which they handed down on exactly the same day they handed down the Grace case.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.245" offset="3824306">The Court of Claims there said that it would not determine whether or not to try cases de novo on the law of fact dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.120" offset="3851891">They recognized that if there was a clause, they still construed this arising under the same way, that if there was another clause of the contract which authorize the examination of facts and the determination of facts by the Board, then they would not grant the trial de novo and would accept those facts as found even though it underlay primarily a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.351" offset="3940812">So the Court of Claims itself does not make the law of fact dichotomy, a basis for determination of facts either by the Court or by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.196" offset="3980204">So we have -- we don't have that quarrel even with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.230" offset="3992325">I think it must readily be understood that no relief could be granted by anyone even under the changes article which no one disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.410" offset="4025031">Merely upon the finding of facts, the granting of relief, however elementary it may be, involves the application of some legal principle to those facts in order to say, "You are entitled to so many dollars."</text>
            <text syncTime="993.464" offset="4077275">So that they must -- everyone must who's granting relief, apply legal principles and determine them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.498" offset="4145403">Now, there is a second point involved in this case which is embodied in the dissenting opinion of Mr. -- of Judge Davis of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.446" offset="4193155">That point concerns the finding of facts properly found in the court -- under the Court of Claims interpretation of the arising under clause, in connection with relief which the Board might have -- might have granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.127" offset="4259924">The Court now says however that when those same facts have to do with their so-called breach of contract claim that it will determine those facts de novo and they will not be bound by the facts as found by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.810" offset="4322617">Judge Davis dissents on the ground that he feels that that -- the disputes clause, the Wunderlich Act and the decision of this Court will be argued, have already declared that any facts properly so found are binding for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.063" offset="4387610">That seems to me to be demonstrable very readily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.953" offset="4403179">In the disputes clause, it says -- and speaking of the finality aspect of the clause, it says, “Whose decision shall be final and conclusive upon the parties thereto.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.134" offset="4455946">In other words, the facts found by him which withstand the test of the Wunderlich Act and in the -- this case, they do withstand the test of the Wunderlich Act or at least they assume it for the purposes of their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.764" offset="4514461">If finding on the parties that at a certain fact that now exist, which the parties must accept, they cannot come in as they do in this case and say that the delays which the Government found for 60 days let us say, are no longer 60 days for any purpose but an extension of time and the fact that I can't be assessed for any liquidated damages for that 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.025" offset="4615502">We now come into the Court as the majority opinion illustrates and says, "We now claim that the delay was 120 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.747" offset="4650402">And of that a 120 days, we believe that a 105 were unreasonable delays caused by the Government and therefore, we want damages for that period of time."</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.322" offset="4696691">The dissenting opinion of Judge Davis said that the period of delays found by the Board were necessary for them in order to determine whether they give an extension of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.106" offset="4735770">And in considering those things, the delays damages article, Article 9 which appears in our brief on page 4, beginning on page 4, makes -- delegates the contracting officer the job of finding out the courses and the facts of delay and makes those final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.823" offset="4826676">Now are they final only for the period of time that the contract may be extended or to the period of time during which liquidated damages will not be assessed, or does it actually find that this is the period of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.393" offset="4872965">It includes delays caused by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.170" offset="4884041">May the Court now say, “Well, the contracting officer found that the Government only caused 60-days delay.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.250" offset="4904417">But now that he is suing for damages for that delay, we can find that it was a 120 days, and try all the facts all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.660" offset="4942033">Neither the contract nor the Wunderlich Act which doesn't speak about final or limited purposes, or final only for the purpose for which they acted, it is final and is final for all purposes, we think that is self-evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.242" offset="4996368">One other thing that I would like to emphasize is that this Court has ruled that this arrangement, this contract between the parties, that the fact finders, the triers of the fact shall be one party to the agreement is a valid, binding, and enforceable agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.759" offset="5074422">Now, we ask this Court to find and determine that the disputes clause here without restriction makes the agency, to trier of all questions, all disputed questions concerning a question of fact in the disputes clause which we urge stands on its own feet, not related to any other clause in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.159" offset="5163969">We say that that clause makes the Government agency the trier of all the facts that may arise concerning a question under this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.434" offset="5201063">And if the dispute is bottomed upon this contract, if they must plead this contract in order to be successful in the course of action, then it is a course of action or it is a claim or a dispute arising under the contract and any question concerning that dispute must be tried by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.116" offset="5271803">And, the only thing that would happen if the agency did not -- either because it was -- it mistakenly believed it had no jurisdiction, if as this Court said in Bianchi, if the record is insufficient, if it's defective, if more facts are needed, then the trier of the fact, the agency, tries them and it goes back either by suspension or remand, the semantics are unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.374" offset="5364903">I would like to reserve my remaining time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.582" offset="5377651">Thank you.</text>
