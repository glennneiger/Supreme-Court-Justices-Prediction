            <label>Mr. Richard A. Posner</label>
            <text syncTime="8.508" offset="137383">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.431" offset="153057">If the Court will bear with me briefly, I'll try to restate the government's position on the jurisdictional issue here in such a way as to answer some of the questions that members have put -- had yesterday and were left unresolved at the recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.095" offset="231737">We're trying to make sense here of a statutory pattern, a network of interrelated statutory provisions in the Shipping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.331" offset="272697">Now, putting aside for a moment the question of the bearing, if any of the Hobbs Act on this question, the pattern here is the same as under the Interstate Commerce Act, the issue discussed in the Atlantic case yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.180" offset="336123">Now review briefly, the salient features of this statutory pattern in the Shipping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.678" offset="366111">First, Section 22 provides that any person may file with the Commission a complaint against the carrier and if the carrier doesn't satisfy the complaint than after the usual administrative proceedings and hearing, the Commission can issue an order and it can issue orders of two types.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.205" offset="456182">On the one hand, it can make an order prospect of an effect, a prescriptive, or injunctive or declaratory order, regulating the carrier's practices for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.098" offset="511770">And on the other hand, it can issue a damages order that is a reparations order directing the carrier to pay, to make a money payment to the shipper to make him hold for the damages that he suffered as a result of an unlawful act by the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.439" offset="605080">The next section, I want to mention is Section 31 of the Act which provides that the venue and procedure and actions to enforce, set aside or suspend orders of the Maritime Commission shall be the same as in similar actions involving ICC orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.977" offset="683238">This Section incorporates by reference the Urgent Deficiencies Act which is now codified in Section 1336, the Judicial Code, which empowers the District Courts to set aside orders of the Maritime Commission at the behest of the carrier and these review proceedings are brought against the Commission of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.584" offset="793684">Now, on its face of Section 31 would seem to embrace and make reviewable in these actions against the Commission of the United States, both kinds of orders under Section 22, both the prescriptive, injunctive type orders and the reparations orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.540" offset="877484">We think that Section 31 should not be so construed, however, and we rely for this distinction in result on two further sections of the Shipping Act, Sections 29 and 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.438" offset="937148">And their interrelation is really the core of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.112" offset="959822">Under Section 29, the Commission and the Attorney General as well as the charging party is empowered to bring Federal District Court proceedings to enforce orders of the Maritime Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.796" offset="1022516">But not all orders, only those orders prescriptive or injunctive in effect, our orders for the payment of money that is reparations orders are expressly excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.103" offset="1075806">The procedure for enforcing reparations orders is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.377" offset="1092838">It is set forth in Section 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.662" offset="1114049">This enforcement action provided for by Section 30 is one brought by the shipper against the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.980" offset="1147277">The Maritime Commission or the Attorney General are not parties, have no power to enforce such orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.789" offset="1178520">Moreover, in the shipper's enforcement action, the shipper has been given distinct procedural advantages, a wide choice of form, freedom from costs and a reasonable attorney's fee if he prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.554" offset="1241631">There is no counter part in Section 29 relating to the enforcement of non-reparations order to these procedural advantages in Section 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.829" offset="1298683">Now why did Congress make a distinction in the enforcement mechanism for non-reparations and reparations orders?</text>
            <text syncTime="309.128" offset="1339852">Why the first enforceable by the -- by the government but not the second and why does the shipper enjoy special advantages in his enforcement suit of reparations orders?</text>
            <text syncTime="326.194" offset="1408188">The answer we think has to do with a limited public interest in a reparations proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.189" offset="1440162">If the Commission issues an order prescribing a rate, that's an order that governs the relationship between the carrier and the shippers -- and all shippers for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.148" offset="1495960">If on the other hand, it goes on to award the shipper damages for the past misconduct of the carrier for the unjust rate say that the carrier charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.617" offset="1545801">This is just an adjustment between shipper and carrier, an assessment of damages and the process of assessing damages is one traditionally left to private litigation and so here to a shipper's enforcement suit in which the government plays no role.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="381.474" stopTime="409.760">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="381.474" offset="1629288">Could I ask you a question of this point and it goes back to something that you said at the conclusion of the argument yesterday that interested me.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.096" offset="1667741">As a basis for making an award of damages, are there not usually questions involved that are of more than personal interest between the particular railroad or particular carrier and a particular shipper?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_a_posner" startTime="409.760" stopTime="469.623">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Posner</label>
            <text syncTime="409.760" offset="1742451">That depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.083" offset="1747675">Very often in reparations case, involving say an overcharge under a tariff, the tariff or the rate is no longer in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.847" offset="1786755">Now in other cases, the rate or tariff that's found unlawful is continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.620" offset="1817893">But in a case like that, the Maritime Commission or the Interstate Commerce Commission will issue two orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.767" offset="1842448">The one prescribing the just and reasonable rate which the carrier is required to charge the shipper and then going on from there and assessing damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.549" offset="1893543">Now, the first order is of public significance and is reviewable in this action brought by the carrier against the United States and the Commission to set aside the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.376" offset="1940877">But the damages phase of the proceeding in which there is a much less public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.867" offset="1966791">That's the subject of the shipper's enforcement action.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="469.623" stopTime="500.131">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="469.623" offset="1981837">Yes but when you get to a enforcement action, shipper's enforcement action going back to the Interstate Commerce numbers which I can remember easier and the other section numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.574" offset="2033664">Under 16 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, that basic order of the Commission that is a general public interest is drawn in question there too, isn't it in the shippers action?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_a_posner" startTime="500.131" stopTime="540.424">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Posner</label>
            <text syncTime="500.131" offset="2103881">No, as I understand the practice of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.442" offset="2117151">It issues two separate orders and only the reparations order is at issue in the shipper's enforcement act and it is true that the underlined violation of law which is at issue in the shipper's enforcement action may have continuing significance because it was a subject of an order prescribed in a new rate but that order will be reviewable in the ordinary mode where the Commission and the United States participate.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.424" offset="2265109">The only issue on a shipper's action would be the amount of damages do you think?</text>

            <text syncTime="545.599" offset="2285798">The -- the question on whether the carrier had violated the Act could also be an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.926" offset="2311084">However --</text>

            <text syncTime="554.273" offset="2320488">And what can the Commission's determination will be examined de novo and that -- in the shipper's action on that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_a_posner" startTime="560.267" stopTime="607.222">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Posner</label>
            <text syncTime="560.267" offset="2344417">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.534" offset="2345462">I think clearly not because the question on whether a carrier has violated the Shipping Act, the Interstate Commerce Act is the kind of question on which this Court has said that the basic determination is for the expert tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.174" offset="2424038">It must evaluate and appraise the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.068" offset="2443682">Therefore, it would not be opened to shipper or carrier in the enforcement action to introduce new evidence and ask the District Court to review a de novo, the question of a violation or it can ask the District Court to prescribe the just and reasonable rate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="607.222" stopTime="634.329">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="607.222" offset="2532289">So that in that aspect of the reparations action at least the prima facie -- only the prima facie -- the prima facie provisions of Section 16 give way to a substantial evidence test, I suppose, and the Commission's determination on that is not reviewable if there is substantial evidence to support it, is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="635.874" offset="2646915">You have to reach that through a primary jurisdiction doctrine and put that kind of a gloss on the face in Section 16.</text>

            <text syncTime="723.516" offset="2997478">You don't see any danger there being inconsistent decisions on Commission questions that are of general public interest when I could be an affirmative by having these multiple actions brought to different courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.210" offset="3060172">First, because the Commission's primary jurisdiction is in any event protected; and second, because insofar as a finding of violation has continuing significance, it's not just a dead practice but gives rise to a rate setting order or other order of prospective effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.241" offset="3160377">It will be the subject of review and actions in which the Commission and the government are a party and can protect their interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.978" offset="3287333">Let's assume which I guess is possible that you have a case involving only the issue of reparations and not the question of prescription or injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.345" offset="3344802">Now, as I understand your argument, despite the use of the words prima facie in Section 30, you're saying that the Commission's findings have to be accepted as inclusive if I understand what you're saying and where do you get an opportunity for a judicial review on the basis of your approach to this?</text>

            <text syncTime="847.257" offset="3492446">Our position is that -- where the shipper sues upon a reparations order, the District Court in which he sues and the Court of Appeals reviewing the District Court's decision has power to review the findings, all the findings, which underlie that order in the same manner as if the carrier were attacking it in a conventional appeal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.380" offset="3620864">Now, one of the basic findings in every reparations order would be that the carrier had violated the Shipping Act and this finding is subject to judicial review of the same scope and extent as in any action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.502" offset="6957432">On August 23, Consolo wrote a letter to Flota in which he for the first time requested that he'd be permitted to share space on Flota's vessels with other shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.455" offset="7033187">The letter was addressed to Flota in Bogota, Colombia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.778" offset="7054503">It referred to the recent decision of the Maritime Board in the Grace Line case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.908" offset="7074983">I may say that that decision which clearly contrary to existing practice up to that time, it was based upon a novel and untested theory of law which was in fact later rejected by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.938" offset="7143111">And the order itself was clearly an experiment by the Maritime Board with the regulation of the carriage of bananas, a specialty item in the commerce of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.887" offset="7206954">Judge Moore of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a still later case in which he dissented referred to the Maritime Board order of May 1957, the one that had been reversed as a guinea pig experiment on the shipping industry and an autocratic use of powers by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.426" offset="7293053">The August 23, 1957 letter from Consolo did not state when he wanted to ship bananas he did not state how much space he wanted, he did not offer to post the guarantees which the Board had already said, a carrier was entitle to before it was required to give space to a shipper, and it committed Consolo to nothing whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.779" offset="7394513">It cost him only cost of paper and postage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.163" offset="7412067">He threatened to sue Flota if we did not give him space.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.870" offset="7426800">Flota also received similar demands from other shippers and other shipper's lawyers, likewise, threatening to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.540" offset="7461491">At the same time, its existing contract shipper, Panama Ecuador said that if you do give space to anyone else, we'll sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.327" offset="7496704">Flota was faced with a lawsuit whichever way it turned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.703" offset="7514154">However, it had a clause in its contract with Panama Ecuador which said that if any portion of the contract were declared invalid or unenforceable, Flota might terminate it on seven or ten days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.032" offset="7575489">Flota's officials came from New York, his manager and director from Bogota and met with the staff of the Maritime Board on August -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.489" offset="7613315">On October 1st, 1957, presented the problem to the staff and said in effect, we will do whatever you tell us but just tell us what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.735" offset="7650304">The Board staff said that it was unable to advice Flota as to its proper course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.195" offset="7676113">Flota then filed a petition for declaratory order with the Maritime Board itself on October 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.360" offset="7700773">The Board sat on the order for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.330" offset="7712684">It did not assign a docket number to the petition, excuse me, until May 1, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.167" offset="7744031">When it did decide to entertain the petition, it consolidated it with complaints or reparations and against -- complaints against Flota's practice and for reparations filed by Consolo and also by another banana shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.941" offset="7807143">As a result of the initial six months delay and the consolidation with the reparations claim, the case did not go to hearing until November 1958, more than a year after the petition for declaratory order had been filed and no decision was rendered as to whether or not the contract was valid and should be canceled until early July 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.396" offset="7904946">All of these matters are fairly explored in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.335" offset="7928665">The Board directed Flota in July 1959 to cancel its existing contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.592" offset="7957713">As Flota had told the Board, it would do whatever it said. Flota in fact canceled its existing contract and it complied with the Board's order which was served in July 2, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.357" offset="8008808">The Board then held supplemental hearings on the issue of reparations and in 1961, directed Flota to pay $143,000 to Mr. Consolo's reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.129" offset="8067845">Both the shipper and the carrier then appealed to the Court of Appeals under the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.708" offset="8090206">The Court of Appeals found that the order directing Flota to open its space was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.861" offset="8130853">Flota had challenged the order only to the extent that it would serve as a basis -- might serve as a basis for reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.015" offset="8155408">It remanded the case to the Maritime Board having found -- the court having found that there was substantial evidence in support of Flota's contention that under all of the circumstances, it would be inequitable to award reparations to Consolo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.331" offset="8228655">The Court of Appeals said that the mere fact that there had been a finding in July 1959, directing Flota to open its space and finding that its contract was in violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.686" offset="8278079">It did not mean that the Board was not permitted to examine the circumstances of the violation in the context of Flota -- of Consolo's reparation claim in order to determine whether or not it would be fair to assess reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.414" offset="8333040">The central finding of the Commission on remand, the Commission having meanwhile succeeded to the Maritime Board was that Flota was not acting in good faith when it undertook the contract with Panama Ecuador in May 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.539" offset="8393540">The Government's brief to the Court of Appeals admitted that the Commission's award stood or fell on the good faith finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.338" offset="8424678">That finding, challenging Flota's good faith was the first such challenge in six years, six decisions and as many years of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.551" offset="8457592">There was not a suggestion of bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.838" offset="8466683">And any of the trial examiners, two decisions on the subject and any of the Maritime Board's two decisions on the subject or for that matter in any of the briefs of the public counsel who had participated in the first phase of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.987" offset="8519346">The procedure followed by the Commission on remand as we submit significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.507" offset="8541393">It did not refer the case to its hearing examiner although the same hearing examiner was then a member of the Commission staff and was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.389" offset="8580890">The Commission's minutes show that five days after argument to the Commission had called in its general counsel and submitted the case to him with the direction to prepare a proposed report and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.041" offset="8635538">The minutes state that the general counsel was given instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.407" offset="8652988">They do not state what instructions were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.708" offset="8666154">The Commission's next meeting on the subject was, 11 months later, when the general counsel submitted a proposed report and order and the Commission adopted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.818" offset="8702621">Perhaps, this practice is ordinarily unobjectable -- unobjectionable for a Commission and agency requires resort to legal counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.572" offset="8741700">But here, the general counsel and his deputy had participated before the Court of Appeals in the first proceeding as advocacy against Flota taking the position that Flota had violated the law and should be required to pay reparations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.975" offset="8799274">The same gentlemen then were given an opportunity to write the Commission's opinion on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.153" offset="8831979">And the Commission's opinion on remand was in many respects a restatement of arguments which the Commission's advocates had unsuccessfully made to the Court of Appeals for the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.084" offset="9047751">We were required to obtain an order from the Court of Appeals to make them a part of the record but over the agency's opposition, the Court issued the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.657" offset="9082023">The minutes show that the Commission requested the general counsel to prepare a proposed report and order in accordance with instructions given by the Commission that's the minute of September 1962, I believe -- early October ‘62.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.518" offset="9157465">A minute -- the next minute on the subject in September 1963 shows that the general counsel submitted a proposed report and order which had been prepared in accordance to the instructions given by the Commission and the Commission adopted the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.800" offset="9242624">It's perfectly obvious that the general counsel didn't take 11-months merely to mechanically transcribe detailed instructions which the Commission might have given him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.034" offset="9295496">The Commission admitted before the Court of Appeals that the general counsel had in fact participated in the Commission's decision making function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.490" offset="9329351">The Court of Appeals referred to the fact that the general counsel had formulated the Commission's opinion but it found that it was unnecessary for it to reach the legal issues which this fact raises because it said, the Commission's findings were in any event unsupported -- were contrary to the substantial weight of the evidence and that the Commission had abused its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.604" offset="9441782">We contended to the Court of Appeals that the procedure followed violated constitutional guarantees of fair hearing, the Administrative Procedure Act in the Commission's own rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.355" offset="9480756">Not only are the provisions or the requirements of law with respect to the separation of functions involved but also the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act with respect to the formulation of the proposed report an order by hearing examiners service to parties opportunity to make exceptions and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.768" offset="9578454">The petitioner contends that the court below did not hold that there was no substantial evidence to support the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.911" offset="9627042">This is at legal contention not dependent upon the particular facts of the controversy but a contention that the court below failed to apply the substantial evidence rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.264" offset="9676466">The Court's actual holding was that the Commission's determination and I quote omitting a few words that I don't think it's important, “ignored the substantial weight of the evidence before it”, and later in the Court's opinion that the Commission had abused its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.231" offset="9748250">In amplifying these findings, the lower court stated that there was strong evidence of Flota's good faith, that Flota's conduct was completely consistent with its assertive that they -- that the law was unsettled and Flota's legal obligation was not clear during the period in question that it was clear that Flota had acted on the basis of reasonable doubts with good grounds, with substantial justifications that Flota had sought and administrative determination of its duties as promptly as possible and then noted, in addition, that Consolo had suffered no out of pocket laws as a result of the exclusion space during -- exclusion of him from Flota's space during a reparations period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2473.652" offset="9997981">It's clear in context that the Court of Appeals was fully aware of the limitations of a reviewing court, that it was fully aware of this court's decision in the universal camera case which it cited of the limitations of review under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.754" offset="10066422">And in context, we submit it's clear that it did apply the substantial evidence rule and the Government's brief in this case admits that the lower court's judgment was a decision that the Commission's decision itself was not supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.349" offset="10136743">So to the extent that the petitioners here trying to create a legal issue, what he terms as a noble standard of review, it, I submit, is to make weight without merit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.323" offset="10196616">The Government says, not that the Court of Appeals fail to apply the substantial evidence rule but that it applied it, but applied it wrongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.639" offset="10229948">This requires a review of the evidence to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.372" offset="10252831">In fact, the issue as to the insubstantiality of the evidence was not raised in the petition for writ of certiorari but we do not believe this properly before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2567.401" offset="10372995">Here, the case was before the Court of Appeals twice, before the same panel of judges, each decision was unanimous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2602.672" offset="10514056">We believe that the Court, if it decides to review the substantiality of evidence will conclude -- must conclude that the Court of Appeals did make a fair assessment of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.037" offset="10559509">If it goes beyond that, beyond the fair assessment test, then I wish to point out just a couple of omissions in the Commission's decision, which I think really, completely indicts the integrity of the decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2640.610" offset="10665775">The Commission charged that in May 1957, Flota deliberately violated the law in the face of what it regarded as two authoritative Board announcements, the decisions in the Grace Line cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.607" offset="13653765">I would like, however, to answer Mr. Chief Justice Warren's question to Mr. McDonnell yesterday as to whether Senator Bacon was the Floor Manager of the Hepburn Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.210" offset="13736208">The answer is that he was not the Floor Manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.702" offset="13746134">However, he was a proponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.725" offset="13754284">There were a number of amendments under consideration at the time the statement Mr. McDonnell quoted was made and proponents and opponents and various mixtures in combinations involving several different amendments, all agreed with Senator Bacon's statement which he repeatedly said. He said, is there any word or combination of words in the English language which could possibly be broader than these, any order or requirement and in one instance, Senator -- on the other side of the question which he was debating would say, I understand or know and agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.979" offset="13935261">So, it's clear in the context of that particular section of the debates that everyone understood that this was the broadest possible language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.726" offset="13970265">The question was not, what orders would be reviewable but what the scope of review would be?</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.832" offset="13990745">This was 1906, the question that was really a primary jurisdiction kind of debate in the halls of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.677" offset="14034108">I should also like to make the position of parties before the Court of Appeals clear to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.211" offset="14068172">The -- the petitioner here, first, raised the jurisdictional question in the first proceeding before the Court of Appeals by a preliminary motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.772" offset="14098474">It was an alternative motion in which he said, either dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or require the carrier to post a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.518" offset="14125432">The Court held the motion in advance and decided that -- decided the issue at the time it rendered this decision of the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.808" offset="14154585">In his briefs on the merits after he -- the motion had been held in advance, Consolo argued unequivocally that because the case was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.881" offset="14190947">The Court should take in jurisdiction in dispose the entire controversy that was the first proceeding before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.860" offset="14218846">When the case returned to the Court of Appeals the second time neither Consolo or the Government nor anybody else said a word about the jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.984" offset="14251342">Everybody assumed jurisdiction, exercised it and only after Consolo and the Government had lost on the merits did they take the position in this case -- in this Court but the Court of Appeals do not have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.687" offset="14306095">And the Government says even now that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction on the narrow ancillary ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.636" offset="14357922">The Hobbs Act is a subject which has been referred to but not really discussed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.976" offset="14379238">The very purpose of Congress in passing the Hobbs Act in 1950 was to solve the kind of problems that we've all been wrestling here in the context of the Interstate Commerce Act situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.791" offset="14426572">A clear and overriding intention of the Congress was to provide what it considered to be an improved and uniform procedure for review of all orders of the Maritime Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.705" offset="14478190">The Bill as it originally was introduced extended both to the ICC and also to the Maritime Commission and it did not extend to all of the orders of either of these agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.888" offset="14530957">The ICC came in and said, our volume of litigation is just too great, we fear that if we are -- if jurisdiction to review all ICC orders is placed in the Court of Appeals, it will bog down the judiciary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.170" offset="14580067">So please exempt us from the Bill and that the Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.923" offset="14595114">The Maritime Commission representatives its Chairman and its then Solicitor came before the congressional committees and said, “We like this Bill except it isn't broad enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.064" offset="14631581">Please make it sufficiently broad to cover all reviewable orders of the Maritime Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.171" offset="14656031">And the Commission Solicitor specifically said, as you have written the bill now, it does not include orders under Section 22 under which we issue a great volume of orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.067" offset="14695633">Section 22 is the section under which reparation orders are issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.603" offset="14713814">And the Congress amended the bill in accordance with the request of the Maritime Commission to extend to all reviewable orders of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.699" offset="14754147">Now, no specific mention was made of reparation orders except as they fell within broad category of orders under Section 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.473" offset="14789256">But there was before the Congress a list of reviewable orders of the ICC at the time that the ICC was proposed to be subject to the Bill and one of these lists had been prepared by the administrative office of the United States courts and it's set forth in the Senate judiciary report which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.622" offset="14861876">And that list did specifically refer to reparation orders of the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.205" offset="14884237">The Congress was fully aware of the identity or the parallel situation between the Shipping Act and the Maritime Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.928" offset="14915062">In addition, this Court handed down its decision in United States versus ICC in mid-1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.267" offset="14944423">The Hobbs Act was passed in December of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.078" offset="14963649">The petitioner here argues to the court that the Congress intended to vest under the Hobbs Act jurisdiction to review only actions which had formally been the subject to three-judge court actions but that are not the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.345" offset="15016730">The Senate judiciary committee after United States versus ICC was handed down, said that the purpose of the bill is to provide a uniform procedure with respect to all reviewable orders and in discussing this, it said in many cases, not in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.220" offset="15092276">In many cases, these orders are three-judge court orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.865" offset="15110875">So from the standpoint of the overall objective of the Hobbs Act, from the standpoint of the language of the Hobbs Act, reparation orders should be in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.361" offset="15168867">The language of the Act is analyzed thoroughly in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.579" offset="15185690">We submit that even if reparation orders of the ICC are not reviewable at the instance of the carrier, I believe they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.686" offset="15238144">But even if they are not, they were made reviewable under the Hobbs Act and that any contrary decision would defeat it clear, overriding purpose of Congress in 1950 to provide modern system of review for reparation orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.213" offset="15312227">Thank you.</text>
