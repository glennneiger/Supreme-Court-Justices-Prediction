            <text syncTime="7.906" offset="134980">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.296" offset="152534">This is an appeal from a judgment of the New York Court of Appeals determined by a divided vote 4 to 3, judgments on the Appellate Division and of the special term holding -- upholding the constitutionality of certain provisions of Section 7 and upholding the constitutionality of the entirety of Section 9 of the Chapter 431 of the laws of New York of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.030" offset="299447">My remarks here are going to be directed entirely to the question of the constitutionality of Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.166" offset="328077">I'll leave the question of the constitutionality of Section 7, because of the limitations of time, to my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.081" offset="363708">The parties involved here, the appellants are in three categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.082" offset="387741">The first are the most of the distillers who sell liquor throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.138" offset="419924">They will be referred to here either as distillers, manufacturers, or the owners of the brand name.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.877" offset="458898">Also, appellants here are importers of liquor from other countries who sell here.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.053" offset="495574">They will be referred to either as the brand owners or as importers.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.657" offset="518040">Also as appellants, are wholesalers who sell the liquor of the various whole -- importers and distillers exclusively in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.347" offset="572792">Mr. Jack Goodman, who is associated with me in this case, will at the conclusion of my remarks have some remarks to make concerning the New York wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.857" offset="622843">Now, before I get into a discussion of Section 9 and what it entails and why we think it is unconstitutional, I would like to review briefly the alcoholic beverage control law of New York State because I think with an understanding of what has gone before, it will be more readily apparent why we believe and urge that Section 9 is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.923" offset="739035">New York, like most of the other states, after repeal in 1933 for the purpose of promoting temperance and at least to limit the social evils that flow from unrestricted consumption of alcohol past an Alcoholic Beverage Control Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.366" offset="828792">That law still continues in effect with various amendments which I am going to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.114" offset="855855">Sometime in the late 1940s, the legislature apparently felt that the distillers and some of the wholesalers were taking advantage of the law and were giving discounts and other things that weren't helpful to restricting the evils which the legislation and the Act tried to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.165" offset="964002">So, at that time, the Act was amended to provide that each distiller and each wholesaler must file each month a schedule of the prices at which they were to sell their liquor, that is, the wholesaler would have to file the price or the distiller or brand owner would have to file a schedule, they are called postings, and they were publicly displayed which would show the price that his commodity was being sold throughout the state to wholesalers and it had to be sold to every wholesaler at that price, less certain discounts which were provided for in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.115" offset="1139858">Likewise, the wholesaler had to file each month a schedule which would show the prices at which he would sell to retailers anywhere in the state, and they had to abide by those prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.270" offset="1196492">In other words, there couldn't be competition between wholesalers, there could be competition between wholesalers but there couldn't be competition between one wholesaler and various retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.678" offset="1246124">Wholesalers, after they had posted their prices, however, within 10 days after the original posting, if they saw that another wholesaler was selling the same brands for less, could then reduce his price to the price of the other wholesaler so there was competition as between wholesalers but no competition as between wholesalers and retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.368" offset="1336822">Now, that law went on until the early 1950s or the late 1940s and then --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="318.318" offset="1376632">There was no control of the consumer price?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_f_daly" startTime="322.318" stopTime="326.378">
            <label>Mr. Thomas F. Daly</label>
            <text syncTime="322.318" offset="1392619">Only the contractual fair trade pricing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="326.378" stopTime="326.696">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="326.378" offset="1408920">So --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_f_daly" startTime="326.696" stopTime="822.480">
            <label>Mr. Thomas F. Daly</label>
            <text syncTime="326.696" offset="1410173">I'm going to come to that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.134" offset="1415920">During all this period, they could fair trade by contractual arrangements, but that was the only control on consumer prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.071" offset="1463672">Now, in the late 40s, it was discovered that there was a price war going on that in spite of price control, the contractual price control, a price war is going on and retailers and other people were selling liquor in a way that the legislature felt again, was not carrying out the objects of temperance and controlling the evils that are thought to flow from the unrestricted sale and consumption of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.837" offset="1594702">So at that time, the legislature passed an Act which became law, which made price control mandatory, and they did that for the expressed purpose and I quote -- I don't quote this, I read this, as a result and for the purpose of eliminating price wars “which unduly stimulate the sale of liquor and wine, mandatory price control will be adopted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="403.833" offset="1718732">Now, what mandatory price control was, the state said, the alcohol -- we, the distiller, the wholesaler -- the price set by the distiller for the sale and retail of the brand named product will be enforced by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.746" offset="1806399">In other words, the Alcoholic Control Board would enforce that and for instance, if a retailer sold at a price that was fixed, a price below what it was fixed by the manufacturer, his license could be taken away or it could be otherwise disciplined by the Alcoholic Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.711" offset="1898245">It wasn't left to private enforcement and that was to a logic stand, very effective in keeping prices pegged by the distiller and there was no selling below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.638" offset="1965955">Now, we get down to 1960 and for various reasons unconnected with what I'm discussing now, a scandal broke out in the liquor authority in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.762" offset="2006392">It reached such proportions that Governor Rockefeller felt that it should be investigated and he appointed under an Act known as the Moreland Act, he appointed commissioners to make a study of the Alcoholic Control Board laws and what could be done to eliminate large fields of discretion which apparently brought about this corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.506" offset="2109419">He is the Governor, appointed three distinguished citizens of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.889" offset="2130944">The Chairman was former Judge Walsh, who was also an Assistant Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.100" offset="2167724">They conducted long hearings and investigated the whole ABC law and came up with a number of conclusions, most of which have no bearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.265" offset="2216417">But among the conclusions they came up with was that New York State or the citizens of New York State were paying about a dollar a quart or a dollar a fifth more for liquor throughout the -- in the state and than was being charged to citizens of the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.921" offset="2299068">Now and they've -- they said that the reason, and this is awfully important (Inaudible) -- I want to impress it on the Court, the reason that New York citizens were being charged more than citizens of other state was because of the mandatory price control provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.357" offset="2388825">And I would like to point to the findings of the Commission as they appear in the record or the recommendations of the committee, and I refer to page 157 of the record, and here's their conclusion, “For all of the foregoing reasons, we have concluded that Section 101 (c),” and Section 101 (c) was the mandatory price control provisions of the law, “injures the New York consumer in at least three important ways,” and then it goes on to talk about the price to the consumer in New York being higher and the elimination of free competition and having a competitive market in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.522" offset="2589445">They recommended to the Governor and to the legislature that this mandatory price provision be eliminated from the law, and they said, and it was their conclusion, that if this was done in spite of the fact that they intended to allow contractual fair trading to continue, it was their finding that with the elimination of mandatory price control, prices in New York would seek their natural level and the discrimination which they found against New York citizens would be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.066" offset="2739597">The Governor went along with that and a bill was introduced to provide for the elimination of mandatory price control, as well as the elimination of other practices which they had found to be bad and which do not concern us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.134" offset="2803858">And the Governor in his message to the legislature, and that appears on page 188 of the record and I'm now reading from the first -- second full paragraph, such a compulsory resale price maintenance is at war with the American system of free competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.772" offset="2890480">And then he goes on to say the result, and this is the result of mandatory price control, is that New York consumers have been compelled to pay on the average, $1 more per fifth of liquor than they would have to pay if they were a free market.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.325" offset="2960697">And then goes on to say that this runs about 150 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.983" offset="2983267">Again, I emphasize that what was causing this difference in price was mandatory price control.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.979" offset="3007300">A bill was submitted to the legislature which contained the provision eliminating mandatory price control, and I may say parenthetically that the elimination of this mandatory price control does not apply to wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.223" offset="3080234">New York State is a great grower of wine grapes and a great distiller, a manufacturer of wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.668" offset="3106043">So apparently, the legislature was making a distinction there between wine and other alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.135" offset="3147943">The legislature however, rejected the bill that had been introduced by the Governor, and a new bill was introduced which was in all respects, about the same except for the addition of Section 7, which I have referred to, and Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.888" offset="3246895">Now, those were incorporated in the new bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.180" offset="3288064">The Act, which became law and which we're attacking now appears in the appendix commencing at A5 but if Your Honors would turn to page A16, this is where we really get into the part that we're attacking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.530" offset="5537520">The legislature and the Moreland Act Commission believed that the elimination of mandatory price control would do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.210" offset="5580257">As I said, Section 9 which we're complaining about here was passed in order to forestall possible monopolistic practices designed to frustrate the elimination of such discrimination and disadvantages that Section 9 -- that was the reason for the enaction -- adoption of Section 9.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.188" offset="5720168">A related person shall mean (1), and I'm reading from page A17 of the appendix to our brief under (d) there, down towards the bottom of that paragraph, shall mean (1) -- shall mean any person, (1) in the business of which such brand owner or wholesaler designated as agent has an interest direct or indirect by stock or other security ownership as lender or lienor, or by interlocking directors or officers, or (2) the -- and this is the really important phrase, the exclusive principle or “substantial business of which is a sale of a brand or brands of liquor purchased from such brand owner or wholesaler designated as agent, and the same definition applies to sales from wholesalers to retailers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.424" offset="5953076">So, in other words, you can have throughout the United States not the distiller fixing this price, not the wholesaler fixing this price but some so-called related person who is some independent person who does a substantial amount of business in a particular brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.899" offset="6026951">There's no definition about a substantial amount is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.381" offset="6044923">The amounts of brands may run -- a particular distiller which a particular wholesaler sells may run anywhere from 75% down to 1% and we don't know what that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.235" offset="6096332">Now, let me also show the definition of price and I again, I move over to A19 (i).</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.731" offset="6150248">In determining the lowest price for which any item of liquor was sold in any other state or the District of Columbia, appropriate reductions shall be made to reflect all discounts in excess of those to be in effect under such schedule and all rebates, free goods, allowance, and inducements of any kind whatsoever offered, note that offered, or given to any such wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.689" offset="6290160">Now, it's not only the price at which some related person might sell, but the price at which he might have offered, although sale had not been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.098" offset="6331747">And these independent wholesalers are completely independent of the distillers so that some wholesaler out in some state in the Middle West or anywhere else, if he offers a brand of liquor, even if he sells below cost if he offers that brand in that particular month, that is the price, at a price that's even below cost, that is the price at which that brand of liquor must be sold in New York two months later because you have to first file your schedule and the affirmation for the price of the previous month at which you're going to sell in the succeeding month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.345" offset="6496737">So, two months later, New York must sell that brand of liquor at the price that this related person wholesaler sold somewhere in the United States and that includes all rebates which a state might -- some other state might allow and which New York doesn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="4159.703" offset="16742170">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.228" offset="16756276">Our position is that this law is an enactment within the authority of the State of New York under the Twenty-first Amendment bolstered by the police power as applied in a developing concept of the Government's concern for and responsibility and duty to the people and their well-being including economic well-being.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.906" offset="16895039">I submit that there is nothing in any decision of this Court under the Twenty-first Amendment including the Idlewild decision and the Bean decision then does -- that does other than support the validity of Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.285" offset="17004544">I think, perhaps when -- I might do now is clarify some of the things that have been said about this law and its purpose and its history and the New York wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.416" offset="17077060">The Moreland Commission decided and there are reports and, if it please the Court, I can send -- get together one set and send them down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.216" offset="17128260">I have quoted from them in the brief, have charts in the brief that show that the prices in New York State were higher to the consumer by about -- up to a dollar down half a fifth than they were elsewhere in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.803" offset="17206627">And these were brand prices, the prices largely of the -- what is known as the big-four distillers who are among the 62 plaintiffs and appellants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.166" offset="17284054">The Moreland Commission concluded that the prices were high to the consumer and their suggested remedy was to eliminate the consumer resale prices enforced by the State Liquor Authority and all this went up to the legislature in January 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.071" offset="17395649">Now, every -- in other words, the problem was in the consumer -- in the Moreland Commission report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.546" offset="17429608">It was found in the Moreland Commission report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.996" offset="17439326">They had the recommendation for solving this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.963" offset="17459179">Then, the legislature went to work on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.617" offset="17477883">There was a joint legislative committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.318" offset="17500662">Indeed, the same committee is holding hearings right now to find out why the prices haven't gone down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.210" offset="17524172">But, there was this joint legislative committee back here and they had hearings and the retailers, I take it, got busy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.261" offset="17564400">Everything that allege -- that leads the legislature to -- and the Congress, indeed, to adopt the law is not necessarily documented or recorded but they found out and people are telling them, and they are educated I take it if they didn't know before it about how the industry operates and the retailers testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.730" offset="17658337">You're going to remove these prices, consumer resale prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.131" offset="17679862">You better get at, and I quote, “the big fellows” because our prices obviously are necessarily influenced by the prices that we have to pay, the wholesaler has to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.655" offset="17749974">And so, the legislature, during the regular session, did nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.644" offset="17769932">And the Governor called a special session and by this time, as I say, they had learned and so they recommended that the way to solve the problem of consumer prices was not only by the elimination of the price fixing agreement -- sorry, the price fixing statute, but also by the elimination -- by requiring the whole -- distiller and wholesale prices to be lower in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="5287.810" offset="21254562">How come that in one-third of the states of these United States, they are required to warrant that their price is no lower than in other state?</text>

            <text syncTime="5316.681" offset="21370128">And, New York has never said that, although you can have a distiller fix consumer price that has to be high, but it's been high and there are in -- there have been, for example, letters put into records that indicate that when the con -- the wholesaler sells to the consumer or to the -- sorry, the distiller sells to the wholesaler, he says, “We charge you this and so, thou shall charge this and so to the wholesaler, wholesaler to the retailer, and then the consumer fixed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.108" offset="21535848">So, there is this influence and it is only those wholesalers who are controlled because the (Inaudible) -- the people who drew the law had learned that if they just said to the distillers, “you charge this,” the wholesaler wasn't going to do a particle of good because these -- the distillers -- the wholesalers who are the arm of the distillers would be keeping the price up, and this is why they did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.148" offset="21659982">And the fact that the distillers would be innocent of who is substantial and so on, there are affidavits in the record put in by the plaintiffs as to the number of wholesalers they have.</text>

            <text syncTime="7345.300" offset="29484596">I was trying to answer a question and that is why I said that, but I have insisted all along that this doesn't compel them to do anything -- any conspiring to fix prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="7358.599" offset="29537782">What Section 8 and this is -- they kept calling it an antitrust and an anti (Inaudible) -- no, competitive and still unlocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="7370.191" offset="29584175">What the legislature had in mind in writing that was, as I say, they had become educated and it didn't take clairvoyance for them to see that there would be a tacit maintaining of distiller and wholesale prices in order that the removal of Section 101 (c) was not going to mean the consumer resale price of their brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="7405.053" offset="29723564">And each one has his priced brand that they certainly don't want to come down to low prices, and this was the reason for this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7421.070" offset="29787617">And when they say in their brief, “Well, if we're doing this, you can get us under this statute or that statute or the other statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7428.908" offset="29818964">Well, it's up to the legislature to say whether we think this statute is good enough and the Court well knows there are any number of statutes that affect the individuals and industries conduct the same conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="7447.510" offset="29893360">I submit that this statute is entirely constitutional under the Twenty-first Amendment and even if we search for reasonableness under the police power that it certainly does not compel the violation of any provision of the Constitution or any statute and so there's no federal statute, there is no issue of supremacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="7474.394" offset="30000985">If the Court please, on the question of prematurity I think that -- well, when this action was brought, the state was just implying -- making us file the affirmations and everybody who filed an affirmation took the risk that if the affirmation were false they might end up imprisoned for six months with a $10,000 fine and all the other consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="7507.817" offset="30134627">They also took the risk, as we've pointed out in our brief, of perhaps violating the Sherman Act, of being accused of violating the Sherman Act and the Robinson-Patman Act and other provisions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7521.331" offset="30188648">So that -- and I think under the authorities under those circumstances, an action for declaratory judgment as our action was, is entirely proper that we don't have to wait until we've been convicted of a crime before we take an appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="7566.981" offset="30371297">That's it's perfectly reasonable to assume the consequences that are going to flow from this Act, and I think that we point them out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7575.947" offset="30407137">I don't have time to go into them now, but I don't think that they're assumptions without a sound basis and I don't think that the people in this industry should be subjected to the penalties that will accrue if they do violate the Act and that we should have to go to the (Inaudible) root cause of a first standing, that conviction before it's brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="7602.743" offset="30514343">Now, in answer to Your Honor's question about whether there was any finding that New Yorkers were discriminated against by the distillers, there's absolutely no finding of that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="7616.704" offset="30570141">In fact, the finding that the -- of the Commission which investigated this was that the prices in New York were due solely to Section -- the mandatory price resale and they said they didn't know where the excess price that they said was charged New Yorkers because of mandatory price sale -- retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="7636.863" offset="30650807">They didn't know where the difference went.</text>
            <text syncTime="7639.483" offset="30661256">They said that they assumed that some of it went to the retailers, some of it went to the wholesalers, and some of it may have gone to the distillers, but they really didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="7648.948" offset="30699186">There's no question, and they -- and it's supported in the record that the price of doing business in New York is considerably higher than it is in most of the other states, and that the profits to retailers I think the record shows in this state is 0.66 per dollar of sales whereas the average pri -- profit to retailer is I think it's in the record but my recollection is, is 1.26.</text>
            <text syncTime="7677.789" offset="30814542">So that, the retail profit because of the cost of doing business is considerably less in the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="7757.623" offset="31133863">And in fact, this legislation that we're complaining about was not passed in the legislative declaration as here, was not passed because distillers were charging more in New York or because distillers were controlling the wholesale price in New York or that the distillers had control of the wholesalers.</text>
