            <text syncTime="248.720" offset="1098271">Johnson was charged, was violating an 1867 conspiracy statute, making it an offense to conspire, to defraud the United States in any matter that was Section 371.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.075" offset="1179669">So, the initial inquiry here is whether Congress in adopting that conspiracy statute intended that it should cover a conspiracy with respect to a speech in the House of Representative; preparation, source material, motivation, its causation and its publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.738" offset="1318327">Now, this conspiracy statute was invalid in a tax bill in 1867 is considerable evidence that it was designed to meet much publicized tax fraud which preceded the introduction of this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.383" offset="1420936">But by reason of its general language, the judiciary quite properly held that it should apply to all frauds against the coin of contracts of the property of the United States because it said, conspiring to the fraud the United States in any manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.628" offset="1533889">And that valid interpretation is reasonable and logical and it's been a great utility to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.172" offset="1564087">Then in 1910, in the Harris case, this court said, well, it meant more than that, it manifest conspiracy to defraud the United States by obstructing the efficiency of government operations and then in 1923, in the opinion by Chief Justice Taft he said, conspiracy to defraud the United States means primarily cheating the government out of its property or money but secondarily, as obstructing lawful, governmental functions deceit, dishonest means or overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.596" offset="1777768">That stretched the statute for our behalf beyond anything known in the world of fraud extract it into the area of ethics, into the area of conflicts of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.246" offset="1844328">Because now the -– that was an unparalleled expansion of a penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.519" offset="1873481">The obstruction of lawful, governmental functions of course has no real meaning; no meaning at all is a conspiracy to obstruct governmental functions by spending on the sidewalk in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.484" offset="1937324">Is it conspiracy to obstruct governmental functions to agree with others to follow the war in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.163" offset="1988002">This thing uses the word dishonest means an overreaching.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.780" offset="2426441">So, to sustain count one, the initial issue is, did Congress in enacting that conspiracy statute intended, it should apply to a conspiracy with respect to speech?</text>

            <text syncTime="4074.296" offset="16400593">I am rather surprised to find that the Professor is making a distinction between speech and vote for the purposes of the Speech and Debate Clause because the case of Coffin against Coffin which this Court decided in (Inaudible) as the authoritative decision on the Speech and Debate Clause makes it very clear in this Court's decision in the Kilbourn against Thompson, decision in (Inaudible) made clear that the State's Speech and Debate Clause covers all official action taken in the capacity as represented to speech, vote, committee report, anything of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.282" offset="16608528">Now, to the English history, what's Strode's was a case of someone who in colonies introduced the bill regulating tanneries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.127" offset="16655862">I think it turns now that one of the books that he was a tenant but nothing has ever turned on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.307" offset="16676551">What happened is that when he got back to his local district, where the act that he was in favor of would have affected the local industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.337" offset="16720750">The local Government, which was called the (Inaudible) tried to prosecute him for introducing these bills in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.274" offset="16760456">And the problem, I'm sorry -- and at that point, Parliament passed this resolution saying that no -- for what he did in Parliament, he could not be prosecuted, in this case by a local, equivalent to our county Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.551" offset="16837569">Now, that became -- Strode case did become a kind of slogan case thereafter in the long fight between parliament and the crown, which I wouldn't have to -- have time to go and to now, but I've point out two things about the English history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.238" offset="16920325">One is that the Speech and Debate, the right of Parliament to talk about anything -- which was divided during Elizabeth's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.268" offset="16952404">They question whether the Parliament could talk about the succession for the religious questions which are coming up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.141" offset="16983960">That question was settled by 1689 in the English Bill of Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.122" offset="17007888">The period of the 18th century in England was a period when Parliament was trying to get for itself, not simply the right to talk about anything, but the right completely to regulate its own members and anybody that dealt with its own members.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.094" offset="17071731">And that period was a period, as a matter of fact, when the crown was trying to bribe Congressmen so they are not English prosecutions for bribery, but that alleged Parliament, the right of Parliament to govern itself and even govern people that dealt with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.334" offset="17144665">Exclusively, this Court has held was not taken over into American law and if it's --as the Court pointed it out in the Watkins case, they founders of our Constitution were very worried about legislative excess.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.919" offset="17219062">They were -- that was one of the things they tried to guard against and so, the Lex Parliamentary has never been part of the American law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.026" offset="17255528">The absence of English cases therefore is not controlling, but it is interesting that the only time the questions of bribery statutes have come up for decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.521" offset="17301504">There have been state bribery prosecutions but nobody raised any problems in the Speech and Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.560" offset="17325641">The only time that the question of the Speech and Debate Clause in relation to prosecutions for bribery of Congressman has been brought up are in three Colonial cases which are on page 34 of our main brief and in those, there was only one dissenting vote and the dissent was on the ground of Lex Parliamentaria.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.355" offset="17420831">The other three cases all have that -- it was possible -- they -- some of them said that it was a crime at Common Law to take a bribe and all of them incidentally, in the English has been showing its relations to the Lex Parliamentary considered that if you couldn't prosecute a Congressman for taking a bribe, you couldn't prosecute the person that gave him the bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.979" offset="17535248">That is their version, in other words, they approached the question pretty much.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.190" offset="17556146">Did come within the Lex Parliamentary or it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.177" offset="17572028">And, as I say, this Court has made it clear from the time of the Anderson against Dunn, to the time of Watkins that Lex Parliamentaria is not a part of American law, which we took over from Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.538" offset="17629497">So that from the purposes of the Speech and Debate Clause, I do not see that there is any possibility of drawing a distinction between the speech and above.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.581" offset="17677667">And, as far as the actual coverage of 0205 is concerned, in 1862, when it was passed on the floor of the House, the expressions were said that it was comprehensive as man could make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.679" offset="17750079">As for the argument that has been made here that -- well, it wouldn't have come within 1205 because at that moment, there was no legislation pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.518" offset="17793442">That old Massachusetts Coffin case that the -- even though it was physically said in the floor of the House, if it wasn't in relation to legislative matters, it wasn't with the speech within the Speech and Debate Clause, we have never contended that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.973" offset="17851225">We admit that this is when the -- that is the speech itself is within the Speech and Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.469" offset="17873272">It is our position that when you have a prosecution for taking money to give a speech, the act which is being questioned is the taking of the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.832" offset="17938683">Now, in that kind of a prosecution, we admit it will -- it was brought out here and it was shown that the speech was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.911" offset="17979016">This was also alleged in the indictment but the prosecution rested on the proof that the speech was prepared with a purpose in line, that it was used for that purpose, that money did go to the Congressman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.868" offset="18066892">And, let me say one thing about that, the theory -- the reason this prosecution was brought under 371 and not to violate specific statute, was that it was the theory and we think it's established by the evidence that this Congressman was, -- I just want to say, put on pay roll to do the thing that were to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.089" offset="18171695">The speech was part of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.785" offset="18178487">It was not all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.101" offset="18183816">The rest of it and the most important part goes up later with the representations for the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.129" offset="18223940">But, this does not mean that the Government takes the position that $500.00 was all that was given for the speech.</text>
