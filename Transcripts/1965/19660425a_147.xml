            <label>Mr. George K. McPherson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="51.860" offset="310836">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.333" offset="320658">The facts in this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.615" offset="333824">On August the 2nd, 1963, a grand jury of Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta, Georgia indicted the defendant, Thomas Rachel and 19 other defendants in separate indictments for a violation of the Georgia law making it a misdemeanor to fail and refuse to leave the premises of another after having been requested to leave by the person in charge of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.265" offset="432462">The incident for which the defendants were indicted occurred on the 17th of June 1963 when the defendant attempting to be seated and served in Leb's Restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia, failed and refused to leave the restaurant after having been asked to do so by the manager of the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.161" offset="511979">The indictment against the other 19 defendants contained identical allegations to the Rachel indictment with the exception that in some instances, the misdemeanor was alleged to have been committed on another date and at a different restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.712" offset="574255">On February the 17th, 1964, the defendant Rachel and the other 19 defendants filed a petition for removal in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the authority of Sections 1443 (1) and (2) and 1446, Title 28 U.S.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.041" offset="663489">The petition alleged that Georgia was by a statute perpetuating customs and serving members of the Negro race in places of public accommodation on a racially discriminatory basis and on terms and conditions not imposed on white race.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.668" offset="730049">Also, they were being prosecuted for acts done under color of authority derived from the Constitution and laws of the United States and for refusing to do an act inconsistent therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.970" offset="779264">On February the 18th, 1964, United States District Court Judge Boyd Sloan, remanded the cases to Fulton County Superior Court stating that the petition for removal failed to allege sufficient facts for removal of the case to the federal court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.697" offset="862124">On March 5th, 1964, the defendants filed a notice of appeal from the remand order to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.060" offset="895561">And on the 12th of March, the State of Georgia filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.450" offset="921161">And the defendants filed a motion to stay the remand order pending the appeal before the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.040" offset="951568">On that day, a hearing was held before a three-judge panel and a stay was granted by a two to one division of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.564" offset="981661">On the 5th of March 1965, after hearing oral argument, the Court of Appeals by a divided three-judge panel reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to hold a hearing and to dismiss the prosecution if it established that the removal of the defendants from the various places of public accommodation was done for racially discriminatory reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.964" offset="1099212">A timely petition was filed by the State of Georgia for rehearing en banc and this was denied on April 19th, 1965 and this Court granted certiorari on October the 11th, 1965 on three grounds with which we are concerned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.845" offset="1166712">First, the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to consider the appeal because the notice of appeal of the remand order was filed six days beyond the 10-day time limit required by Rule 37 (a) (2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.480" offset="1233272">Secondly, that the petition for removal failed to allege sufficient facts or valid ground for removing state prosecutions to the Federal Court, and third, the Court of Appeals aired in directing the District Court to look for only one criteria on the hearing and to dismiss the state court prosecution if that single element was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.988" offset="1323342">That element of course is that the arrest and removal of the defendants from the various restaurants in Atlanta, Georgia was done because of race discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.215" offset="1364198">If it pleases the Court, I would like to limit myself only to the first consideration that being the Rule of Criminal Procedure 37 (a) (2) and leave the latter two questions to Mr. Sparks my co-counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.146" offset="1419995">It is our contention that Rule 37 (a) (2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure apply to this case and apply to all appeals from criminal prosecution either before verdict or after verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.985" offset="1495333">By Act of February 24th, 1933, as amended, this Court was given the authority to prescribe rules of practice and procedure after verdict finding of guilty by the court if the jury was waived or pleas of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.039" offset="1555519">On May 7th, 1934 pursuant to the above Act, this Court promulgated 13 rules which they entitle “Rules of Practice and Proceedings” after plea of guilty, verdict of guilty, or finding of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.695" offset="1614137">Rule 3 of this Rules which is the predecessor to Rule 37 (a) (2) stated that an appeal must be taken five days after entry of judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.208" offset="1660217">Now, I call to the Court's attention the language entry of judgment of conviction because I believe that by the use of this language and by the title of the 13 rules, it is clear that these 13 rules apply only to after verdict appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.422" offset="1733047">By Act of June 29th, 1940, Congress gave the court authority to prescribe rules of practice in the criminal cases prior to and including verdict, finding of guilty or not guilty by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.027" offset="1795532">This Act required that these rules should be reported to Congress before they became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.438" offset="1817161">And pursuant to this Act, this Court have promulgated Rules 1-31 and 40-60 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by order dated December 26, 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.619" offset="1869824">These rules were submitted to Congress and became effective on March 21st, 1946 as provided by Rule 59.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.179" offset="1908067">By an order dated February the 8th, 1946, the court prescribed Rules 32-39 pursuant to the 1933 Enabling Act, allowing the court to promulgate rules after verdict and pleas of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.044" offset="1959581">The court made these rules effective on the same date that they made Rules 1-31 and 40-60 effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.172" offset="2012035">Also, by this order, the court instructed that these rules be titled the “Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure” and that all 60 rules should be consecutively numbered.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.783" offset="2062503">I think that it is clear from this February 8, 1946 order that the Supreme Court intended that Rules 1-60 should serve as a complete set of criminal rules of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.172" offset="2120077">This is manifested by all the rules becoming effective on the same day by the title of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and also by the fact that the court had them numbered consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.246" offset="2172322">Also, Rule 1 of the Federal Rule state the scope of these rules and that is that they are to govern the procedures in courts of the United States in all criminal procedures except as listed in Rule 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.780" offset="2238464">It should also be noted that Rule 54 specifically applies the rules of criminal procedure to remove proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.087" offset="2283708">Also, Rule 57 further outlines the purpose of the court and that it states that these rules shall govern all criminal proceedings thereafter commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.876" offset="2330833">Now, I believe that if the court had intended to separate Rules 32-39, and 1-31, and 40-60 into two separate categories, it would not have gone to the trouble of numbering the rules consecutively, entitled -- titling them as they did, and making them effective on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.089" offset="2423724">Also, it seems to me that these rules were prepared by an advisotory committee appointed by the Supreme Court, and so, we cannot say that this is a case where the left hand did not know what the right hand was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.230" offset="2488299">The court would have been explicit in separating the two rules if they were to retain the before verdict and after verdict limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.893" offset="2534902">Now, I submit if the distinction ever existed as to the applications of Rules 32-39 to limit that only to after verdict appeals, that this has been rectified by the enactment of Title 18 of United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.331" offset="2612746">This Act was entitled “An Act to Revise and Codify and Enacted into Positive Law Title 18 of the United States Code”.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.168" offset="2644093">All sixty rules of criminal procedure are embodied within this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.773" offset="2666454">Rule 37 (a) (2) specifically incorporated by reference in Section 37 and 32 of that Title.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.898" offset="2706996">And I think it's clear, as I've said before, by the title of the rules, by them being numbered consecutively, and by them being enacted to take effect on the same day that the court intended that these rules would cover all criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.479" offset="2781288">And I think that the purpose of Title 18, which states that Title 18 was the culmination of several years work and that every provision has been brought down to date, and the laws have been rearranged and the language modernized and simplified, and that many provisions were combined and overlapping eliminated, I think it is clear that the revisers undoubtedly realize what the purpose of the Supreme Court and the intention of the Supreme Court was in promulgating Rules 1-60.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.547" offset="2929560">And I think that the enactment of Title 18, which incorporates the entire set of sixty rules of Federal Criminal Procedure, is an acceptance by Congress of that court's intentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.353" offset="2984835">Furthermore, I suggest to the Court that Rule 3 of the old rules which limits appeal to five days after entry of judgment of conviction and comparing it with Rule 37 (a) (2) which allows 10 days for appeal after entry of judgment or order appealed from, further manifest the intention of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.539" offset="3089533">Entry of judgment of conviction clearly purports that these rules were to apply to after verdict appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.517" offset="3117432">However, by changing the language into leading judgment of conviction to judgment or ordered appealed from, they have removed the language of limitation and I believe have opened the rules to a wider scope than what they had under old Rule 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.624" offset="3213876">Furthermore, 37 (a) (2) provides that the United States has a right to appeal as authorized by statute and that that appeal must be taken within 30 days after the entry of order or judgment appealed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.590" offset="3289736">Now the Government has authorized a right to appeal, one, when -- on a decision or judgment setting aside or dismissing any indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.892" offset="3342921">Two, on a judgment setting aside a conviction because of insufficiency of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.926" offset="3371029">And three, where the defendant has not been put into jeopardy and a decision sustaining a motion in bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.955" offset="3399241">Now, one and three of these situations are before verdict appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.922" offset="3419094">Only number two is an after verdict appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.401" offset="3436962">Also, 18 U.S.C. 1404 allows before verdict appeals on motions to suppress evidence in certain narcotics cases and Internal Revenue cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.539" offset="3477504">In fact, I believe that we can say that it is the rule rather than the exception that if the Government has the right to appeal, it is in before verdict circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.482" offset="3513344">Therefore, I think that by including this language in 37 (a) (2), we have again manifested the court's intention that 37 (a) (2) apply both to before verdict appeals and after verdict appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.029" offset="3567470">Now, I think it can be argued that 1404 and 3731 which gives the Government the right to appeal within themselves carry a 30-day appeal provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.151" offset="3623999">However, I do not believe that this lessens the effect of 37 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="885.598" offset="3645733">I think that 37 (a) (2) can well be viewed as being a backstop or insurance for any appellate proceedings that might be given to the Government and the fact that 30-day provision is included in 1404 and 3731 of Title 18, does not in anyway lessen the effect of 37 (a) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="919.188" offset="3780106">I will concede that -- well, let me state first that the Fifth Circuit in holding that the appeal was timely filed, unfortunately did not see fit to state what rule is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.025" offset="3851473">Therefore, I believe, we have to accept one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.091" offset="3863698">Either there is no time limit for filing an appeal in this case or the civil rules, Rule 73 (a) which would allow 30 days to file has to be accepted as being the rule that we're concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.182" offset="3924093">I believe that neither of this -- either of this is true, I think 73 (a) is clearly not applicable because it by its own nature states that it is limited only to a -- to the case of a civil nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.211" offset="4004237">Now, we come then to the alternative that there is no time limit for filing an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.599" offset="4025762">I don't believe that this is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.279" offset="4032449">Now, the defendants or the respondents suggest that mandamus is the appropriate method of review in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.389" offset="4064946">But I do not believe that mandamus is the appropriate method here.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.486" offset="4089292">I believe that this Court and the Court of Appeals have the right to issue mandamus relief under 1651 of Title 28 under the old section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.502" offset="4141432">But I don't believe that we should be concerned with whether the power exists but whether or not this case is an appropriate case for the exercise of that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.416" offset="4185004">Traditionally, mandamus has been used to confine a -- inferior court to an exercise of its lawful jurisdiction, or on the other hand, to compel it to exercise that jurisdiction whether it is its duty to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.309" offset="4256580">In Bankers Life and Casualty versus Harlan, the District Court ordered a severance and transfer of a case because of improper venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.860" offset="4302764">And this Court held that mandamus was not the proper method of review because the decision of the lower court on a question of law decisive of the issue was made in the exercise of that court's jurisdiction, to decide issues properly brought before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.355" offset="4376743">In its decision, even if erroneous, involved no abuse of judicial power and therefore, it was not reviewable by mandamus but reviewable instead by appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.567" offset="4433690">In Roche versus Evaporated Milk, this Court held that, again, that the lawful exercise of court's jurisdiction involved no abuse of discretion or usurpation of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.405" offset="4488965">And Roche further set down three points, guidelines of which the Court should use in determining whether the extraordinary remedy of mandamus lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.818" offset="4526686">And those guidelines were that the trial judge act within his jurisdiction, did his act or omission, thwart or tend to thwart appellate review, and third, that mandamus could not be used as a substitute for the appellate procedures prescribed by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.800" offset="4602546">And I submit that the case that we have here is exactly in point with the Roche case and with the Bankers Life and Casualty Company and also with -- in Ex parte Roe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.983" offset="4655313">What Judge Sloan had done here was to do exactly what he was required to do, and that is to rule upon the removability that was before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.044" offset="4691571">He was in -- since exercising his jurisdiction -- and as exercising that jurisdiction, he made the decision to remand them back to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.138" offset="4739950">He had not usurped any of his power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.776" offset="4750503">He had not abused any of his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.765" offset="4762415">As I say, he has fallen immediately within the guidelines of the Roche framework that is he has not afforded appellate review because appellate review has been provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.611" offset="4801808">I believe that under 1447 (d), the remand could be properly reviewed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.528" offset="4841514">Also, the remand could be taken up to the state court system, and after going to the state court system, then come for a final review to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.664" offset="4877981">So, there has been no affording of appellate review in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.548" offset="4893550">Furthermore, the appeal procedures provided are quite adequate and I think this is well attested to by the number of cases that has been cited in the petitioner's brief that have been brought before this Court and have been decided such as Neal versus Delaware, Smith versus Mississippi -- all reached this Court via the appeals route through the state court system and ultimately for final appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.644" offset="5009951">Therefore, I suggest to you gentlemen that 37 (a) (2) is applicable to this proceeding and therefore the cases should be -- the Court of Appeals should be overruled and the remand order of Judge Sloan sustained and that -- the case was allowed to be sent back to the Fulton County District Court.</text>
