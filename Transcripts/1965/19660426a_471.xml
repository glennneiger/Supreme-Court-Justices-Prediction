            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">The City of Greenwood, Mississippi, Petitioner versus Willie Peacock et al and number 649, Willie Peacock et al., Petitioners versus City of Greenwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.340" offset="168730">Mr. Lott.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hardy Lott</label>
            <text syncTime="18.297" offset="176567">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.307" offset="192554">In this case, Peacock and 13 others filed a removal petition in the Federal District Court, alleging that they were being prosecuted in a police court of the City of Greenwood for blocking public streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.324" offset="260681">The District Court remanded the cases to the police court on the face of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.405" offset="288998">They appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which held that the allegations of the petition were sufficient, if proved, to make other case for removal under the first section of 28 U.S.C. 1443 and they reversed the case and remanded it to the District Court for the District Court to hear evidence to see if Peacock and those could prove the allegations of their petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.100" offset="419819">The Peacock petition alleges very little about the substance of the allegations are -- that Peacock -- the petitions are identical so only one is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.086" offset="483767">The allegations are that Peacock is a member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee which is associated with COFO and that they were engaged in civil rights work in assisting Negroes to register to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.633" offset="569866">They then alleged that they were arrested for blocking public streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.763" offset="598392">They draw the conclusion and make the conclusionary allegation that because, well first, that the statute is being applied to them in support of a policy of segregation of the State of Mississippi and City of Greenwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.481" offset="677282">They then make the conclusionary allegation that because of their prosecution, because of the above that they are denied and cannot enforce in Court the equal rights of citizens under the Constitution in 42 U.S.C. 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.666" offset="758053">Now the other cases were combined here.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.553" offset="769546">Those came along later, there were 15 defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.867" offset="786892">They alleged prosecution in the police court of Greenwood for various offenses on different dates, assault and battery, driving a car with an improper license, reckless driving, matters of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.423" offset="853034">The District Court did the same thing with those cases, remanded them on the face of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.071" offset="875708">They came up in the Circuit Court of Appeals later in the Peacock case so that there was no briefing and no argument in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.552" offset="901622">They sustained a summary motion to reverse on the ground that it was controlled by Peacock.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.353" offset="928789">Now what we were concerned with here in the Peacock case is the removal statute, 1443.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.719" offset="970271">Now it's settled law that this Court only has such jurisdiction in the removal case as Congress has conferred upon it, as conferred upon the federal courts and the question here is what jurisdiction Congress can put by the first section of 1443.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.741" offset="1050311">Now that Section gives a person a right to remove in a civil or criminal prosecution, brought against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the Courts of such state, a right on any law providing for the equal rights of citizens of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.921" offset="1135052">Now the point that I want to emphasize in that is what I think the Court of Appeals overlooked is the language in that statute “who is denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such statement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="272.778" offset="1194506">Now the statute provides that in order to remove, you have to file your removal petition before the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.243" offset="1236302">So -- that this Court has held that being true and that's the statute, you have to allege facts in advance of a trial to show that in the state court, you will be denied or cannot enforce some equal civil right.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.367" offset="1320835">This Court therefore held in eight cases mentioned in the previous argument beginning with Strauder versus West Virginia and Virginia versus Rives on the same date and going down through Kentucky versus Powers that since that is true that you have to file your petition and allege and show in advance that you're going to be denied or cannot enforce an equal civil right in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.790" offset="1438490">That therefore, it was not the intention of Congress by that statute to take care of any deprivation of rights that might come up on the trial for the first time because you wouldn't know that until it happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.938" offset="1487078">That you had to be able to point it in advance that you would be denied or can enforce in the courts of a state an equal civil right and that the only way you could do that is where there was a statute or constitutional provision of the State which if the state court followed would obligate it to deny use on the equal civil right.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.351" offset="1580805">Now in the absence of that, this Court has held in those eight cases or in the last seven at least, that you can't remove underneath that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.038" offset="1635558">They specifically held that if a subordinate officer undertakes to deprive a defendant of his equal civil rights in advance of trial by a person who is stacking the grand jury, refusing to put anybody on the grand jury if it's colored defendant except White people, that doesn't show that he is going to be denied or can't enforce his equal civil rights in the state court because the presumption is that the Court will correct that.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.759" offset="1762408">That if it's a matter of stacking the grand jury that the Court when the trial comes on will sustain a motion to quash the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.488" offset="1797308">If it's a matter of petit jury, the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.792" offset="1806503">So that this Court held and it seems to me they were obligated to do it under the statute, but in any event, they held it eight times that you couldn't remove underneath the statute without showing in advance that you're going to be denied or couldn't enforce your rights in state court and that the only way you could show that is if there was a constitutional provision or statute of the state which if followed by the state court would have that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.225" offset="1916322">Now that -- those decisions have been criticized by those who want more removal on the ground that is a restrictive interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.642" offset="1953938">Well it doesn't seem that way to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.971" offset="1963238">It seems to me that this Court went pretty far when it held that they weren't go and presume that the state court would do what it should do and disregard an invalid state statute and follow the paramount federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.340" offset="2032724">But that they would indulge in the presumption that the state court being bound by state law if there was a state statute or constitutional provision that they would say the state court was going to follow it and give the defendant the benefit of that presumption and permit him to remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.765" offset="2102418">Now the Circuit Court of Appeals in this case, we submit with difference, completely overlooked that portion of the statute in the Peacock case.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.021" offset="2143483">That is the portion that the denial or inability enforced has got to be in court and they completely, in our opinion, disregarded the eight decisions of this Court to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.260" offset="2196459">What they held in the Peacock case was that the very institution of the prosecution would enable you to remove on allegation that the prosecution was instituted for an improper motive to deprive use of civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.874" offset="2266885">In other words, what the Circuit Court of Appeals held was this that in this case where the arrest and charges were made by a policemen and I believe the alleged policemen and officers of the county, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that that was sufficient if an allegation that they were made by them for an improper motive to arrest them and exercise of their civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.935" offset="2367091">Now the statute doesn't allege -- I mean the removal petition doesn't contain such an allegation but the Circuit Court of Appeals applied this notice type pleading doctrine and said they would infer that that's what the Peacock and all of those would contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.570" offset="2425605">So they held that the mere institution of the prosecution by a policemen was sufficient to remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.305" offset="2452564">Now just as a matter of common sense and logic, we submit that the institution of a prosecution or the making of a charge or an improper charge, if you please, by a policemen, does not show that you're deprived or cannot enforce your rights in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.116" offset="2535842">As held by this Court, the presumption is if there's something improper in there, if he's brought a charge that he should not have brought, the presumption is that the state court will sustain you and as such there's no way to say that the charge by a policemen means, it's a proof that you're denied or can't enforce your rights in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.865" offset="2614836">Now if you replace the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.909" offset="2619016">Suppose that some federal marshal may enforce arrest or arrest a man with safe and improper motive, that certainly no proof that you are denied or can enforce your equal civil rights in the federal court and the same thing is true in this case, in the case of a policeman, but in any event, whether it's true or not, this Court has so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.952" offset="2715146">Now this Court so held in seven cases that where a subordinate state officer packed the grand jury by illegally excluding colored persons from the grand jury and also the petit jury that the case was not removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.837" offset="2790693">Now in that case, a charge was brought by a grand jury that it was improperly selected in violation of federal law and packed and they brought the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.217" offset="2840221">This Court held in those seven cases that that case was not removal because that did not show that you were denied or couldn't enforce your rights in state court that the presumption was a state court would enforce your rights and would quash the indictment as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.457" offset="2905213">Now the Circuit Court of Appeals in Peacock is no doubt about their holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.131" offset="2931858">If you'll read their opinion carefully, it's hard to believe that they even realized that this denial and enforcement had to be in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.012" offset="2975431">In any event, they came out with just a flat holding that a prosecution for an improper motive instituted to deprive you of your civil rights made out a case of removal.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.605" offset="3157765">Now in each one of those seven cases that I'm talking about, the man had been deprived of his equal civil rights by stacking the grand jury on and it didn't relate to a court, those cases, all seven of them would have been removed, but this Court held that that language and you can read it that way, applies to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.273" offset="3244492">Now let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.949" offset="3259120">I don't think that this Court should sustain the Court of Appeals in the Peacock case for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.952" offset="3303215">In the first place, if you do, you would have to overrule seven decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.093" offset="3327770">You have to overrule that part of the decision holding that under subsection (1) the denial or inability to enforce had to be shown by a state statute or constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.413" offset="3381060">You would have to overrule that.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.340" offset="3388688">You would have to overrule your own opinions in those seven cases that the acts of state officers in depriving you of your rights in advance of trial were not sufficient for removal because the presumption is the state court will correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.260" offset="3460368">Now those decisions of this Court have been in effect and have been a settled law since at least 1879.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.690" offset="3498088">During that period of time, Congress has not made any significant changes in the wording of that statute that would affect those decisions and Congress having conferred the removal of jurisdiction and having acquiesced in that interpretation since at least 1879.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.066" offset="3591607">I submit that it will be too late now to come in for this statute -- I mean for this Court to do what Congress has failed to do and that is to amend the statute and that's what he's arguing you should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.265" offset="3640404">Now, in addition to that, I want to direct the Court's attention to this that in considering the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress had previously reenacted this statute a number of times without changing the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.963" offset="3699231">In 1964, they have their specific attention directed to it in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.888" offset="3718875">They amended the companion statute that enabled you to appeal from a remand order under 1443.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.234" offset="3760358">Prior to that, you couldn't appeal so Congress had its particular attention directed to it and made the amendment permitting an appeal from a remand order in a civil rights case under 1443.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.616" offset="3809886">Now in that same session of Congress, I found out that two of the lawyers whose names assigned to the brief of Peacock, appeared before Congress and advocated the amendment of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.243" offset="3884387">And Mr. [Inaudible] introduced it and his citation is in the reply brief of Peacock.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.473" offset="3909256">A statute before Congress to amend that statute and make it do precisely what the Court of Appeals and the Fifth Circuit held in Peacock it did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.798" offset="3942588">And that is to make any denial of right whether by a court or administrative officer or whatnot removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.978" offset="3975293">Now Congress didn't do that. Congress failed to pass that statute in 1964.</text>

            <text syncTime="1359.324" offset="5540655">But under the decisions of this Court in those seven cases, Congress hasn't given you a removal of jurisdiction in those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.877" offset="5566882">Now let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.433" offset="5573151">In the beginning in 1866, they did when the statute was first enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.502" offset="5593422">In 1866, you could remove a case after the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.177" offset="5616097">You could not only remove it before, but after the trial in a state court, if you had been denied of some equal civil right, then you could remove it to federal court and have a trial all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.791" offset="5666565">But the Congress repealed that in 1874 and they left the statute as it is now as interpreted by this Court that your only time for removal is in advance of the trial in showing these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.864" offset="5718810">Now getting back to my point and I think this was important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.521" offset="5733439">Any defendant on the Peacock can remove that case to a federal court by a simple allegation he's engaged in civil rights and he's been arrested and that the prosecution was for an improper motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.914" offset="5778996">Now, you then are going to have one trial and possibly two trials in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.537" offset="5805537">Your first is going to be a trial to examine the motive of whoever brought the charge whether it's a grand jury or police officer or what not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.508" offset="5841377">Under the Peacock rule, the Court would have to decide that before it knew whether it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.398" offset="5860916">It would hear the evidence as to the motive of whoever brought the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.307" offset="5884635">Now that could involve a quite of lengthy thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.225" offset="5896234">And what I want to say is that the burden is not only on the Federal District Court to try all these police court cases from over parking and driving without a license, the burden on a municipality to enforce a law is just beyond its ability to reach in most towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.830" offset="5958719">I don't know about Washington and Philadelphia, but they would have to do is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.578" offset="5977736">You have to go to a federal court which is probably some distance from your town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.620" offset="5993827">You have to hire a lawyer of course to represent you in federal court and you have to take witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.048" offset="6011591">Now, if there's a motive of the prosecutor like in these cases, you have to transport your witnesses, your policeman there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.122" offset="6035832">You'd probably have to have the mayor and police commissioner to testify about the policy of the city and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.158" offset="6064044">You would have all of that hearing to decide the motive of the prosecutor or the motive of the grand jury or whoever brought the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.780" offset="6094451">Now suppose then that the Court decided that the motive was not bad to deter to exercise some civil rights then he would remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.066" offset="6127679">But if he decided that the motive of the prosecutor was bad, then a removal jurisdiction would be established under the Peacock case and then you would have a trial on the merits to see whether he's guilty or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.498" offset="6165400">Because after all, the motive of the policeman in charging this man who's blocking the street or was driving without a proper license on his automobile may have been as bad as can be but that doesn't mean he's not guilty of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.161" offset="6527979">It's not the motive of the prosecutor, but the question as to whether the state statute has been applied here so as to deprive the accused of his equal civil rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.420" offset="6717001">As I read it in one place here in discussing the Fifth Circuit's decision in Rachel, he says that the teaching of Rachel is that you're to construe the state statute as if there were a gloss on it saying that this statute may not be applied in peaceful city and demonstrations reading from page 26 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.637" offset="7141961">Well now, in the seven cases that was decided by this Court Your Honor, those law of state statutes, one against murder, one against rape and the charge in that case in all of those seven cases was improperly brought by the grand jury in the sense that the court officers stacked that grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.854" offset="7210820">So under any state statute, murder and rape and so forth, I don't see the distinction that he is attempting to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.443" offset="7249168">I can't see why if the grand jury stacked on you and you indicted underneath a state statute, that's not removable but if a police officer comes in and does it and does it for an improper motive with no indictment that therefore that makes it removable and I just can't follow him on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.943" offset="7327117">Now in substance, what we contend about Section 1 is that, as I've stated that the statute says “And I can't enforce him in the state court, this Court has so interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.009" offset="7407365">All the courts in United States have followed that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.542" offset="7861582">What we're looking for in this case, Willie Peacock and the 13 people that were arrested with him is a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.202" offset="7900139">What we can't get in Mississippi state courts is a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.105" offset="7923754">That was what Congress had on its mind in 1866 when it passed this civil rights removal bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.519" offset="7953429">This civil rights removal bill was the third part of the first Civil Rights Act and it simply said that colored people, Negroes and newly freed slaves are going to have to be brought up to the level of a White man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.405" offset="8009017">This was the intent of the 39th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.185" offset="8020093">It was the intent of the Fourteenth, Thirteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.412" offset="8037021">It was the philosophy of the age that the Negro was going to be brought up to the level of the White man and if the federal power was going to see to it that this happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.112" offset="8079862">And what happened in this situation was they passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and it said, Negroes are going to have the same right as White people and the federal government is going to see to it that if any of these rights are deprived, people can be prosecuted, that was the second section of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.944" offset="8147153">The third section said if there's going to be any prosecution of these Negroes and the unionists, there's going to be removal into the federal courts where they can get a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.134" offset="8179858">Everybody knew in 1866 that the Negroes, if they were going to be tried by these reconstructionists or obstructionists state governments, they were going to be tried by ex-confederate judges and that the Negroes weren't going to get a fair trial and that any White man in the South that took the union calls will never get a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.280" offset="8268466">That was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.856" offset="8274840">They tried to rescue slavery in Mississippi in 1865 and they just barely missed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.616" offset="8297827">They couldn't repeal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.311" offset="8308590">The courts that Freedmen's courts that were set up in Mississippi phased themselves out in early 1865 so that there was no longer any control over how Negroes were going to be tried and there was no review of the method about which they were going to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.032" offset="8371493">The same things that that Congress in 1866 was talking about, is in Mississippi today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.077" offset="8399705">It was in Mississippi in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.206" offset="8408168">I was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.185" offset="8412139">That's where these prosecutions came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.473" offset="8425305">Negroes and civil rights workers in Mississippi are not going to get fair trials in those state courts and they don't get them because they don't have Negroes on juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.945" offset="8463130">They have White judges, White prosecutors, White jurymen, White sheriff that are all elected by White electorates from which Negroes are eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.695" offset="8506180">Negroes are gradually getting their right to vote under the new Act but they're long way from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.313" offset="8528645">There are nearly 400,000 Negroes that I think are eligible to vote under the provisions of the new Act in Mississippi and there's not 85,000 registered yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.967" offset="8571277">The whole idea of the Mississippi plan of 1890 was to keep Negroes off those juries by keeping them off the voting rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.343" offset="8604714">Now the only thing that we say is that the Congress said that this was not an Act passed in 1866 for the civil rights movement or for civil rights people just about themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.368" offset="8652884">I don't agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.221" offset="8660302">I don't agree with the previous argument that this was an Act passed that would allow removal when somebody goes out and does something consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment or does something consistent with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.227" offset="8716309">I say it was passed for the Negro who couldn't get a fair trial in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.182" offset="8740133">That was one they passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.131" offset="8747865">Now what that means is that they're going to send -- under this interpretation, their recent powers put on this thing, they can't get a fair trial and a fair federal tribunal unless the state so dumb that they passed an Act that says Negroes can't serve on the juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.410" offset="8817037">And no state -- no southern court -- is that enough, there's no southern state government is going to do anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.673" offset="8850056">They've learned their lesson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.742" offset="8858311">The whole philosophy here was that the legal machinery of the states, the reconstructive states, the ex-confederate state was that they're going to use the federal power, I mean the state power to prosecute the unionists in their midst and the Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.618" offset="8933857">What happened after the Civil War was that the Negroes were freed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.153" offset="8951933">There were hundreds of thousands of them roaming the south without any education, without any money, without any jobs, without any homes and they passed these Black Codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.877" offset="8990908">These Black Codes are just about like the Slave Codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.011" offset="8999372">The only thing that it didn't have is it didn't say slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.861" offset="9010866">That was the only difference and the Negro had to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.772" offset="9026435">He had to have a labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.936" offset="9035107">He had to indenture his children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.010" offset="9043362">He had to pay a head tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.927" offset="9051094">He couldn't move around without a travel permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.495" offset="9065305">He was a class of indentured servants and when he was prosecuted for not doing these things, the federal law says he had the right to remove them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.665" offset="9098010">That's what that second section of 1443 means in addition to the fact that the prosecutor, the federal officers and the state officers are trying to do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.810" offset="9138657">What I'm saying here is that if we don't give some meaning to this federal removal statute then there's no use talking about equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.384" offset="9176900">If a man is going to -- what they were going to do and what they did do and what they're doing in Mississippi now and what they're doing in parts of Louisiana now is they're prosecuting people for civil rights activity and they just go out and pick up a Negro who is not involved in the civil rights movement, he's got a prosecution against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.377" offset="9240848">They can't get a fair trial because they're Black and civil rights people who are white can get a fair trial because they're coming down there from the north and all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.571" offset="9269687">So what they do is in trial within a state court where they've got a built-in decision and they know they're going to convict them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.622" offset="9305840">No lawyers in the community are going to represent them because it's not popular to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.828" offset="9330709">What happens is, they can't get a proper counsel and they get convicted and they get high bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.032" offset="9359548">They get -- you've got two cases up here now asking for certiorari from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.449" offset="9377207">One is Baines, that's the Danville case and one is Bowman out of Montgomery, out of [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.205" offset="9408240">If you read those cases, you'll find out the judge comes to court with a pistol, if a searcher by walks into the courtroom, search the brief cases, search the persons, there are policemen standing around with guns on, you can't get a fair trial in that kind of an atmosphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.643" offset="9469994">That was what the whole removal statute was all about then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.162" offset="9492041">I would have been able to show you something like that too if the district judge below give me an opportunity to get a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.490" offset="9513357">What I'm saying is that I want to be able to take deposition that I can show than in Leflore County, Negroes don't serve on juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.430" offset="9553063">Negroes who are beat up and shot at the night, they were arrested when they try to register to vote, that was what they were doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.608" offset="9589844">They were -- what happened in these cases, I'll tell you what Willie Peacock was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.780" offset="9606457">He wasn't trying to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.004" offset="9611368">He was trying to see if the law was followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.380" offset="9620877">He wasn't out just demonstrating to them to block the city sidewalks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.338" offset="9640730">They found that if they wanted Negroes to register so as to in an orderly fashion change the policy and the government of the State of Mississippi and bring it into the 20th Century where it belongs that you're going to have to have Negroes register and vote so that the voting processes that makes this country great.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.029" offset="9707499">The democratic processes of a vote means something to people so that there is some participation in Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.397" offset="9732995">That's what they were trying to do and they found that if they went to a Negro who lived on a farm and said, uncle or aunt, friend or brother, whoever it was miss so and so, mister so and so, come on down and vote and they're going to say, we're scared to go to that White man's courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.259" offset="9792449">I'll tell you when I was getting into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.502" offset="9797360">That's just a big white man's courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.884" offset="9806869">That's all the law means to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.083" offset="9815751">He just got a bad yawn and you better look out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.282" offset="9828498">Don't hang around there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.085" offset="9831737">That's just where you pay your taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.766" offset="9842395">So what the civil rights workers were saying was, okay if you're scared to go, we'll go with you and we'll be there with you and we'll show them that if we have the courage to go with you, maybe you'll have the courage to go down and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.936" offset="9903104">So what they do is they put on a freedom day and they marched around that courthouse with a sign which says “one man, one vote” or something about voting and the Negroes would trickle into that registrar's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.413" offset="9957021">And the police would come down and say you're blocking the sidewalk and throw everybody in jail. That's what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.646" offset="9981994">That's what was going on all over Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.785" offset="9990562">Throw them in jail and try them the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.227" offset="10000280">We have to file this removal petition in Peacock.</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.182" offset="11132113">I said, what about the football parade that you have in town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.050" offset="11143607">You know, it's just as bad to block the courthouse for those football parade as it is to blocking with the sign that says “one man one vote”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2782.655" offset="11233991">So as to the kind of hearing that I would undertake Mr. Chief Justice, I would show that kind of selective enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.119" offset="11255829">I would show that Negroes don't serve on the jury and I'd show to the federal court by these experiences of useful -- using the federal rules to develop a record, I'll show that he could not enforce in the courts of that state equal civil right of having a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3786.741" offset="15250369">I say it applies to all the Negroes who are being prosecuted for failing to do so -- actually in 1866, failing to do something on those Black Codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.137" offset="15283911">Because the Black Codes were enacted in Mississippi in November of 1865, this Act was passed in April of 1866 and the Black Codes were effective January 29th, 1866 and the Black Codes -- the Negro just have to sit around in his living room and do nothing then he's violating about ten of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4297.238" offset="17292309">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.010" offset="17307460">I will turn immediately to the statute and to the several sections of it as we analyze it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.733" offset="17342255">As we see it, the statute states four separate distinct grounds for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.539" offset="17369527">They are incorporated in the four operative clauses of the statute which we label, first, the Denial Clause, secondly, the Inability to Enforce Clause; thirdly, both of those in the first paragraph, in the second paragraph, the Color of Authority Clause and finally the Refusal Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.435" offset="17461164">As we view this case, it turns on only two of those clauses, the first one, the Denial Clause and the third one, the Color of Authority Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.601" offset="17509752">Now counsel for Peacock also invoked the other two clauses in this case, Inability to Enforce Clause and the Refusal Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.766" offset="17558444">I should say something about our view of the scope of those provisions as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.448" offset="17585194">But first, let me distinguish between the clauses in the first paragraph as a group and the clauses in the second paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.617" offset="17621870">The first paragraph very clearly deals with all kinds of cases in which the defendant is denied or unable to enforce in the courts of the states procedural -- primarily procedural rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.036" offset="17687489">It makes no difference out of what context the case arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.587" offset="17705671">In the language of the 1866 Act, it was for any cause whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.314" offset="17736600">The problem dealt with in that clause is, as Mr. Smith says, the unfairness which is anticipated at the trial because of procedural or other rules which may put the defendant to the disadvantage at trial that is at least the primary thrust of the first paragraph as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.075" offset="17843702">The second paragraph on the contrary is not concerned with what happens at Court or what will happen, but is concerned solely with the context out of which the case arises that is the activity for which legal proceeding by the state or by private individual for that matter since this applies as well to civil actions, seeks to interfere or deter and those are the rights provided by the substantive laws providing for equal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.578" offset="18001690">Some of them already outlined in the 1966 Act, others outlined in the Acts of 1870 and 1871 and of course subsequently by laws like the Public Accommodations Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.489" offset="18065324">Now as I say, we argue only under the Denial Clause and under the Color of Authority Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.820" offset="18098657">Within the first paragraph, we do distinguish between the Denial Clause and the Inability to Enforce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.695" offset="18130108">The Inability to Enforce Clause, it seems to us, deals with an apprehension as to the future deprivation of rights at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.404" offset="18172949">That presents the question of prediction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.565" offset="18185592">It presents a very delicate problem of as Mr. Justice Fortas put it I believe in trying the state court in advance.</text>

            <text syncTime="5032.079" offset="20231711">Now it seems to us that what we contend for under the Color of Authority Clause presents the classical case for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.164" offset="20268074">It follows all of the prior removal statutes in committing removal on the theory that a federal defense is involved and that the issue at trial will turn on the existence of a federal defense based on a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.095" offset="20351770">Indeed the constitutional basis for Section 2, as opposed to Section 1 of 1443, seems to us as directly in Article 3 and does not depend at least on the Fourteenth Amendment except insofar as the Fourteenth Amendment authorizes the laws providing for equal rights which -- on which in one sense it turns.</text>
            <text syncTime="5085.939" offset="20447169">This is an exercise of the power which Congress had from the beginning to provide a federal court trial of all the cases arising under the constitution and laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.913" offset="20495026">That has always been construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.096" offset="20503803">Constitutional Provision has allowing been construed as allowing removal to federal courts of cases in which the federal question was interpose by way of defense rather than by way of complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.816" offset="20558660">Congress has this matter of policy chosen not to exercise that jurisdiction generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.604" offset="20585827">Here, for a good reason, it chose to exercise it in this area of the attempted decision of civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.777" offset="20638490">Also, this Color of Authority Clause seems to us deals with the real problem of today and a problem that was also real in 1866 when the statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.674" offset="20690108">Although at that time, there were other problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.222" offset="20700244">There was the problem of procedural rules that did not permit Negroes to testify or permit them to serve on the juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.537" offset="20741517">And that problem is the risk of an imperceptible and therefore unreviewable as a practical matter, prejudice that may well confront the Negro or those who sympathize and aid with him when he is prosecuted for conduct arising out of his effort to assert his claim to equal rights especially so when that decision is made against an existing White supremacist establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.572" offset="20881638">In so saying, we do not mean to confine the scope of the statute to south rather than north but it is certainly true that the practical operation of the statute maybe far greater in some areas than in others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.803" offset="20958542">Now the defendant may have transgressed the bounds of his federal privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.280" offset="20980485">He may or may not have violated the local law with which he is charged, but in any event he is entitled to removal so long as his petition for removal alleges a case which on its face would require dismissal or acquittal if the allegations are true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.833" offset="21090722">It seems to us that the question whether the allegations are true should be determined as in any other case by the trial jury and not by the judge preliminarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.757" offset="21138369">And so, it seems to us the removal remedy was designed as distinguished from the habeas corpus remedy as distinguished from the injunctive remedy to simply transfer the trial to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.475" offset="21201272">Now that it seems to us is entirely comparable to the diversity removal situation and it is based on a judgment made by Congress as I say an unreasonably that these kinds of cases though not always often might result in unfairness to the defendant in exercising his general jurisdiction to this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.024" offset="21311509">The Congress determined as a matter of precaution to avoid what is viewed as the serious risk of injustice to provide for removal of all such cases on proper pleading to the federal court for a trial there.</text>
