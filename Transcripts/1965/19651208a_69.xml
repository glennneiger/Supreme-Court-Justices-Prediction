            <text syncTime="37.471" offset="253262">These are the prosecuting attorneys which -- as it might develop, the Court will recognize that are nominal parties in interest in this case initially, this case as Mr. Chief Justice had noted, has been consolidated with case Number 69 in involving the Railroad Brotherhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.915" offset="327032">The -- its imparities that I initially address some remarks to the presentation of argument to facilitate the -- that in the transition between my portion of the argument and Mr. Youngdahl's.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.445" offset="385128">I propose to give some maximum of 25 minutes this afternoon, perhaps even less and confine my remarks to the facts of this case that established principle as we see it for the favored status of police power of law and also to treaty in conclusion, the expressed limitation or the arbitration award and the alternative argument that if Public Law 88-108 did supersede the state statutes, if those state statutes are revived at the conclusion or duration of the national award.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.345" offset="548760">My colleague, Mr. Youngdahl, representing the Brotherhoods in the case Number 69 then used the remaining portion of the time for his argument in chief and also rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.180" offset="604139">I understand that he will address himself particularly to the contention of the Brotherhood and also the state by the way that Public Law 88-108 does not impair any of the full-crew statutes nor has any other legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.222" offset="672266">And I understand that Mr. Youngdahl will develop considerable attention in doing that portion of the argument to legislative history in certain concepts that he will offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.301" offset="720541">Finally, Mr. Youngdahl will conclude this portion of the argument on the pros -- proposition, if there is no justifiable inference in this record to merit judicial consideration of the efficacies of the reasonableness of the full-crew statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.313" offset="784593">Inevitably, we suspect there will be some overlapping but we've given this as a guide to benefit ourselves and the Court and also the appellees in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.643" offset="837987">I wish to deal first very briefly with the facts and the history of this litigation and the apparent conflict of laws that has arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.672" offset="882082">The two Arkansas statutes that are challenged here and were determined to be preempted by the District Court are Act 116 of 1907 and Act 67 of 1913, both these being Arkansas statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.645" offset="953971">Act 116 requires in essence the freight trains consisting of over 25 cars operated in Arkansas on a line that has over 50 miles of trackage in the state, must have a crew of an engineer, a fireman, a conductor, and three freight men.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.731" offset="1030248">Similarly, Act 67 which is in exception also requires at any railroad that operates more than a 100 miles of trackage within the state should not switch or transport cars at public crossings in cities of either first or second class with less than an engineer, a fireman, a foreman, and three helpers.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.616" offset="1117811">The third statute which perpendicularly is not an issue here and I think that of itself is a -- some significance, is the order of the three statutes, Act 298 of 1909 references mentioned, yes, in the briefs, and that statute provide for a minimum crew on passenger trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.751" offset="1202343">There are at this time to my best account approximately nine states in the union that have that full-crew requirements of varying sorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.300" offset="1252603">I dare say that in addition to those nine states, there are still some other states I become aware of that have given authority to commissions or other regulatory bodies to establish for the amount to full-crew requirements.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="307.044" stopTime="309.082">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="307.044" offset="1331597">How many states did you say?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_l_lessenberry" startTime="309.082" stopTime="324.431">

            <text syncTime="309.082" offset="1339747">I believe there are about nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.746" offset="1346330">Apparently, there's even a controversy there Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.602" offset="1357824">I referred at one time -- point to perhaps a dozen.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.587" offset="1377677">I notice the appellees refer to seven and I know there's (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack L. Lessenberry</label>
            <text syncTime="331.475" offset="1429295">I might add that in North Dakota that -- I believe that the last general election, the people on a referendum abolished their full-crew laws but the Attorney General of North Dakota advises me that there are some concepts of that law that they believe are still enforceable and they maintain that they did still have some attitude of full-crew requirement even in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.829" offset="1514663">So, I suppose it would not be an overstatement to offer at this point that the status in effect of full-crews throughout the United States is in a fairly definite status of chaos.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.740" offset="1578297">Something must now be said of the advance leading to the presentation in enactment of Public Law 88-108.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.182" offset="1620093">On July 22, 1963, the President of the United States in an address to the Congress remarked that there had been three and one-half years of constant fruitless attempts to achieve peaceful settlement between the carriers and unions of certain proposed work rule of changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.535" offset="1697520">I believe that this was primarily directed at a fireman issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.186" offset="1716120">He recited some of those efforts made in the past to resolve this conflict and then recommended in the form of proposed legislation that notices be directed to the Interstate Commerce Commission for some sort of interim resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.836" offset="1782680">Now, the Act finally passed by the Congress which I referred to before Public Law 88-108, did not follow completely to suggest another precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.434" offset="1825102">And that substituted in place of the Interstate Commerce Commission, was the creation of an arbitration board and the requirement of compulsory arbitration between the parties that consisted of these operating railroad unions and certain carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.211" offset="1904201">It was provided in Public Law 88-108 that the award was to expire within two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.674" offset="1934085">After the award was made, special provisions were promulgated by Special boards of adjustment that were created across the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.208" offset="1972224">The award was found as directed United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.497" offset="1993331">Thereafter, did result in legis -- litigation involving the brotherhoods and these certain carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.222" offset="2020289">Judge Hollzer, the hearing judge declared, that this award was binding on the brotherhoods and the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.677" offset="2054040">The brotherhoods appeal that decision to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.059" offset="2071594">The decision was affirmed 2 to 1, I believe the chief judge dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.300" offset="2100537">In reference to our particular litigation, in April 1964, the six large interstate railroads filed a complaint to the District Court of Arkansas against the two prosecuting attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.393" offset="2160933">Within whose districts at these railroads operating, I'm sure the complaints fixed better than I have but just in passing reference, the allegations contained in the complaint were the statutes of Arkansas where an improper regulation of commerce constitute a deprivation of property for that due process of law, denied the railroad's equal protection and finally, that the state laws had been preempted by the enactment of Public Law 88-108.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.787" offset="2282559">They further asked that the Arkansas statutes be declared invalid and that the prosecuting attorneys be enjoined from enforcement of its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.573" offset="2317667">And this -- motion was made by the operating brotherhoods to intervene, it was granted, they promptly filed a motion to dismiss which is -- was promptly denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.737" offset="2362284">Then thereafter, a motion for summary judgment was filed by the railroads containing much the similar prayer but more particularly relying upon preemption of the award made under Public Law 88-108.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack L. Lessenberry</label>
            <text syncTime="629.737" offset="2622360">The issue was then submitted on summary judgment to the three-judge court and at that time, to the district judges, found in favor of preemption, the circuit judge dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.330" offset="2676694">Although, it has no place as to the actual merits or consideration of this cause, I think it is remarkable that in terms of dollars of annual salaries in Arkansas, this suit involves perhaps over $6 million in effects near a thousand employees nationally, best guesses are that full-crew laws account for perhaps $75 million each year in paid wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.490" offset="2801351">I have not attempted to compute the number of jobs that might be lost but at stake and most important to the State of Arkansas and to each of the several other states is the question of inherent right of police power to exercise authority and what we'd believe to be a very basic and fundamental obligation of the state to its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.085" offset="2907721">With that brief introduction, I do want to proceed then to discuss -- pardon me, to discuss the initial topic and that is the police power authority.I believe to assure proper perspective in this cause it is necessary that some firm basis be described on which this litigation may be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.920" offset="3019003">It cannot be forgotten but should be kept foremost that the two Arkansas statutes challenged here this afternoon and ruled invalid by the court below bare this Court to prior judicial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.869" offset="3074800">Act -- first act, Act 67 was determined to be valid under attacked, no similar of those here in 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.324" offset="3116701">Act 116, and may have those reversed, also survived a similar attack in the case of St. Louis Iron Mountain and Southern Railway in 1916 before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.274" offset="3164453">Most significantly, both of these statutes again survived identical contetion -- contentions of deprivation and discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.257" offset="3212413">And in addition to that, to be preempted by the Railway Labor Act and the Interstate Commerce Act as late as 1931 in this Court rendered its decision of Missouri Pacific versus Norwood which incidentally was the Attorney General at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.454" offset="3281168">Now, these statutes have as their vitality, the function of operating in behalf not only the welfare and safety of the railroad employees but more importantly in behalf of the traveling public and the general community as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.958" offset="3347205">And this has been so often repeated that hardly requires reiteration in my part.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.848" offset="3366745">But in view of the -- taken by the appellees that their brief is so easily and carelessly described, the Arkansas statutes as having the sole benefit of providing jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.238" offset="3420348">I do think it's necessary to make some sort of comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.431" offset="3433096">Indeed, the appellees and I believe it was in the one the amica briefs, made the statement that the statutes have no relation to safety at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.477" offset="3481266">Now, in this regard, it would appear in due of attack employed before the District Court by proceeding by summary judgment in evading, thus evading a trial on the merits which had benefited in some sort of conclusion of the actual relationship of these statutes to safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.835" offset="3562663">That the appellees have forfeited this right to actually complain of whether not these state statutes have as their basis any matter of public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.006" offset="3607385">I think this is true to the matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.655" offset="3618043">Now, on basis of this appeal, I think that there is the continuing presumption as there has been since 1911 that the Arkansas statutes are reasonable, that they are just and they are dedicated to the end of providing safety for the benefit and welfare of the citizens of State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.159" offset="3699963">At least, this concept we keep consistent with the concession made by the appellees that full-crew statutes in regard to passenger trains are desirable, they have not been attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.431" offset="3777076">In the connection also, it may be conceded that Congress could have in its discretion exercised complete dominion over the field of interstate railroads and crew concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.282" offset="3824515">I think all the parties are agreed on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.127" offset="3835904">The Congress and the opinion of the appellants, has failed to exercise his authority and the courts have consistently adhered to the concept of refraining from seeking a conflict of state and federal laws unless compelled by the circumstances which demand preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.467" offset="3921272">I hope that this very brief of almost perfunctory treatment, if I may, will not be leveled the magnitude of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.619" offset="3953873">I want to abandon it now and proceed to the discussion to the final proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.124" offset="3991907">That is the point of revival of state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.247" offset="4004342">At topic three of the appellate's brief there's offered an alternative type of argument that should this Court determine that Public Law 88-108 and the award made there under, it must be preempted -- excuse me, must preempt state crew laws, then we urge that the District Court's judgment holding that these laws will not be not revived at the termination of the award, we hope -- we urge that that be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.345" offset="4136730">Now, we base this argument upon two main principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.283" offset="4492518">But I think there are number of reasons why we should not and the Court ought not to be concerned with what will happen in those case -- states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.646" offset="4562004">I don't believe that the railroad seriously believed that there will evade the collective bargaining table forever in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.060" offset="4599620">Secondly, I think this is another issue which I hate to speculate or has it I guess but I don't believe that anyone seriously believes that in view of the reason advanced that the brotherhood will demand and receive the status of crew compliment comparable to what they had in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.733" offset="4690317">I think that Public Law 88-108 and the history and Mr. Youngdahl will treat that more appropriately confirms the fact that this was only stopped or an interim type of solution to an age-old problem that once the parties had reached some sort of plateau, even through compulsory arbitration, that they would be permitted then in the future to bargain collectively, to use the powers economically that are -- are available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.473" offset="4849246">And I don't foresee, and it is conjectural on my part, that after the efforts of the Board in this litigation and the judicial consideration, that we're going to be back in those states where there are not full-crew statutes with a fireman's helper, three brakemen on the train.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.640" offset="5137951">But that until that the parties consisting of the carriers and the brotherhoods reach an agreement is a matter of collective bargaining between those parties alone and would not involve state or state statutes and if I may, in conclusion, make some reference to our feeling at what ought to be the operation of this law in states that have full-crew laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.346" offset="5272743">We believe that it is inconceivable or rather inconceivable that the Congress would make such a definitive duration of a award for two years and require that the railroads expend large sums of money or discharged employees or give them enabled transfers and then put them back in the position of status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.594" offset="5369710">And we think that perhaps the best answer to this argument and the only logical one, is that Congress in the first place did not obtain for the award to act in this area of full-crew states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.971" offset="5767293">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.979" offset="5779310">In my argument, I hope to demonstrate that the essence of a Supremacy Clause preemption inquiry is find out what Congress intended at the most authoritative indication of what Congress intended as to Public Law 88-108 as found in the legislative history of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.301" offset="5860603">That the reading of a legislative history leaves no doubt that Congress intended with thought on the matter not that preempt and that in the face of this intent, clearly demonstrated the railroads are asking this Court to make a policy decision overseeing of legislative branch which this Court have rejected in other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.060" offset="5963630">As does Mr. Lessenberry, the brotherhoods concede that, of course, Congress has the power to preempt, however, the state full-crew laws may be characterized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.689" offset="6006157">We understand the decisions of this Court to say that a preemption inquiry as to determine what was the measurement of the occupation of the field, what was the measurement of Congress' action?</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.603" offset="6061746">And the mechanics of that inquiry as we understand it, in determining the intent of Congress, are first to look at the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.177" offset="6096123">Now, the full-crew laws are not referred to in the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.880" offset="6114931">And both sides have been able to cite cases saying that since there has no reference, therefore, it's preempted, or therefore, it's not preempted and indeed there are cases on both sides by this Court depending upon the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.393" offset="6172923">There are two contextual factors here which we urge upon the Court as being a vital significance in showing that a failure to mention state full-crew laws indicates an intent not to preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.400" offset="6228929">The first of these is the history of consideration of full-crew laws by this Court which Mr. Lessenberry described to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.725" offset="6262262">They've been up here repeatedly and repeatedly this Court has denied preemption and other arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.503" offset="6289429">I do not bring this up in the sense of suggesting that the Court is bound by the past decisions, but I do bring it up in the sense of suggesting that Congress relied on them and particularly in Norwood case in 1931 where the key statement on preemption by this Court was, that unless Congress and until Congress expressly so says so, full-crew laws remain in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.864" offset="6402800">That statement was presented to the House of Committee on Commerce, the Senate Committee on Congress, it was presented on the floor of Congress, it was presented in memorandums, submitted to Congress during the processing or Public Law 88-108.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.765" offset="6462464">It was the statement which was repeatedly brought to attention of Congress and obviously the statement on which Congress relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.812" offset="6490572">And the second contextual factor which as a matter fact, occurred to me since my briefs in this case, is that the last major piece of railway labor legislation that was passed by the United States Congress was in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.041" offset="6551489">When the Railway Labor Act itself was amended in order to allow union shop, the union security devices, and obviously, there a possible question of preemption is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.886" offset="6606869">As this course can -- Court, considered the matter in the Hanson case which is cited by the appellees frequently, the key point as a context to not mentioning preemption in Public Law 88-108.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.968" offset="6655248">The key point is that the 1951 Amendment start out by saying, “Notwithstanding the laws of any state, the brotherhood and the railroads may negotiate a union security provision”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.727" offset="6710314">This was the last piece of legislation prior to Public Law 188 in the general field of labor-management relations in the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.859" offset="6742810">And again, a strong indication it seems to us, that Congress by not mentioning full-crew laws intended not to preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.932" offset="6775097">But more than that, the legislative history which I hope to be able to deal with in detail in a few minutes was definitive and comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.645" offset="6805922">I cannot candidly conceive of a person reading that legislative history which to be sure is extensive and coming out with the idea that any member of Congress who consider the question and many did, many did expressly could've conceive of the fact that Congress was preempting full-crew laws and as enactment of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.369" offset="6904874">Revolving as it was to say, the history does around the Norwood case in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.243" offset="6924309">The railroads urged upon this Court what the Court has called subsidiary test of supersession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.619" offset="6949804">When Congress has not expressed itself either in the language of the statute or in the legislative history it has been said, “We then examine how the two kinds of enactment work as between themselves are they -- do they clash?</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.407" offset="7009050">Is there a physical impossibility of complaints with both?</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.988" offset="7023365">Is the federal legislation so pervasive as to make the implication clear that Congress did not intend to preempt?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.094" offset="7051786">I don't think we need to get to those things in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.807" offset="7062549">But in the event that we do, it seems to me that the subsidiary test of supersession bare out the primary test --</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.925" offset="7323042">Secondly, Section 3 of Public Law 88-108, refers to two particular issues and assigns to the Arbitration Board jurisdiction over this -- those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.190" offset="7368182">Those issues are well-defined, first of all, by the notices of the party which started this whole dispute back in 1959 and 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.862" offset="7398797">Those in order said, do not refer to state full-crew laws and in fact the railroads testified during the consideration of 88-108 that they could not negotiate away and had no idea of being able to negotiate away the state full-crew laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.279" offset="7452505">They are just stuck with them until they can go to the legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1885.977" offset="7647274">And it was only within the scope of what the parties might have done that the Arbitration Board acted and the Arbitration Board itself conceded this and said there are many questions of law or policy involving state statutes and other thing we cannot reach.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.890" offset="7802964">That is what the stats -- that is what the railroad themselves say in the legislative history and that's what Congress intended, judging from that history in my view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.514" offset="7841416">Let me proceed -- oh one more on subsidiary test of supersession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.796" offset="7862523">The railroads repeatedly say that the standards of the full-crew laws and the standards of Public -- of the arbitration award are not the same, that is, there are more crew members required by one and by the other or allowed by one and allow the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.088" offset="7923754">After dissenting judge below pointed out and as several state courts have pointed out since then, the two kinds of enactment present minimums.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.964" offset="7967222">There is not a physical impossibility of complaints with both, and in fact, during the past year for example that railroads have complied with both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.404" offset="8000972">It would be entirely different of course if Congress provided for a maximum crew which was less than the minimum crew provided for by the state full-crew laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.132" offset="8039946">Physically, that in terms of exact number, it's going to be impossible to comply with both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.813" offset="8062621">There has been compliance with both and this Court has pointed out in the Florida Lime case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.314" offset="8092609">The fact that the tests are different does not dispose of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.837" offset="8106715">In fact, it poses the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.035" offset="8115493">Now again, these subsidiary tests, we believe, are not even necessary for the Court to reach because the intent of Congress is so clear and it's not necessary to examine what it must have meant if it had thought about the problem or if it were reasonable in dealing with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.298" offset="8188531">Now, as to the specific legislative history, Public Law 88-108 was presented by President Kennedy and he said to the Congress, “We are giving you the entire issue -- the entire series of issues that separate the parties, there are eight or ten separate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.709" offset="8258226">And we are asking that all of these issues be assigned to the Interstate Commerce Commission acting under the Interstate Commerce Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.598" offset="8289782">Congress rejected some of that procedure and some important parts of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.136" offset="8307963">It said, “We don't want the Interstate Commerce Act involved.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.706" offset="8318203">At the behest of the Railway-Brotherhood incidentally, they expressly say, “We're signing this to an ad hoc independent arbitration board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.438" offset="8349132">And secondly, we don't want to go into anymore than we absolutely have to and apparently we only absolutely have to go into two of those eight or ten issues.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.420" offset="8385076">So Congress then assigned to the ad hoc arbitration board, two issues which seem to be the issues which held the arts of collective bargaining apart, those last things which the party have somehow been unable to do for themselves up to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.156" offset="8456025">Now, the administrative intention in this respect, the intention of the administration where the -- on preemption of state full-crew laws specifically was expressed by Secretary of Labor Wirtz, who presented the administration proposal, explained and interpreted it in both houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.742" offset="8534392">His first statement was in the House Representative before the House Commerce Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.579" offset="8549648">And there he said, “The intention of the Administration is not to preempt full-crew laws,” citing again that Norwood opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.666" offset="8582040">And the Norwood statement, that unless Congress says to the contrary that state full-crew law shall be presumed to be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.471" offset="8613282">The House Representatives, Members of the House and Committees repeatedly over and over again said, “One thing we don't want to do, we don't want to preempt full-crew laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.440" offset="8649122">I respectfully direct the attention of the Court to Appendix C in my brief in which I quote verbatim the expressed specific references to full-crew laws in the congressional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.854" offset="8698755">I submit, however, that there are many, many kinds of general expresses of intent such as the desire not to go into great detail, not to have anymore impact on the situation and absolutely necessary which also review in attempt -- intent not to preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.041" offset="8771584">When the House Report came out in the House Floor, Chairman Oren Harris of the House Interstate Commerce Committee, was asked specifically, “What about the effect of this law in Public Law 88-108?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.598" offset="8821739">And he said again, he quoted the Norwood decision of this Court on preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.158" offset="8843995">He said that -- he pointed to the report and the report of the House Committee said, and this was reached in a session in which 31 out of 33 of the committee members were there, they voted unanimously and the report says expressly, “It is not the intent of this Committee to preempt state full-crew laws or to affect to have any effect on --” I think they described the “demanding laws of the various states.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2365.298" offset="9564557">Mr. Shane, one of the leading witnesses for the brotherhoods, said to the Senate Committee, “I think there was a great danger of having the Interstate Commerce Commission handle this dispute because of Section 5-11 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.888" offset="9622967">Maybe this is why the Railroads want the Interstate Commerce Commission to handle it because Section 5-11 does appear to give the power to the railroad, a power to the Interstate Commerce Commission to preempt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.649" offset="9673958">This was also commented on by Mr. Ginane, on behalf of the Interstate Commerce Commission, pointing out that under the Interstate Commerce Act, if Congress was going to key this matter to the Interstate Commerce Act, that they should make sure that Section 5-11, it could probably take the instructions of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.875" offset="9746892">But if they want to make doubly sure, it should say that Section 5-11 does not apply the Public Law 88-108, it would finally come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.311" offset="9780642">Congress did more than take out Section 5-11 of the Interstate Commerce Act, Congress dropped the Interstate Commerce Act altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.399" offset="9812929">And they said in their reports and on the floor, the reason we are dropping reference of the Interstate Commerce Act is because the railway brotherhoods don't want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.393" offset="9848978">And the railway brotherhoods told the Senate Committee is the reason we don't want it, a reason, a detailed explanation of this is because we're afraid the preemptive effect of Section 5-11 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.446" offset="9901119">Now, it seems to us that here again, the Senate joined what was the clear House understanding about this lack of preemptive effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.795" offset="10286582">It was drafted by the White House.</text>

            <label>Mr. James E. Youngdahl</label>
            <text syncTime="2556.992" offset="10331303">Well, the initial draft was presented by the President at the end of his speech which was at the end of August of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.735" offset="10362337">It went to through the two committees, and the major changes that were made by the committees, is that both committees took out the Interstate Commerce Commission and substituted therefore an ad hoc arbitration board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.902" offset="10411029">There was an additional change made first on the Senate floor and then exceeded to on the House floor which cut the issues down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.688" offset="10450108">Exactly where it occurred in the Senate, I don't recall for sure but it was -- I think at the end of or after senate deliberation, which cut the issues down to just the two issues in which the Arbitration Board finally ruled in contrast to the large gamut of issues President Kennedy initially asked Congress to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.705" offset="10538193">The Railroads have responded to the congressional attempt matter by pointing to Mr. Ginane's comments on which I have already referred and also by pointing to a statement of Representative Howard Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.441" offset="10581138">Immediately, after Representative Harris, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee of the House said, “We do not intend to preempt, that's what our report says, that's what Norwood says, this is about as clear as we can make it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.600" offset="10629726">Representative Smith got up and he said, that he thinks that the Constitution, not Public Law 88, the Constitution prevents the states from affecting interstate commerce and that insofar as interstate railroads are concerned, he understand that the Constitution bans this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.310" offset="10704645">I submit, that this, number one, has not responsive to Public Law 88-108 and number two, is contrary to the decision of this Court in which and -- would have made Norwood invalid without any Public Law 88-108.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.360" offset="10776848">It was certainly the understanding of the Arbitration Board that they were not to overrule full-crew laws and they say as a matter of fact in one of their -- in their explanation about their award, they say -- it suggested that we're going to take all kind of people's jobs away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.789" offset="10858559">But the Arbitration Board says, “No, that's not so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.030" offset="10871515">Because of a several factors, one, is a protective provisions, but number two is, the provisions of state full-crew laws which protect people's jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.111" offset="10907773">The Arbitration Board in doing that was echoing what the railroad said to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.816" offset="10926686">They urged Congress, “Please pass this resolution and take us out of this problem about full-crews.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.376" offset="10948838">And then they said to Congress, orally and in written form, as is cited in my brief and again it's in the appendix -- they said, -- everybody said, “We're trying to fool this people out in the street.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.759" offset="10986454">It's not like that at all because 17,000 positions are protected by state full-crew laws that the Arbitration Board can't touch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.982" offset="11019264">So, this Court has noted before in the Chicago River case, it was the understanding of both contending parties in this very hotly contested matter that Congress was not preempting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.140" offset="11067956">And for the railroads now to come and say, “Oh, yes, they were,” is only they are saying in effect we believe that -- a very inconsistent thing to be kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.896" offset="11126993">Now, in conclusion, it is a late blooming argument particularly in the amicus briefs here that by one giant sweep of the judicial sword in this case, we can take care of this whole problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.120" offset="11183835">We cannot only say things about the state full-crew laws; we can talk about whether or not the arbitration award conditions continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.737" offset="11226363">It's the position of the Brotherhoods, they do not continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.648" offset="11237961">And that at the end of the award in early 1966, that the situation prior to the passage of Public Law 88-108 will be reenacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.261" offset="11284459">In any event, Congress is now considering these various -- this very problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.685" offset="11306088">In any event, this matter -- the railroads are now arguing to a Senate Committee and in some of this hearing, they're cited by the railroads in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.282" offset="11340466">Arguing to a Senate Committee, that we better do something about the time when this award expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.451" offset="11365125">Now again, this, it seems to us, is a matter for Congress to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.537" offset="11381530">It's a hot issue, and both sides have extremely strong views on it and the views were presented in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.491" offset="11413295">We think that the place for the presentation of those views is Congress or is the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.978" offset="11439313">The railroads repeatedly say, “State legislature are repealing full-crew laws that shows how old fashion they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.223" offset="11464286">Maybe that's so, and that's where they should be if that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.143" offset="11475989">And we'll argue about that in that forum.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.855" offset="11486751">But this Court in all kinds of battlefield, in due process field, in political questions field, has said, “It's not for Congress to oversee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.450" offset="11529174">It's not for this Court to oversee either Congress or the state legislature about these clashes of fact and opinion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.043" offset="11559581">This is not a matter for the judicial sword.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.679" offset="11570134">It seems to us that the very process of argument is of some value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.822" offset="11594689">That the very process of compromised, the very process of adjusting state power to federal power being that it was considered by Congress, being that it is considered by state legislature are something for those bodies to consider rather than for this Court to consider and it is asking the Court to go beyond what has been its concept of its function in those cases in this particular preemption case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.088" offset="11699702">I like to retain the rest of time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2904.907" offset="11723003">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.827" offset="11746722">In my presentation, I will amplify somewhat the history that's already been given of the Arkansas laws involved in the scope of their coverage, the exceptions they contain and also a -- give a somewhat detail, the history of the dispute which gave rise to the passage of Public Law 88-108 in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.737" offset="11858317">I'll discuss the scope and contents of the awards and demonstrate it by their terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.298" offset="11880573">They are in irreconcilable conflict of the state statutes here involved which also purport to fix the size of train crews.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.255" offset="11916413">And I'll also discuss our contention entirely apart from the preemption issues raised in a position that has gone unanswered here and indeed we think is unanswerable, that these laws amount to an impermissible discrimination against interstate commerce, and in favor of intrastate commerce, as distinguished from the lower frequent undue burden on commerce contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.526" offset="12029471">My colleague Mr. Lyons will develop our position that no alleged safety exception saves these particular laws from the preemption by the federal legislation with which they are in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.451" offset="12097181">He will also discuss the congressional intent of incorporating and integrating Public Law 88-108 into the Railway Labor Act, instead of into the Interstate Commerce Commission procedure as was first proposed by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.228" offset="12156322">He will also develop the congressional intention with respect to the two-year limitation which was contained in Public Law 88-108.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.444" offset="12197177">In 1907 statute, first to the Arkansas statutes here involved, requires a crew of six men spelling them out by position - engineer, fireman, conductor, and a three brakemen on every free train operated in Arkansas that meets the specification of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.735" offset="12274291">The vast majority of the free trains operated by these six plaintiff railroad companies in Arkansas do meet the specifications prescribed by that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.795" offset="12314520">The Act also spells out that its heavy burden will be imposed, “regardless of any modern equipment” that may be placed on those railroad trains and it's spoken that language of modern equipment in the year 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.237" offset="12380348">The Act contains these exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.187" offset="12392155">It does not apply to railroad with less than 50 miles of line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.642" offset="12409919">I will discuss that exemption as it lays the burden of this Act on interstate commerce alone exempting intrastate commerce.</text>
