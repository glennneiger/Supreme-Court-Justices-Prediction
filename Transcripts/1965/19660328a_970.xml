            <label>Mr. Solicitor General Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="12.165" offset="152012">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.066" offset="175626">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.075" offset="207705">I would like to first reverse and give the question and then get to the facts because the two are so combined together, there’s only a single question before the Court, it’s whether or not a Federal Court of Appeals having ultimate review jurisdiction of a Federal Trade Commission merger proceeding may under the All Writs Statute issue an injunction to maintain the status quo pending the outcome of the administrative proceedings where the validity of a merger under Section 7 of the Clayton Act is pointed issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.263" offset="376456">We emphasize that only the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals is involved in this case because that was the ruling of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.156" offset="420028">We do not argue that in the circumstance of this case adaptable principles required the issuance of the injunction for the court below did not reach the merits of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.792" offset="470497">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit dismissed the petition of the Commission on the grounds that was simply without power to entertain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.723" offset="518248">And so the facts be very briefly stated, around December 13 of last year, Dean Foods Company and Bowman Dairy Company agreed that Dean would acquire all of Bowman’s operating assets as of January 3 of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.537" offset="609468">The month prior granting to this agreement, Dean had asked the merger division of the Federal Trade Commission for its informal advice as to the legality of this proposed acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.355" offset="672789">And after an immediate investigation, the merger division of FTC advised Dean that it would recommend that a complaint be issued against this acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.242" offset="724302">Dean and Bowman were substantial competitors in the sale of package milk in Chicago area.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.542" offset="753560">Bowman was the first or second largest seller of packaged milk while Dean was the third or fourth largest seller in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.837" offset="794728">All together, the four largest dairy companies had a combined market in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.254" offset="820433">The share exceeded 40% of that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.862" offset="838823">Since the agreement between Dean and Bowman would eliminate Bowman as a competitor, there was we submit sufficient reason to believe that it would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act in view of the high concentration in the Chicago milk market.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.985" offset="915310">Dean, however, notified the Commission's staff on December 14th, that the purchase agreement between Bowman had been consummated and executed the day before which was December 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.477" offset="973302">And on December 22, the Commission -- the Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint charging that Dean's acquisition of Bowman would substantially lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.885" offset="1046862">Now, Dean had told the Commission staff that shortly after a consummation agreement, it intended to dispose off Bowman's retail delivery milk routes, closed barriers of its plants and consolidate operations of the two companies and so the Commission on December 30 filed a petition in the Seventh Circuit which is the normal within dispute as the Court of Appeals which would have the ultimate jurisdiction to review any action by the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.911" offset="1186983">And in these pleadings, was sought an order under the All Writs Statute enjoining Dean and Bowman from taking any steps to carry out the purchase agreement pending completion of the Commission's adjudication of its complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.735" offset="1262320">And in that, they alleged -- the Commission alleged that if Dean carried out its plans for the disposition of Bowman's assets, it would be virtually impossible to restore Bowman as a viable independent company, should the acquisition finally be adjudged and lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.822" offset="1338702">The Commission wished to preserve the possibility of an effective remedy against this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.217" offset="1376214">On January 4th, the Court of Appeals entered the temporary restraining order and agreement was held up on January of 19th, the Seventh Circuit dismissed the Commission petition for one of jurisdiction and at the same time it dissolve the temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.629" offset="1453850">And three hours later, the purchase agreement was carried out and Dean begun effectuating the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.091" offset="1487705">And on January 24th, Mr. Justice Clark entered the order stating most of the changes in the business in operation of Bowman pending the disposition of this petition for certiorari.</text>

            <label>Mr. Solicitor General Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="367.161" offset="1572028">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.252" offset="1580387">The -- Mrs. Turner was here was the one who represented them in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.825" offset="1602644">And in the Court of Appeals from the very beginning, of course it should be pointed out it was on affidavits and both sides, lawyers appeared and the Commission's lawyers argued under the All Writs Statute and the three judges of the Court of Appeals especially residing judge kept insisting that the Commission had no right to file the suit and had no standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.804" offset="1714552">The lawyer representing Dean insisted that he would go into the merits and constantly told the Court that if the Court granted the restraint -- granted the injunction, the only recourse would be to drop the agreement and everything would fall through.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.938" offset="1783097">And the conclusion of the Court of Appeals which appears here on page 154, set forth clearly that the whole theory was that the Commission had no right to file the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.891" offset="1850911">And indeed in this Court, Dean has insisted that the point is whether or not the Federal Trade Commission has standing to sue rather than to whether or not the All Writs Statute means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.074" offset="1919666">Of course, we recognize that the Department of Justice acting through the anti-trust division could have gone into the District Court but there are two points that we have met at the beginning of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.526" offset="1981524">And I don't think there's legal relevance to it except for the in terrorem effect but Dean went to the Federal Trade Commission to report this merger, they didn't go to the anti-trust division.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.547" offset="2041605">And its understanding that I have is that either the anti-trust or federal trade could have looked at this merger but that because of the large number of milk merger cases that have been considered by the Federal Trade Commission, it's generally understood that the Federal Trade Commission is better equipped to examine into the merger of milk mergers, milk companies, then would be the anti-trust division to the same -- I understand there are others like automobiles etcetera, that anti-trust itself is better equipped to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.143" offset="2223940">The two agencies have coextensive authority in this field but the argument is very interesting on behalf of Dean and Bowman.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.923" offset="2271065">I'm sure that had the anti-trust division moved in the District Court, the argument would be made that the Federal Trade Commission should have moved in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.299" offset="2312547">I don't know just how it would work out.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.404" offset="2321011">But if the department had moved in the District Court, would've been moving under perhaps the Federal Trade Commission or to the United States?</text>

            <text syncTime="573.730" offset="2398333">It would have been its own complaint but I do not -- it's my understanding that the anti-trust division in the Federal Trade Commission keep each other advised of what the other one is doing but if it is an anti-trust matter then the anti-trust division of the Department of Justice handles it in the US attorney or member of the anti-trust division is the man who proceeds and not the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.151" offset="2631973">And we think that Congress in setting up the two fields had in mind that there were some types of actions that a commission independently could handle better than an arm of the Department of Justice where the ultimate decision in the Department of Justice anti-trust case is made by the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.003" offset="2735417">The decision if made by the Commission is made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Court of Appeals comes in only after the Trade Commission makes its ruling so that the expertise is really the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.838" offset="2798738">Now, if the Federal Trade Commission is unable to hold things in the status quo under certain circumstances, then once they decide the case and that there should divestiture, it's possible that you can't divest what you don't have and that is why we sought there was no question but that the Court of Appeals having the ultimate order to sign in this particular case or any other case, most certainly had the right to protect its jurisdiction not the jurisdiction of the Commission, the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission or counsel, but the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.500" offset="4265357">And along that same line it seems to me that I should mention the other point of Dean's argument which is that this will be very harmful to the Courts of Appeals because they aren't setup to hear cases where there's an evidentiary problem involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.036" offset="4355532">Well, the truth of the matter is that they are running about and I thought some unknown reason, I'm familiar with the fact that the Courts of Appeals are little loaded with, they don't want extra work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.814" offset="11206614">The only question is one of the status quo on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.513" offset="11233468">I want to come to second -- and I am going to run whole this very briefly, the question of the Court of Appeals hearing the preliminary injunction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.988" offset="11271293">To my mind, this is a matter of very great significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.987" offset="11295326">In this very case, normally we're allowed 45 minutes on the side to handle this whole case and the Court generously gave us 50 minute during the course of the 50-minute session, during the course of the argument on affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.415" offset="11353004">Now, I've been involved in these hearings in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.027" offset="11363453">They're an entirely different type of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.646" offset="11374007">When you're in a District Court, you have pretrial conference with the judge, the issues are set up, the decision is made as to what extent, you proceed on affidavits and to what extent you stipulate, what extent you proceed on testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.487" offset="11437328">The trend, the trend as reported by the courts, the trend in preliminary injunction hearings today is to have virtually a trial on the merits in the District Courts with hundreds of pages, thousands of pages of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.528" offset="11497514">The reason for it is that very frequently in these cases that preliminary injunctive hearing is a final hearing as it would have been in this very case, had the Court granted a preliminary injunction against this, that would be in the end of this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.285" offset="11552475">The reason is and important reason is that you can't live under a temporary injunction and maintain the status quo for the period of time that takes to try one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.435" offset="11593122">Rail problems, finance problems, customer problems and what a normally if the court stops the merger at the beginning that's the end of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.939" offset="11623111">So that's where the district judge can fairly conscience not grant injunction without a full hearing or to deny injunction to the Department of Justice without a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.354" offset="11664802">And so I say that it would be a very radical departure to subject the Court of Appeals to this kind of a -- to this kind of a proceeding.</text>
