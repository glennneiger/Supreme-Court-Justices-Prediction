            <text syncTime="41.281" offset="268518">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.629" offset="289938">The sole issue in this case is whether or not the petitioner is entitled to the retail establishment exemption, provided in Section 13 (a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.564" offset="365589">The case was tried in the Southern District of Idaho before the Honorable Fred Taylor after a pretrial stipulation with which it was agreed the sole issues of whether or not the petitioner's establishment was considered a retail establishment within the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.603" offset="485752">A second issue was in the stipulation as to whether or not it was a mixed issue of fact and law as to whether or not the petitioner's establishment complied with the so-called retail concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.572" offset="569657">After a two-day of trial in which seven or eight witnesses were introduced, the Court made findings of fact which among other things stated as follows, the defendant is engaged in the City of Burley, a small farming community in the State of Idaho in the making, selling and installing, and repairing of sheet metal products including the sale of Southern Sheet Metal, waterspouts, elbows, and similar items.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.390" offset="720959">And that during the years 1959 and 1960 and 1961, the defendant's products and services were sold concede no processors engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.031" offset="767457">The sale and services for the most part made and rendered intermittently enduring the down seasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.589" offset="801729">That the defendant's business was established with a purpose of serving the City of Burley and the surrounding community making sales and rendering services to a variety of customers predominantly in number of sales to farmers, ranchers, and local individuals and businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.333" offset="876753">All of the defendant's sales of services were in the State of Idaho and on a retail basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.579" offset="905697">The defendant's business is local in its nature, was established for the purpose of serving the Burley area, and it's not closely related to nor directly essential to the production of goods for or in commerce but for the primary purpose of serving local needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.101" offset="979780">That the products sold and services rendered to the processing communities where for the most part similar to items which could be and sometimes are fabricated by the processing companies in their in-plant shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.249" offset="1036413">The products produced by the defendant do not enter the channels of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.133" offset="1059924">The defendant's prices per services and product are computed on the same basis for all customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.038" offset="1087509">Fabricated parts are uniformly priced on the basis of material operating cost and its profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.012" offset="1111437">The defendant's non-fabricated products such as steels, solder, and other items are displayed on racks or shelves and are similar in this respect to what is described a tin shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.614" offset="1165876">The defendant's establishment is recognized as a retail establishment by the defendant and salesmen within the industry and none of the sales made by the defendant were for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.663" offset="1226062">Based on this pretrial stipulation and the evidence in the case, the Court found that the petitioner's establishment was not closely related to or directly essential to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.569" offset="1309654">And I believe the finding was based somewhat on the decision by this Court in Zachry versus Mitchell which the late immanent jurist, Justice Frankfurter in the opinion in which there were three or four dissenters ruled that it was perhaps time that we examined the question of how far the Government should go in regulating or encroaching upon what is in effect a purely local business set up to regulate or set up to serve a local community.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.406" offset="1504946">In Mitchell versus Zachry case, a city had built a dam or impounded water and it developed that the water from this dam was being used by people who were engaged to producing goods for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.958" offset="1579238">There's a very similar and there's a great deal of similarity between the two cases because in that case, this Court held that the purpose of the dam or the purpose of the impounding of the water was to serve the local community and that 50% or more of the sales of this water was to the community and in point of number, I think this is what then goes to the Court somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.198" offset="1688116">In point of number of sales, not the total volume, this establishment had maybe a thousand sales to what the record shows versus six or seven sales to producers who were in the interstate commerce in the point of number.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.958" offset="1771186">The Court also found of course that we were a retail establishment as defined by the 1949 Amendment of the Fair Labor Standard Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.274" offset="1812459">The case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit Court reversed the District Court on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.040" offset="1843493">And we're here now on certiorari on the one question of whether or not we are a retail establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.080" offset="1875675">Unless the Court has some question in mind that I could more or less direct my attention to, I believe that the case before this Court involves two rather serious questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.529" offset="1937533">Number one, the question of whether or not based on the facts which I've proposed to enlarge upon, a fact-finding tribunal or a District Court after hearing all the testimonies and after examining the pretrial stipulation and far as in this case, there was only one witness for the Government which was a professor who had graduated from Washington University and who admitted that he had no experience whatsoever in the retail sheet metal industry or tin shops, and where he admitted that his own experience was with trading stamps and items of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.656" offset="2121958">Whether or not under that record is proper for this Court to brush it aside or for the Ninth Circuit Court to brush it inside and we say, “We pay no attention to those findings of fact”.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.113" offset="2171800">Most of those findings of fact, if the Court please, were undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.225" offset="2192280">There wasn't any question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.504" offset="2201370">The stipulation, the pretrial stipulation, specifically provides that the only issue before that court was whether or not this establishment was considered a retail establishment within the industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.574" offset="2261661">I want to ask if the complicated statute or provisions in the making of potential do you think is the pivotal aspect.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eli_a_weston" startTime="552.499" stopTime="824.124">
            <label>Mr. Eli A. Weston</label>
            <text syncTime="552.499" offset="2313383">I think the pivotable aspect, put it that way, Justice Harlan, I believe that question of whether or not this establishment having been set up to serve a community, it was serving a community with the great -- largest majority of the sales and the small sales to the ultimate consumer and not for resale that that should enjoy or should have the retail establishment exemption under Section 13 (a) (2), if I understand your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.795" offset="2438562">I think we're involved here now in, number one, an interpretation of the 1949 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.568" offset="2469595">Does it mean what it says?</text>
            <text syncTime="594.391" offset="2480985">I frankly am much concerned about the constant use of this term “retail concept”.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.073" offset="2507630">I don't know how you got into my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.764" offset="2514422">I don't know how you got into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.190" offset="2524139">But I do know that that is the thing that the Administrator or the Secretary is now hanging on to for all the other facts indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.118" offset="2559875">It would may even be isolated from the production of commerce or it would may have all of the other qualifications of a retail establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.454" offset="2597177">Now, I think the 1949 Amendment either means exactly what it says, or it doesn't and I think it's time frankly that we give the interpretation that the Congress intended as I read the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.688" offset="2654124">Part of 1949, the Administrator was given the authority to interpret the question of what was or was not paid and what was or what was not a retail establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.584" offset="2705742">And in those interpretative bulletins which were numerous went into the very many facets of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.353" offset="2740746">Did it look like a retail store?</text>
            <text syncTime="661.763" offset="2750464">Did it have shelves?</text>
            <text syncTime="663.641" offset="2757987">Did it have a cash register?</text>
            <text syncTime="665.579" offset="2765720">Did it sell in small items like a box of matches or a bunch of bananas?</text>
            <text syncTime="671.214" offset="2788185">Was it to the ultimate consumer?</text>
            <text syncTime="673.596" offset="2797798">And in his first interpretative bulletins and in his first regulations, he limited the retail establishment to -- almost to the corner stores who have so heavily stated in the Kentucky Finance case.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.800" offset="2870523">The Congress apparently because even in those definitions, he used the business use test and he used the fleet test, all of these various items that the Administrator used to determine what was or was not a retail establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.746" offset="2930395">In my opinion were considered too restrictive because as the Courts -- I believe the congressional record shows one of the senators made the illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.606" offset="2973759">He said, “If I go to a store and buy two towels for my home, that's the retail sale but if a hotel goes and buy as a gross of towels, that's under your interpretation is considered nonretail.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.535" offset="3029556">If I happened to have a store and I buy fleeted cars to deliver my goods you say that's nonretail because of the size.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.506" offset="3061426">If I give one customer a reduction because he buys more than another, you say that's nonretail.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.697" offset="3086190">And I honestly believe that the Congress in the 1949 Amendment said to the Administrator, “Now let's understand, there's only two tests that you're allowed to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.187" offset="3136136">One is, are these sales for a resale?</text>
            <text syncTime="762.162" offset="3152018">And two is, is this considered a retail establishment within the industry?</text>
            <text syncTime="767.684" offset="3174066">Now, that 1949 Amendment was intended in my opinion to permit this Court or any reviewing body to determine whether or not the Administrator had prior to 1949 determined whether the particular establishment in question was nonretail or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.491" offset="3277302">Now, if the Administrator had held as we found in the Kentucky Finance case that this was a nonretail establishment because they determined that financial institutions of that kind dealing in finance were not considered to be a retail establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.153" offset="3359953">Then under the 1949 Amendment, they could not claim to be a retail establishment and that's what was established in my opinion in the retail, in the Kentucky Finance case.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.593" offset="3637791">Now, in this case, actually, I believe we are now in the position of deciding these cases on a case-by-case basis because of the 1949 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.451" offset="3693171">And in this case, there was no determination prior to 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.600" offset="3717726">In this type of an establishment, there was no determination that we were nonretail and there was no determination that we were retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.340" offset="3756701">And the reason for that, if the Court please, is probably because this particular establishment is the evolution for the growing up of the old time tin shop which we found either in the seller or the backroom of the hardware store.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.001" offset="3843427">These establishments feel as the -- one of the witnesses said the hiatus which was left when the manufacturing companies decided to manufacture the tin items that you or I might go in and purchase from the old tin shop in the back of the retail hardware store.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.857" offset="3918764">The manufacturing companies deciding to furnish those items to the hardware store had left the hardware store going one way and the old style of tin shop going the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.779" offset="3958471">Now, the testimony in this case shows that we use the same machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.258" offset="3976443">We do exactly the same thing as we did in the tin shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.953" offset="3991176">We sell these items at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.366" offset="4004864">A man comes into the store and wants his spout.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.640" offset="4013955">The woman may want a sides of the dish pan, a farmer may want a watering trough or I may want -- a store, may want something in the instance of the processing companies which are used here as the interstate users.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.904" offset="4071006">Our cert suggested the Court that those processing companies are not what is generally termed a big manufacturing company, processing companies as the Court will take judicial notice of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.658" offset="4121997">I'll assume at least it's in the record that the processing company came to bury after our establishment was setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.725" offset="4158255">And contrary to what the Government would suggest in the brief, the processing and the freezing of potatoes is not what you might term a substantial type of manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.919" offset="4227009">It's a simple process and the machinery -- and the fabricating materials furnished to these companies were first, number one, furnished during the down period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.803" offset="4274552">Number two, there were items which would consist of guards where the motors are, and ventilators are, and one of these statements made what they called an endless belt which was simply a leather belt with pleats on it which would carry the potatoes along until they are sorted, washed, and cooked, and frozen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.605" offset="4353755">The item -- the articles of the -- the testimony shows that this same company had an establishment in Boise which was a 180 miles from Burley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.580" offset="4405687">And the president of the company testified that in the Boise plant, they did make large equipment from manufacturing plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.173" offset="4440064">And the one item that was referred to here, quite often by the Government in their brief and at that the time of the trial was a vent which was built which is that I believe seven or eight feet long and 23 feet high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.914" offset="4498996">But the testimony shows that that was vent and manufactured at the Boise Plant which was a different type of operation tariff.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.520" offset="5081422">I believe Senator Wherry and I think that Senator Pepper asked the unanimous consent if that the gist of what is a retail concept.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.805" offset="5266578">We're not interested at all of these other tests that you have applied including the retail concept.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.116" offset="5479842">The copies -- the reason I have mentioned, the Zachry case and the reason why I have mentioned this issue which is actually not before the Court is because the Government seems to take into position, if I understand their brief, that where we have an establishment that has been considered or has been determined to be in the production of goods for commerce that it automatically cannot have a retail establishment exemption and I believe Justice Harlan in the Kentucky Finance case or in the Roland Electric case made the statement that it was rare not impossible for the establishment to be engaged in interstate commerce on the production of goods for commerce and at the same time claim the retail establishment exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.832" offset="5694673">And I call attention to the fact that this opinion was written before the 1949 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.778" offset="5722467">It is written before the amendment which required the original law provided that only the establishment had to do was to be necessary to the production of commerce which is a very loose termalmost anything could be necessary for the production of the items for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.445" offset="5789132">But in 1949, they amended the law of the state that it must be closely related to and this is what Justice Frankfurter seems to discuss at length in the Zachry case which says it must be closely related to the production of goods for commerce, and I submit to the Court that in this case, we are related to the services of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.434" offset="5893099">We are related in furnishing the products to individual purchasers in the community, the farmer, the merchants, and the individual housewife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.291" offset="5924551">We were set up for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.990" offset="5935313">Unfortunately, the processing companies came in after we were established and we did furnish them some materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.910" offset="5966973">But I still think it's important that those materials according to the record are furnished when the plants were down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.676" offset="5998111">They were furnished on an emergency basis to a great extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.216" offset="6016188">The services that we rendered to those companies could have been performed by the companies themselves and as one witness said, they are very frequently were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.170" offset="6056103">Now, the question that arises, how closely connected are we to a potato processing company under those circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.676" offset="6098108">We feel that the -- the record shows that we were not closely connected to or directly essential to the operation of those plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.037" offset="6135515">Now, that's what the court below felt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.970" offset="6147218">The court felt we were set up to serve a community and we were not set up to service or to render necessary or essential machinery to a processing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.127" offset="6207927">On the question of whether we are a retail establishment or not, I would like to just briefly go over the evidence of the president of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.547" offset="6249514">And I'll hit it just very briefly, the president of the company stated that he'd been in the tin manu -- the tin processing business for many years, I think 39 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.953" offset="6287235">He testified they have a store license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.384" offset="6296952">He testified that they did the manufacturing in Boise not in Burley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.415" offset="6313044">He testified that the services are rendered as an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.087" offset="6327672">He testified that the same machinery is used in his tin shop, now it was used 39 years ago and in fact one of the same machines preferably is in the present shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.290" offset="6368528">He testified that the number of sales to the individuals were greater than the sales being numbered to the processing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.737" offset="6398307">He testified that they have a stock on the shelves that you could in the place of business to see what you want to buy is right there in displaying on the shelves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.560" offset="6429654">That they were considered retail within the industry and someone asked whether -- the government attorney asked if he had any counters, and he said “Yes, we have six counters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.838" offset="6466748">He said, “If you come in to our establishment and you see something on the place that you want and made in to a particular item, a custom-built item, we have six tables and we have six salesmen and they can tell you or ask you what you want, you can tell them what it was and they'll build it for you and sell it to you at retail.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.028" offset="6531532">He compared it to a woman going into a store and buying a bowl of cloth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.124" offset="6551907">He testified that they were a retail custom shop and under their sales for -- were for retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.821" offset="6582627">And he testified as to the types of customers and I haven't much time where I would read that these customers are variety of farmers and ranchers and housewives and grocery stores and other stores.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.909" offset="6859003">Mr. Coffin is the secretary and the attorney for the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.728" offset="6882304">He's a retired attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.325" offset="6892648">But he very vividly pointed out why he considered this retail establishment and he suggested even he was a boy of 13 that his father had a hardware store and that he very often visited the tin shop because he was intrigued by the way the tin shop operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.271" offset="6968508">And this witness who again had been familiar with the industry for 35 or 40 years testified that the establishment in question here was simply the evolution or the filling in of the gap between the old time tin shop and the present custom metal shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.212" offset="7068191">In other words, he testified that the customers were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.790" offset="7082506">The articles that were molded and made were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.960" offset="7107166">And the only difference was that there were larger customers and they were using perhaps a different metal than they did in the old tin shop days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.767" offset="7142484">And he also testified that there's no place else, if the Court please, and I think this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.414" offset="7165053">There was no place else where an individual customer could go and get this particular item except of this type of an establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.802" offset="7206536">Now, the testimony was a reference to other, we were considered a retail establishment and then the industry was furnished to us by salesmen, both wholesale salesmen and manufacturing salesmen who testified without contradiction that we are at the end of the line, that we were considered the retailer in the industry, that all of the others up from us were considered wholesalers or manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.151" offset="7315937">The testimony of the professor was very interesting but on cross-examination, the -- practically every point made by the professor could be eliminated by the 1949 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.825" offset="7394722">For example, he stressed the size of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.055" offset="7407574">He stressed the price of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.405" offset="7420949">I think he stressed the fact that it was the -- it went back to the old business use test which in our opinion was definitely eliminated by the 1949 Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.368" offset="7528887">I believe in this case that my brother here is apparently asking this Court to reverse itself in the position which he took in the Kentucky Finance case, opinion written by Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.830" offset="7598686">To the effect that there exists in the statute what has become in familiar terms to be known as a retail concept and I would like further to say at the outset that the issue here is limited to the proper interpretation and application of the retail and service to establishment exemption at it is contained in 13 (a) (2) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.247" offset="7740374">The issue before this Court is not whether or not the activities of the petitioner in this case are essential to production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.746" offset="7790320">That question was laid at rest by the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.702" offset="7810173">Certiorari was limited in this case to the question of whether or not the petitioner was within the retail exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.688" offset="7842147">I wish to emphasize that because it has already been found and determined by the Court of Appeals and is not questioned here that this petitioner was engaged in activities necessary to production for interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.257" offset="7908394">Now, I think that Mr. Justice Harlan asked a pivotal question here, rather, he said, what is the pivotal aspect of the retail and the service establishment exemption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.024" offset="7975476">And I think the pivotal aspect of it is that we are not here in this case, none of the facts, which I will briefly explain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2031.484" offset="8229282">These two cases combined, stands squarely for the proposition that sales and services of the Idaho Sheet Metal Works in this case are predominantly and clearly outside what is known as the retail concept actually first having its formation in the Roland Electric case in 1946 and strongly reaffirmed by this Court in the Kentucky Finance case to such an extent that the sales and services and the establishment in question cannot in any sense be considered as within the retail and service establishment exemption of 13 (a) (2) of the Fair Labor Standards Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.018" offset="8427395">Now, involved here, we have a sheet metal firm, and not just a tin shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.469" offset="8457279">We cannot look at this as it was at the turn of the century or is it maybe even at this moment we have to look at what this firm as shown by the record to be, one the Court of Appeals found it to be during the years 1959 to 1961 which are the years involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.269" offset="8544423">During that three-year period, we have affirmed which the Court of Appeals found as manufacturing, installing, maintaining, and repairing sheet metal equipment for five large potato processors producing goods for interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.591" offset="8617775">83% of the defendant's gross income was derived from these customers and I think the total amount was something in excess of a total valid volume of $500,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.740" offset="9946363">The holding in the Roland Electric case as distinguished from the dicta which I was just questioned about by Mr. Justice Stewart was that where affirms are doing precisely that namely; they're doing work which is necessary to production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.374" offset="10016893">Then in this case, in the Roland case, it happened to be repairing, fixing, and furnishing electric generators and motors to many different customers who in turn were producing and manufacturing for interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.414" offset="10081050">And the Court said that the keywords that the Court used here are that the Act does not exempt this retail and I quote, "The multitude of employees were engaged in establishments which supply the materials and services currently needed for the maintenance of productive machinery used by those who produced goods for interstate commerce."</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.138" offset="10183973">Now, the Court added to that that these employees are in the middle of the flow of goods in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.788" offset="10230575">It commented that it would take the heart out of the Act, to fail to reach these employees engaged in these activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.292" offset="10260564">And they concluded that the exemption reaches employees only of such retail or service establishments as a comparable to the local merchants of the opponent grocer or the filling station operator who sells their services ultimate to consumers and work of that sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.668" offset="10326079">Now, this case, this Roland Electric case, is very much alive today and the principal reason why I believe it is alive is the Kentucky Finance case which in effect affirmed the existence of his retail concept that Roland in substance established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.462" offset="10429210">Now, in Kentucky Finance, this Court was considering the continuing vitality of this traditional retail concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.652" offset="10473932">After, mind you, after the 1949 Amendments had added the so-called industry recognition test to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.361" offset="10520848">And the Court correctly emphasized again that the sole purpose of Congress in amending of the statute was to overrule the so-called business use test that is any sales for business use is a nonretail sale which was generally approved in dicta in the Roland case and as to which this Court said, “We find nothing in the debates or the reports which suggest that Congress intended by the amendment to broaden the fields of business enterprise to which the exemption would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.287" offset="10688554">And thus, at the very least where Congress ruled the Senate and House reports explicitly stated that certain business activities were not exempted by the 1949 Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.082" offset="10739649">Such businesses are clearly outside the retail concept regardless of what the industry thinks or says or recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.879" offset="10782908">Now, Kentucky Finance was dealing with credit companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.758" offset="10802448">And these were found by Congress to be expressly excluded from any continuing retail concept.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.607" offset="11253844">We have sales and servicing of manufactured equipment used in the production of goods and that therefore this case is governed by the combination of Kentucky Finance and for Roland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.232" offset="11316328">Now, there are two cases which have been decided by my brother which I'd like to refer to briefly before concluding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.557" offset="11349556">The first is the Modern Trashmoval case decided in the Fourth Circuit a couple of years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.816" offset="11382680">Now, in this case, the Fourth Circuit held among other things that trash removal services were not outside the traditional retail concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.362" offset="11432835">Now, in so doing, the Court referred to the Kentucky Finance decision and recognized as held in that case that there are fields which completely lack a retail concept such as finance and there are business activities which had been specifically mentioned by Congress as being ineligible where an exemption for a retail of service establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.374" offset="11524890">The Court noted that trash removal held in either one of these categories and ultimately decided that it was within the retail concept and the retail activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.307" offset="11572642">The truck contrast of course with this case is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.431" offset="11589047">Now, here in this case, the business activity of Idaho Sheet Metal Works fell precisely within those specifically mentioned by Congress as being ineligible for exemption as retail or service establishments.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Donahue</label>
            <text syncTime="2914.174" offset="11760097">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.284" offset="11772531">I would like to -- perhaps as my concluding remarks simply by further reference to the question I think Mr. Justice Stewart asked concerning their being involved in Kentucky Finance, a credit company which fell in a list of those companies outside the retail concept as expressly stated by the Congress and in re-referring myself to that case, I reassure myself that the court in that case, and I quote said, and repeat from four, "We find nothing in the debates or reports which suggest that Congress intended by the amendment to broaden the fields of business enterprise to which the exemption would apply, meaning that if it applied before 1949 as expressly so determined at that time or if it fell in a class that was -- of a type which was mentioned before 1949, then it was of the kind not necessarily of the exact type mentioned but of the kind which the Congress and the Administrator intended to continue to be entitled to or ineligible for the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.332" offset="12112750">To emphasize that point, I wish to also to indicate that the Court in that case merely referred to the expressed mentioning by Congress of credit companies to remove what it called any residual doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.467" offset="12181191">It was expressly mentioned, therefore doubly, it was outside the retail exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.932" offset="12207104">Another point, in order to remove any residual doubt in my case, so far as the Roland Electric Company is concerned, I would like to call the Court's attention to a colloquy of questions and answers put by Senator Spessard Holland in Florida, who was the sponsor of this retail amendment in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.331" offset="12312743">The question is, and I quote from it, from the record, "In Roland Electric Company versus Walling, the Supreme Court held that a company engaged in selling industrial goods and services to manufacturers engaged in the production of goods for interstate commerce and to other industrial and business customers were not a retail service establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.519" offset="12409396">Would that case be decided any differently under the proposed amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="3091.776" offset="12470523">It's the answer to his own question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.373" offset="12480867">His answer is, "Definitely not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.205" offset="12492152">The sale and servicing of manufacturing machinery and manufacturing equipment used in the production of goods is not regarded as retail servicing or selling in the industry which distributes self services that type of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.746" offset="12558399">Now, turning to the case which I was about to discuss ever so briefly before we recess for lunch, it is Wirtz versus the English Oil Service decided in April of this past year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.184" offset="12632064">The Court as attention is called to this case by the petitioner apparently to be relied upon in support of his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.727" offset="12678248">But far from supporting his position, the Court ruled quite the opposite and held that an enterprise whose primary business is the holding away and disposing in saltwater and basic sediment from producing oil wells services closely related and directly essential to production for interstate commerce could not qualify for the retail and service exemption even though such services are considered retail within the oil industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.318" offset="12816593">It is interesting to note that this case distinguished Modern Trashmoval because the Fourth Circuit answered the initial inquiry which the Court said was important here as to the retail concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.973" offset="12875316">In the affirmative, in the case at bar as in the English Oil Company, plainly, the initial inquiry must be answered in the negative here as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.889" offset="12930905">Now, since over 80% of the petitioner's gross annual income is derived from sales and services probably outside the statutory retail and service establishment concept, we submit, that the petitioner cannot qualify for this exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.000" offset="13251375">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.448" offset="13269138">This case also presents the question of the application of the retail and service establishment exemption of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.293" offset="13304560">And it raises the question with respect to a business of a tire dealer and retailer, a large tire dealer and retailer engaged very substantially in selling and servicing tires to commercial trucking companies, construction contractors and other industrial companies operating fleets of trucks or commercial vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.901" offset="13427022">It admitted that over -- over half of the daily volume of business of the Roland -- of the Steepleton Company is derived from the servicing -- selling and servicing of tires or commercial customers of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.665" offset="13506017">This type -- this business, of course, differs from the one in the Idaho Sheet Metal Company in the sense that this business was not expressly and specifically by name mentioned in the legislative reports and debates and it wasn't expressly stated like it was as to street credit companies and the servicing manufacturing equipment that those activities would remain outside of the scope of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.434" offset="13649063">But our position is that the same principles must necessarily apply in determining what is recognized in a particular industry as retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.042" offset="13699532">That otherwise that phrase in the 1949 Amendments becomes meaningless as we think is very well demonstrated by the record in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.912" offset="13746970">Now, the Court of Appeals below recognized and stated that this business, Steepleton's business, would not be exempt prior to the 1949 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.580" offset="13813739">The Court put it on the basis that across these commercial sales were for business use and that would have disqualified it from the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.328" offset="13864730">The Court then went on to say that the repudiation of the business use test changed that and changed that in such a way that now, any and all sales, any and all sales, to commercial users could now qualify as retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.436" offset="13945083">Our position is particularly on basis of the evidence in this case that if any in all commercial sales can be classified as retail simply by reference to word usage in the industry then the clause recognized in the particular industry as retail is wholly meaningless and self-defeating because any -- any industry can adopt the same type of definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.547" offset="14061589">If the Court will look at the definition in relation to the statutory language, you will see that the definition, “all sales not to resale are retail” which is the definition which was held attended to the exemption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.259" offset="14128358">It was in effect putting a period after being phrase, the first phrase in that clause "not for resale" and just eliminating the industry recognition language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.448" offset="14181125">Now, this sweeping definition, of course, is very simple and easy for any not too unsophisticated businessman to adopt and they could bring in the same type of the evidence that they brought in here to prove that this was traditionally a -- used as a definition of retail in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.173" offset="14280077">Now, the -- in effect then, the court below held that the industry's word usage evidence, a mere showing of the industries word usage that everything not for resale is retail is sufficient to meet the condition of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.808" offset="14354578">That that's purely a factual question the Court has only to inquire what is the definition in the industry and there are no standards, no concepts and no legal question to determine at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.289" offset="14416541">It affirmed the District Court on the grounds that there was substantial evidence to support its findings of fact that the industry recognized this definition of retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.013" offset="14471398">Now, I think it will help some to see what the industry included in this definition.Alright --</text>

            <text syncTime="3611.035" offset="14547466">That's what I hope to direct myself to, primarily, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.115" offset="14571813">But I think to understand -- to get the legal principles and prospective, I think we should look at some of the sales which the industry representatives, witnesses testified were retail sales in their book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.456" offset="14645164">Now, they -- there's a big record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.059" offset="14655613">I don't think there's too much except certainly by the industry representatives, the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.946" offset="14687169">It's a cumulative repetition that regardless of any other consideration or factor, they had always used the word retail to mean sales not for resale and in the -- they didn't give -- they were reluctant to state what purposes they use that definition for but as I shall point out later, the only explanation they gave was that was the state sales tax definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.715" offset="14786226">And as I shall point out later that state sales tax definition clearly has no fresh, no relationship or relevance to any statutory purpose of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.818" offset="14842650">Now, the -- after adopting this -- of course, it is the broadest conceivable definition they could adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.482" offset="14877341">And the witness, Marsh, who was the Executive Director of the Tire Dealers Association testified at length not only about what he regarded as retail sales but also testified at length to show that the industry did make a definite distinction between ordinary retail passenger car sales and commercial sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.745" offset="14982353">And that they have a generally recognized system of discounts of the commercial sales that were quite different from those passenger car sales, that they had different commercial salesmen and they handled these sales in quite different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.771" offset="15046405">They had sales -- special commercial salesman who went out and solicited the business from the common carriers and the big construction companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.993" offset="15075349">They sent special workmen out to work at the terminals of these transportation companies who were their big customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.898" offset="15114951">And they had people continuously servicing, and repairing, and maintaining their tires for continuous operation of their trucks and vehicles in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.257" offset="15168449">But all of these, though that the industry witnesses said, was wholly irrelevant to their definition of retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.357" offset="15204812">The witness Marsh testified that the sales of tires specially fitted for use on heavy commercial equipment even if sold in quantities of a thousand unit lots at a 30% discount off the commercial pricelist would be as much a retail sale as sale of four-passenger car tires to an individual at the least price without a discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.754" offset="15318392">And the same witness testified that the purchasers stopped of a whole stock of earth moving tires for heavy construction equipment for use on a big contracting job would be a retail sale or the sale of $25,000 at a time to a common carrier fleet operator would be a retail sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.888" offset="15406895">Another industry trade association official testified that not only that quantity sales at 50 to a 100 are more of a commercial -- to commercial fleet operators for retail sales but that the sale of specialized three trailer jet airplane tires to commercial airlines was a retail sale in his book notwithstanding his description that this business was highly specialized big business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.940" offset="15519117">Respondent Steepleton himself testified that the sale that as many of -- 50 to a 100 of the largest size truck tire designed to hold anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 pounds payload and used only on the over the -- over the road truck to trailer transports to a customer like Garden Transport, another common carrier of, one of the largest customers Southwestern Transportation Company that that sale was also a resale -- retail in his book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.372" offset="15656835">Now, the basis on which the explanation or the purpose for such a classification, the witnesses insisted was wholly irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.855" offset="15722768">It came out though in their cross-examination and came out very clearly that the only purpose, the only explanation for any such definition as this -- was that they have to pay the state sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.142" offset="15779924">And that naturally they kept records designating sales that they have to pay the sales tax on as consumer or retail sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.637" offset="15821928">And some of the witnesses testified they didn't use the word retail, they used the word consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.431" offset="15845125">The five witnesses said that they hadn't used the word retail to describe any sizeable commercial sale in ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.453" offset="15885145">Marsh when he explained why he would classify earthmover tires, a sale of -- a lot of earthmover tires as retail said, “Well, if that sale occurred in Ohio, he would have to pay sales tax on it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.898" offset="15947003">And Steepleton himself said that this definition -- this definition which he said the industry recognized was exactly like the one in the Tennessee State sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.373" offset="16016906">The point I'm making is if the state sales tax or if the industry is simply saying that they adopt, they follow the state sales tax definition of retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.706" offset="16062151">If that is to be determinative of the application of this condition of the exemption, then we just as well read the exemption of how the Act is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.765" offset="16106454">In the first place, the state -- the state sales tax has no relation to any particular industry so that it's really contrary to the -- it's directly contrary to even the language, the statutory language to say that the state sales tax definition is the one to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.037" offset="16183568">That's a general state definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.187" offset="16196106">It is certainly not a definition of any particular industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.885" offset="16214915">It's general for every industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.720" offset="16222229">And presumably, I feel quite sure that every industry keeps the type of records which these witnesses in this case, the industry witnesses produced in abundance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.536" offset="16277504">We have a mass of exhibits on file here in the Court, a mass of documents which I don't think the Court needs to read and I don't think we find very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4056.424" offset="16329017">But what they are since the whole mass of documents is just a document showing that they classified the sales as consumer, a dealer, a retail sales, and for all and it's pretty clearly from these documents that this was done solely for sales tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.667" offset="16414072">Now, that type of document could be produced in any industry, I assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.907" offset="16431000">I assume some kind of record is kept in the payment of state sales taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.692" offset="16458167">So I think we can count on, and as a matter of fact, as a practical matter, this definition has become very popular generally in most every industry that we bring an action against now that claims the exemption comes in with the same definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.046" offset="16547506">Now, we say that to read the statute is permitting that thought of word usage and just turning merely on word usage without any legal standards or any concepts to read the statute that way as to deprive it of any rational content and to make it depend solely on the will of the industry representatives themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.179" offset="16664116">Nothing was more vehemently denied in the debates of the sponsors then that this was the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.627" offset="16705912">Senator Holland repeatedly disavowed any such intent to permit the industry members themselves to determine what should be regarded as retail sales, the purposes of the exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="4302.266" offset="17312475">We have felt that the fact that this -- the only explanation for this definition was that the state sales tax though is conclusive evidence that this is a wholly meaningless definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.218" offset="17376214">Of course any acceptance of mere word usage, we think, would be irrational in this context but we think it's particularly well demonstrated here by the fact that they resorted to the word ‘usage' in the state sales tax which has absolutely no relevance or meaning in the context of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.928" offset="17467120">Now, we say and to get any rational meaning or to give a rational meaning to this clause of exemption and we realized it's a troublesome clause and understand that on the face of it, it does appear to simply leave it to the recognition of particular industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4364.994" offset="17563355">We think it's clear though that the recognition need not to be interpreted as definition of word ‘usage' that recognition in the particular industry has to be judged in the light of the legislative intent just as every other phrase in the statute must be judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.347" offset="17640782">And that there is ample evidence in the legislative debates and reports to support a rational interpretation which would provide some legal standards in determining which, if any, of these commercial sales are recognized as retail, are treated as a retail or of such a nature as to be eligible to be recognize as retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.626" offset="17749870">And we think that in the Kentucky Finance case, this Court limited the very -- carefully pointed out the limited effect of the 1949 Amendment that it was to eliminate the business use tests in the sense that that was the sole criterion that was -- that the Congress thought have been previously used, that sales had been held not retail solely on the basis that they were for business use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.962" offset="17903261">Now, I think Congress made it perfectly clear that they didn't intend to eliminate -- to eliminate all business use sales from classification as the nonretail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.910" offset="17970970">The specific examples it gave make it quite clear that it did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.781" offset="17990510">And that in these two areas that are applicable to this case, in at least two areas are applicable to this case, Congress intended the Court to make a -- to reach a legal conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.195" offset="18048188">The first area, we think, is the area that the first inquiry is the initial inquiry, the same inquiry which Kentucky Finance recognized must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.958" offset="18103254">And that is whether the particular sales, whether the sale or earthmover tires to construction company to -- for a bigger improvement contract whether can be eligible can ever be recognized as a retail sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="4540.636" offset="18265945">And then the second area, an inquiry, is assuming that you have the type of tires and we admit that some business -- some business sales Congress apparently did want to leave open for a recognition as retail and we say those sales are limited to sales which are comparable to the type of sales previously -- commonly understood as retail and the sales that are treated like retail sales not to sales that are simply called retail sales regardless of how their functional aspects --</text>

            <text syncTime="4670.476" offset="18785259">Let's suppose that a tire company sold one tire to a factory engaged in production for interstate commerce, is it your theory that that tire could not be included in the definition of retail sales either for purposes of computing the 75% or for purposes of determining whether this is a retail establishment?</text>

            <text syncTime="4711.975" offset="18951293">Because it is so -- it is so likely a retail sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.398" offset="18968952">But where it's obviously designed for the purpose of supplying the materials to produce goods, I think it's the difference between that incidentally they purchased along with everybody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="4766.753" offset="19170408">And that is the laundry exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.445" offset="19181171">I think that actually it does support our position which expressly states that sales to transportation communications and some other interest in manufacturing business sales shall not be considered retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.459" offset="19261210">It expressly excludes them in the laundry exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.764" offset="19274480">Now, we have a discussion of that exemption in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.765" offset="19290467">And our opponents argued that that Congress would have put that in 13 (a) (2) if they didn't intend there because they knew how to say it, it's that within 13 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.514" offset="19333413">Our position is that that laundry exemption pretty much came in as an addendum and also that Senator Holland made it very clear that he thought he was doing no more there for laundry as he was giving them the same relief from Roland than everybody else, that all of the other retailers were getting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.444" offset="19413138">And he made this quite clear that that's all he was doing, giving the laundries, putting them in the same position as the other retailers would be in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.019" offset="19443440">So I think the intent is implicit there.</text>

            <text syncTime="5045.893" offset="20286986">I believe that the problem that is brought before the Court by the issuance of its writ is not as broad as the Court might gather from the argument of my friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.883" offset="20338918">It seems to me that the problem before the Court is composed of two ingredients; one being no more than 12 words of the statute, and the other, a conclusion of fact made by the District Court that could cut in by the unanimous circuit of the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.112" offset="20419793">The 12 words of the statute are these, and I will read it and the Court will perceive that the statute contains no words of art, it contains nothing that is obscure, it contains nothing that requires anything except reading, “is not for resale and it is recognized as retail sales or services in the particular industry”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.071" offset="20535672">That is what the Congress said that to me is clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="5158.545" offset="20737546">I don't have to argue that because my friend here in a very able brief on page 20 concedes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.424" offset="20769102">We do not dispute the finding that the word ‘retail' has been used in the industry most often to label all sales not for retail.</text>

            <text syncTime="5188.521" offset="20857501">Now, it probably would be the better part of advocacy for me to sit down now and go out and get a proper lunch and then go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.955" offset="20891146">But I'm not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.374" offset="20896893">I'm going to follow my friend through this rather tedious maze of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.868" offset="20922807">And I do it constant that I am not distracting the Court from the virtues of a solid point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.085" offset="20951751">And I know that the conclusion which I'm going to reach sustains the position that I take.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.079" offset="20975679">This all started back in 1949 on August 30th when Senator Holland introduced his amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.092" offset="21023744">It's quite an interesting speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.093" offset="21031790">It has a good deal to do with Mr. Justice Black, then Senator Black's remarks when the original bill was introduced in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.399" offset="21068988">This is what Senator Holland said that they were trying to accomplish by the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.409" offset="21096991">Mr. President that that arose because the Administrator in the courts including the United States Supreme Court rule that the sales of goods and service for business use is distinguished from family or household use was not retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.252" offset="21152371">I cite at several cases and I should read into the record at this time though I do not propose to worry in the Senate by quoting the same, Roland Electric Company, Boutell against Walling and McComb against Diebert.</text>
            <text syncTime="5276.514" offset="21209422">And then he puts out -- sets out examples of what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.584" offset="21221752">These rulings on a few decisions which have been based upon them together with the most strained rulings had resulted from these decisions have brought about the present situation which I think compels the Congress to pass clarifying legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.177" offset="21280057">Now, what did they intend to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.298" offset="21288521">The area is one sentence in the conference report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.850" offset="21306807">Under this test, any sale or service regardless of the type of customer will have to be treated by the Administrator and courts as a retail sale or service so long as such sale or service is recognized in the particular industry as a retail sale or service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.070" offset="21395623">Well now, where do we get this cloudiness that comes from my adversary's brief?</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.981" offset="21419342">She brings it in commencing on -- in her brief at the bottom of page 33 in which she quotes from a report that was brought in to the congressional record by Senator Pepper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.153" offset="21479946">I will go into that for a minute not because I think it's important but because she lays great stress on it and it is somewhat more interesting that many questions of this type are.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.013" offset="21531460">Senator Pepper sought unanimous consent to put it in to the record and they let him put it in the record, they granted him unanimous consent because Senator Pepper had stated that it had been concurred in by all the conferees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.692" offset="21598124">Then somebody got the idea that Senator Pepper was not as careful with his facts as he should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.004" offset="21623411">So they began to query among the floor of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.857" offset="21638771">He then was able to remember that Mr. Shroyer who was Mr. Taft's representative had not concurred in it and that the other senator, I believe, Mr. Donnell, had not concurred in it whereupon Mr. Wherry rose and said, “Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that that part of the action which the Senate took in granting unanimous consent to the senator from Florida to instate the statement in the record along with the conference report be rescinded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.442" offset="21753187">So that the senators may be given ample time to study the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.091" offset="21767711">Overnight is sufficient time for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.742" offset="21778369">Then, if the Senator will renew his request after members of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, they have had an opportunity to examine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.492" offset="21809298">I think there will be no problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.390" offset="21816926">Mr. Pepper very well just rescinded.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.850" offset="21826748">Then Senator Pepper comes in again with the statement that my friend see -- sets up as the touchstone of the argument about this retail concept in re-establishing Roland and he now comes back, Senator Pepper, “Now, I read often the state not on behalf of all of the conferees because two of the conferees would speak for themselves if they care to do so or through their representatives and through their chosen spokesman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.885" offset="21938866">Let it be clearly understood that the statement only expresses the views of the named three senators as to what the meaning of the language adopted by it and by the Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.880" offset="21978885">I say that it's not only because the record contains no statement on behalf of the Senate conferees whereas the House conferees submitted a rather lengthy statement on the part of the House members.</text>
            <text syncTime="5479.697" offset="22022144">And now here's the way it got in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5482.952" offset="22035205">Mr. Wherry rose -- Mr. Pepper sought to interrupt him, “Mr. Wherry, just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.438" offset="22065089">I have not finished, let me conclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="5493.313" offset="22076583">I do not want to grant unanimous consent if the statement is offered by any other purpose on the part of the Senate conferees, or with the idea that it is to be a guide for those who may later interpret the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.046" offset="22131545">If it is offered on the basis of being merely a statement by individual senators, I shall not object.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.153" offset="22159966">And that's how it got in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.674" offset="22170102">Senator Taft's comment, “I won't worry the Court with it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5671.937" offset="22791084">So, if Your Honors please, there is no legislative pieces for that even if the statute was ambiguous which is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.641" offset="22849912">Now, I come to part of the argument which he makes to which I have a somewhat visual reaction and this she refers to, I say, she, my friendly solicitor and this -- she had written an expert brief and made a good argument and I've heard this argument two courts before so I'm not unfair for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.444" offset="22945102">But she characterized, is this out of Lewis—Carol page 21 of the brief, businessmen are no less entitled in humpty dumpty to make words mean what they want them to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.618" offset="22993795">And if the statute was intended to turn solely on word usage, there's no reason why they should not take advantage of it and adopt whatever usage entitles them to profit benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.056" offset="23035591">And if that is so, the statute is reduced to the absurdity of saying that every industry selling goods not for resale shall pay minimum wages, but if not, would only if the industry is willing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.507" offset="23093373">Now, Judge White answered that by saying, “these habits and practices in the tire industry were not of recent origin nor were they adopted to avoid the provisions of the Act but what traditional and had existed for many years before the amendment was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5769.513" offset="23181458">The same concept of retail in this industry was adopted by the industry and it's shown by the record back in the early 30s at which time under the authority of the Congress the NRA Code was drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.849" offset="23246764">And that definition continued until this Court shut on the Blue Eagle in the Schechter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.515" offset="23277484">Then the same definition was adopted in the industry and was in the OPA Code, continued in the OPA Code as long as the OPA was alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.482" offset="23329311">And it is the concept adopted not only in the State of Tennessee but if my memory is correct in 33 others states that all the plan of retail just exactly the way it has been defined in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.284" offset="23392528">So there is not the slightest basis in this record, not one word that indicates that this definition was adopted for the purposes of this litigation or any litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.042" offset="23443519">But the plain -- the inference is that the people who pass this legislation knew what had been the traditional accepted concept of retail in the industry at the time the legislation was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="6430.871" offset="25826826">We described in our brief the testimony of one of the industry representatives which shows that -- which was to the effect that large tire dealers such as Steepleton do maintain separate divisions for what they call retail, the separate division of wholesale in which they classified sales not for resale and a third division which they classified as a commercial division.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.082" offset="25939675">And Steepleton himself testified as to the divisions in his own plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="6627.612" offset="26613844">I would say this certainly has been our position that the retail concept, the traditional statutory retail concept should be applied in determining whether sales transactions are -- can be recognized as retail are eligible as much so as determining whether a whole business.</text>

            <text syncTime="6653.533" offset="26717497">Suppose Kentucky Finance Company had opened an appliance shop and run it along with its long business, it certainly would not have made the lending of the loan business eligible for the recognition as retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6671.174" offset="26788028">And we think that's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6672.726" offset="26794297">There's a small amount of retail business going along here with a great big amount of business that is -- that we say is not eligible.</text>

            <text syncTime="6697.496" offset="26893354">We did put on and investigated to show that at least more than 25% of it was in this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="6704.769" offset="26922402">But he had pretty incomplete information and we got -- we got no evidence from the respondents, from the defendant, to help us to determine how much of this was of that ineligible type.</text>
            <text syncTime="6721.742" offset="26990320">We know that we have enough that was at the quantity discount to fleet account sales, to bring it well over 25%.</text>
