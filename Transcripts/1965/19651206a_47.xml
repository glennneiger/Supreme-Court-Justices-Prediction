            <label>Mr. Peter Hearn</label>
            <text syncTime="191.942" offset="871111">The particular statute was enacted in 1860.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.574" offset="885635">However, its predecessor was -- which was exactly the same in statutory language was enacted in 1804.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.466" offset="929207">Therefore, on its face, the statute provides no standard which restricts in any manner the uncontrolled and arbitrary discretion of the jury in its practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.019" offset="991483">Furthermore, the decisions have not removed this unconstitutional vagueness and I submit that the jury charge in this particular case was typical of jury charges in Pennsylvania and was in-line with the Pennsylvania authorities which attempted to construe this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.994" offset="1079359">In this case, the jury was charged where defendant is found not guilty of a misdemeanor, but the jury finds that he is been guilty of some misconduct less than the offense which is charged, but nevertheless, misconduct of some kind as a result of which, he should be required to pay some penalty short of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.423" offset="1181027">The costs of prosecution may be placed upon him if his misconduct has given rise to the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.884" offset="1214882">This charge stems primarily from an 1818 Pennsylvania decision which construes the act of 1804 which as I stated to Mr. Justice Brennan was the exact predecessor of the interns of statutory wording of the act which is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.565" offset="1297638">In that case, the court construed the statute and the situations in which it would be imposed as saying that costs would be imposed upon a defendant whose conduct may have been reprehensible or whose innocence may have been doubtful and the costs are imposed for impropriety of conduct or grounds of suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.243" offset="1412368">The result therefore is that not only did -- does the act not have a standard on its face but as construed, it is unconstitutionality vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.792" offset="1458552">There is no standard to guide the jury in its deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.131" offset="1475897">Furthermore, a trial court in attempting to ascertain whether the jury abused its discretion has no standard to guide it.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.334" offset="2392691">However in that case, they were placed upon the county, but I think this shows that the practice is that even though the case on the misdemeanor is not sufficient to take it to the jury, still the costs issue does go.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.476" offset="4001311">And under Pennsylvania practice, if the defendant seeking to rebut against costs offered evidence of good character, the prosecution could come back with the -- a record of prior convictions which it would not be otherwise able to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.624" offset="4069857">So that the -- the defendant is forced to elect, and if he elects to defend against costs, he prejudices his defense on the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.027" offset="4119489">Accordingly, I respectfully request that this Court reverse the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and hold that the Act is unconstitutional insofar as if it -- as it is applied to acquitted the defendants.</text>
