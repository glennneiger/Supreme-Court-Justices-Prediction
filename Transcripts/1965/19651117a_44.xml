            <text syncTime="28.698" offset="218154">The facts are that one Gerald Segal and his father, Sam Segal, are engaged in a business in Dallas, Texas, known as Segal Cotton Products.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.536" offset="257546">A petition of bankruptcy was filed by both father and son and also as a partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.893" offset="282937">As a result of this bankruptcy, they received a discharge and that was in September of 1961 when the petition was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.560" offset="317628">In 1962, the auditor of the Segal Cotton Products filed an application for loss-carryback for refunds.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry Klepak</label>
            <text syncTime="104.699" offset="522219">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.253" offset="528384">Now in -- at that point then, we then -- and in dispute, the referee in bankruptcy held that the funds belong to the trustee in bankruptcy as part of the -- the estate of the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.286" offset="592541">The District Court upheld a certificate of findings of the referee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.574" offset="621693">It was then filled of course to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and that's when trouble started because at that time, I was armed with two Circuit Courts of Appeals decisions both favorable to my clients, one of the First Circuit and the other, the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.159" offset="692015">In both of those decisions, they held that this tax refund was windfall to the taxpayer, to the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.730" offset="730258">And there were the funds of the bankrupt and not to the estate that is to the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.284" offset="752515">And it became a very, very unpopular decision because every magazine and more especially the National Association of Referees in Bankruptcy journal, a number of law reviews such as Texas University, Stanford, Miami University and other law reviews all wrote rather harsh articles against both the First Circuit and the Third Circuit for their findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.524" offset="869439">The First and Third Circuit simply held that the statute as written did not give or place a property right in the bankrupt at its time of bankruptcy whereby, he could, under the term of the statute, transfer that so-called property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.278" offset="940492">He didn't have one.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.186" offset="948120">Also, they brought out the fact that the provisions of the Code provide further that you could not assign a claim against the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.196" offset="992110">We bring to this Court's special attention the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.486" offset="1005275">First I do want to bring the Court's attention this least, that Section 17 which is in controversy -- controversy here which is known 70a (5) of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.853" offset="1054804">This Act was passed in 1898.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.645" offset="1078000">In 1942 is when they first brought the three-year loss-carryback to five-year forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.670" offset="1118020">And that period of time elapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.833" offset="1126693">The language that it uses and in the hearing of the language, and this is under the Bankruptcy Act in which the whole issue evolves itself -- a) the trustee of the estate of the bankrupt shall in turn be vested by operation of law where the title of the bankrupt as the date of filing a petition initiating a proceeding on this title to all of the following kinds of property whatsoever located, here we mean the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.847" offset="1250722">The property including rights of action which prior to the filing of a petition, he could by any means have transferred or which might have been levied upon and sold under judicial process against him, or otherwise seized, impounded, or sequestered.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.096" offset="1355734">Now, our position is this that the statute reads very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.820" offset="1378617">It says that the refund only comes into being after the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.707" offset="1414248">In other words, here we have a case where bankruptcy was taken in September of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.531" offset="1441520">In the Sussman case, which was a case I referred to a moment ago being in the Third Circuit, that was filed in July of the -- of the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.434" offset="1485093">In the Fournier case which is out of First Circuit that was filed in December of that taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.775" offset="1518425">The Court being that at the date of filing for a petition of bankruptcy being the 20th -- 7th day of September of 1961, the bankrupt had no property right, and here's why.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.837" offset="1574745">Because he had to conclude and complete all the year of 1961 before there could be any slight resemblance to any kind of a claim he might make.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.202" offset="1616227">He might anticipate.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.893" offset="1622915">He might dream of that he has one, but here's what occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.054" offset="1639633">Number one, he had the additional months of that year to complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.206" offset="1656247">Supposing he earned up money to offset his losses, then there would never have a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.912" offset="1682996">Supposing, number two, that whatever clauses he thought he might have was denied by the Internal Revenue Department, supposing by some other windfall he makes profits in some other way, still his position as far as the date of his bankruptcy he had nothing --</text>

            <text syncTime="427.082" offset="1811728">I was wrong in saying that because it would make no difference what the Internal Revenue office does.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry Klepak</label>
            <text syncTime="432.830" offset="1834715">That's right, exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.319" offset="1840671">Now the First and Third Circuit, Sussman case was the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.981" offset="1859271">And the judge very reluctantly, the judges very reluctantly held with the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.442" offset="1893125">And they say so, and they say it's a windfall but they say the statute reads exactly the way it says and we're not going to attempt to change the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.401" offset="1937011">That is for Congress to do, not for the Court to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.128" offset="1951848">In the Third Circuit or rather the First Circuit, they adopted the findings of the First Circuit, took exactly the same position and use the same word of windfall and they too took the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.672" offset="2002108">They also added to the position that he did not have a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.166" offset="2020080">They provided both the provision of 31 U.S.C., that's Section 3477, which says declaring all assignments of any claim upon the United States absolutely null and void unless made after the allowance of such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.922" offset="2103045">The ascertainment of the amount due and the issuing of a warrant for the payment thereof or provisions for the protection of the Government and not for the regulation of equities of claimants growing out of regular assignments when collection is complete and the Government's liability ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.501" offset="2177337">Well, that is cited for purposes of showing that one, if you just think you have a claim against the Government, you're in no position to make an assignment until the Government recognizes it and the amount of ascertained and the finding is made in your favor, then you may do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.292" offset="2240554">Now, there are a number, as I say, these decisions were not popular.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.063" offset="2259675">And when I appeared before the Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, I was armed with the First Circuit's opinion and the Third Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.502" offset="2289351">And Mr. Rochelle came up with just some magazine articles and a few law journal reviews and I thought I was well armed.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.031" offset="2323519">But apparently, the Fifth Circuit didn't take the same view because the Fifth Circuit “swam around” and said this and I do bring this to the Court's attention because this is a test case.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.339" offset="2364688">This is one of the first impression for this Court because we now have our Circuit Courts in conflict and I would do want to recite -- or cite rather from the Circuit Judge who ruled against me this language, “This appeal presents a question of prime importance in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.848" offset="2450787">Now, the reason that you find so much noise about that in the journals is that the referees in bankruptcies have discovered that this might be a tremendous thing to make because they could then take all the loses the bankrupts may have had and check back and see if they have paid any income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.685" offset="2534066">There might be a source of revenue or income to the bankruptcy courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.505" offset="2553396">On the other hand, here is something that we must just think about when we do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.804" offset="2570637">Number one, presuming I am wrong about the fact that there isn't -- that there was a property right, just presumingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.631" offset="2613896">Then, this comes to my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.199" offset="2624136">The statute provides for a three-year loss-carryback and the five-year forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.103" offset="2651826">Now, what happens here?</text>
            <text syncTime="638.746" offset="2658408">Here in September, take my client's position, in September 21st, 1961, they take bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.010" offset="2691427">Now, they had to do something to the remainder of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.437" offset="2701145">What they did, none of us know.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.754" offset="2710340">There's nothing in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.279" offset="2720475">The referee in bankruptcy makes those findings as to how much additional loses may have been sustained by my clients between September and December the 31st of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.446" offset="2781184">Now, the Fifth Circuit, in order to justify its finding, it does this.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.437" offset="2801142">It says, one, that this one involved shouldn't go to the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.884" offset="2818905">It should protect the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.543" offset="2829563">And that this refund should then go back to the bankruptcy court and made available for questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.228" offset="2852237">Now, if he's trying to -- if the Court is trying to protect the creditors, he is only protecting the creditors who are listed in the -- in the schedule of bankruptcy in the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.438" offset="2901138">What about the creditors that were created between September the 21st and December the 31st?</text>
            <text syncTime="706.230" offset="2928306">They are not in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.839" offset="2934680">Now, whatever loses they may lose to these people, they're not protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.858" offset="2954846">So when you get the listing, you get another problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.631" offset="2965922">How far can you reach out if this law abuses the taxpayer right to go five years forward?Does this mean that a bankrupt for five years has his hands tied?</text>
            <text syncTime="725.813" offset="3006673">Does it mean that anytime in five years, that the referees or the trustee in bankruptcy, he comes and asks “I want to see your books.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.606" offset="3077831">Now, there's got to be a closeout somewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="747.453" offset="3093191">I think very seriously that it was or is windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.311" offset="3108655">The amount of money that's involved in this case is nothing because when we did make to recover of these refunds, the small business administration has the money come and it grab its money real quick and left us with some pennies.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.583" offset="3161736">But we had an issue and we have one which we felt was important.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.763" offset="3178454">And more especially, if you think we have our Circuit Courts who do not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.169" offset="3196008">Now I'll say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.883" offset="3202905">It's true that the opinions of the First and the Third Circuit were not very popular but by the same token, my clients of bankrupt weren't very popular to their creditors back home either.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.461" offset="3245223">But in any event, I think what you're going to have to do -- you're going to have to construe the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.403" offset="3264972">And there's only two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.645" offset="3269987">One, does Section 7 (a) of the Bankruptcy Act does it if the language by introduces property including rights of action which prior to the filing of a petition, prior to the filing of a petition, he could by any means have transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.660" offset="3357968">Now, could the bankrupts in this case on September the 21st, could they, when the statute meritoriously says, “You cannot make an application for a refund until your whole taxable year has been completed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="827.973" offset="3415228">Could they on September the 21st stop, put an application, right then and there or ascertain a claim that we got a refund coming right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.124" offset="3451904">No, the statute prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.027" offset="3459532">The statute where it specifically says, “If you have to complete your calendar year”, the calendar year of December 31st.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.485" offset="3489311">So the question is, did the bankrupt have the property right in the anticipated, if they could have been anticipated, and they anticipated lost or loss-carryback and refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.704" offset="3542183">The second part is that presuming you find that there was a property right, then the next question is, does -- is it in conflict with the statute that prevents the assignment of a claim against the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.547" offset="3601533">Now, there are other cases that are cited both sides and I think there's was a quite conflict on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.362" offset="3628805">But I think there is no conflict on issues, strictly one of law, this question as to whether or not there was a property right at the time of bankruptcy and such a nature that it could have been transferred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.163" offset="4240071">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Associate Justices, it may be somewhat unusual to commence an argument with emphasis on what the case is not about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.008" offset="4287404">However, in this particular case, I think it is essential to a proper understanding that we emphasize that this case does not involve the right to net operating loss carried forwards in the trustees like in no contention in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.303" offset="4364622">Also this case does not involve rights to refund in any taxable year after the date of bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.465" offset="4413210">Neither does this case involved loses incurred after the date of bankruptcy and prior to the end of the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.581" offset="4461693">Now, if it did involve such loses, I think no particular problem would be presented because as suggested by the Fifth Circuit in the opinion below, it would be a simple matter to prorate the refund, that portion of the refund attributable to the loses incurred prior to the date of bankruptcy, would go to the trustee and that portion of the refund determinable losses incurred after the date of bankruptcy and prior to the end of the taxable year would go to the bankrupts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1349.887" offset="5502934">In bankruptcy, the corporate shell does not pass to the trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.302" offset="5684537">To be proper -- to be right which passes to a trustee in bankruptcy under Section 70, the right must pass two tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.211" offset="5720168">In the first place, it must be property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.325" offset="5732707">And in the second place, it must be property which is transferal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.955" offset="5751202">So if I may address myself to the first of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.985" offset="5783280">This right to a refund is a vested statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.519" offset="5809403">Indeed, the first words in 26 U.S.C.A. Section 172 are, “There shall be allowed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.892" offset="5854960">Now, admittedly, the realization of this right is postponed until after the end of the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.808" offset="5882650">Admittedly the amount is uncertain until the end of the taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.947" offset="5911176">But postponement of right to realization certainly could not affect the status of this right as property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.786" offset="5942523">Otherwise, a note receivable payable to the bankrupt but not yet to due would not pass to the trustee, nor there is uncertainty of time and amount or contingency in other words affect the status of this right as property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.501" offset="6021413">Now, in our State of Texas, we deal and trade in everyday the most contingent possible kinds of rights, those in oil and gas for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.809" offset="6078568">When there is a transfer of rights under an oil and gas lease, sometimes the transferor will reserve an overridding royalty interest to take effect after payoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.092" offset="6123708">If conceive of anything more contingent than this, in the first place, there's got to be discovery of oil and gas in paying quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.351" offset="6156727">The second place, there's got to be payout of the person who drill the well, this may never happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.970" offset="6183267">But this doesn't affect the status of that overriding royalty interest as property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.730" offset="6202284">And indeed these interests are transferred in substantial amounts of money everyday, nor has there ever been a question that such a highly contingent and speculative right would pass to a trustee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.255" offset="6268426">There are many cases cited in the opinion of the Fifth Circuit in the trial court below and in our brief, where contingent rights have been held to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.299" offset="6316596">This Court in Williams against Heard held that the right passed to the trustee in spite of the fact that at the time of bankruptcy in 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.293" offset="6360586">There wasn't even a right which existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.226" offset="6372289">There was only a loss, the right may become into being and if Congress made provision for an award under the treaty in 1886 some 11 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.636" offset="6421922">And now, in (Inaudible), a contingent remainder was held to pass in spite of the fact the remainder stood to be entirely defeated if the beneficiary pre-decision is (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.919" offset="6471032">Horton against Moore was another case for the Sixth -- Fifth Circuit involving the same type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.536" offset="6489527">And then the Ninth Circuit, Kleinsmith -- Kleinschmidt against Schroeter, a man had forfeited every right he had in a mining venture except the possibility that it his erstwhile partners later sold the venture and got enough money for it to pay them back for their advances, then he might back in for some sort of contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.981" offset="6599346">This contingent interest was held passed by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.123" offset="6623901">There are other cases which are applicable and important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.259" offset="6640410">Now, as to the transferability of the right, this Court held in Spindle v. Shreve that what is transferrable is a question of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.848" offset="6698715">There has never been any doubt that under Texas law where this case arose, contingent interest are transferable, in cases recited in the brief for that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.625" offset="6745840">I think there's been no doubt that it's -- that common law contingent claims as far as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.317" offset="6772590">Now, I would not presume to advise this Court whether or not contingent claims are assignable in Pennsylvania or whether they are assignable in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.187" offset="6816162">There are cases cited in record incidently, at page 22, the whole of that contingent remainders in Pennsylvania are not assignable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.710" offset="6862242">But Sussman did not bottom its decision on any contention that contingent claims are not assignable in Pennsylvania, nor did Fournier bottom its decision on New Hampshire law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.159" offset="6923995">Sussman's result came about because the Court said, “You can't assign under the Assignment of Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.072" offset="6979688">Now, as long ago as 1828, in Comegys against Vasse, this Court held or this Court inquired, is it a possibility coupled with an interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.021" offset="7035486">If it is, therefore it said, then it passes through the trustee then called the assignee in bankrupts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.031" offset="7135483">The Third Circuit in Sussman said and I quote, “Perhaps this expectation can be described as a contingent claim against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.917" offset="7183026">Thereby, I think admitting that this is a contingent claim, then they said, “But.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.109" offset="7211760">It is contrary to the Assignment of Claims Act and therefore is not transferable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.455" offset="7237151">Now it's unfortunate I think but I think it's also true that with the pressure of the dockets, that our good judges on our Circuit Courts are forced to rely more and more on the help they get from counsel and have less and less time for independent research, nobody apparently called the attention of the Third Circuit to Erwin against the United States or the United States against Gillis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.986" offset="7343313">Both decisions by this Court which established the rule which has been enforced for many, many years that the assignments of -- assignment of Claims Act has no applicability to assignments by operation of law or transfers by operation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.121" offset="7427845">They said it has no applicability to the enforceability of the assignment as between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.468" offset="7449266">It is designed, yet the statute is designed for the protection of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.156" offset="7472044">Now, a trustee takes under Section 70 by the very wording of the statute “by operation of law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.385" offset="7504959">And therefore, it is unfortunate that the Third Circuit did bottom their decision on this, which so plainly has gone through Erwin against United States and United States against Gillis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.876" offset="7546859">Now, the First Circuit -- the First Circuit in Fournier, which followed Sussman, avoided that anti-assignment statute was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.619" offset="7585834">They based it from the idea that the right was followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.344" offset="7844760">I think it does, Mr. Justice Harlan, because the -- because the Third Circuit said, “Perhaps it is brought but it is rendered nonassignable by virtue of the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.483" offset="7901288">And these decisions of this Court has said, the statute does not render a claim against the Government, nontransferable by operation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.266" offset="7944443">It has no application from that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.903" offset="7974954">Now, Fournier, by the First Circuit cited one case and that was the Sussman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.743" offset="8014346">There was no mention on Williams against Heard, or Comegys against Vasse or Horton versus Moore, or Kleinschmidt against Schroeter, or the many, many other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.462" offset="8065233">Now there again, we must presume that the First Circuit was not made aware of the decisions of this Court on contingent claims passing to address the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.466" offset="8109223">Certainly, had it been made aware of such decisions, these decisions at least would have justified some comment or some effort to distinguish, but they were not mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.276" offset="8148511">The only case cited by Fournier was Sussman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.046" offset="8171604">Now, before I close and in order that this Court perhaps maybe read of me and Mr. Klepak today, I would like to emphasize that the practical effects of a holding which would sustain the rule of Sussman, the Court there admitted that this is a windfall to the bankrupt that the -- the expense on his creditors, the refunds coming about by reason of the losses incurred with these credited money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.123" offset="8287901">But now I would point out also through the Court that the Sussman rule would act as the greatest possible encouragement to prospective bankrupts to run up their losses prior to filing a voluntary petition, doing anything which might result in an increase loss at the expense of their creditors who increase the refund with which -- with which they might go south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.145" offset="8399914">Last -- last month, before the National Association of Referees in Bankruptcy, representatives of the Department of Justice and of the Securities and Exchange Commission appeared and gave papers on how racketeers are moving in to the bankruptcy area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.969" offset="8479222">They pointed out that they will go into a community acquire control surreptitiously of an ongoing concern with a good credit ready, build up huge inventory, sell it off, perhaps it is sacrifice in order to convert it to cash either put the organization in the bankruptcy or permit it to go in with the trustee getting an entirely inadequate set of records and no way to trace, and the racketeers going south with the merchandiser, the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.055" offset="8607640">Now, what a greater attraction to these gentleman would it be if they could also go south with the mid-operating loss-carryback refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.816" offset="8650585">I will close but I would urge upon -- that the court of bankruptcy is essentially a court of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.443" offset="8701158">And in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Bankruptcy Act, if the bankruptcy court applies principles and rules of equity jurisprudence, the powers of the Court have been invoked through the end that fraud will not prevail, that substance will not give way to form, that technical considerations will not prevent substantial justice from being done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.028" offset="8827486">Those are the words of this Court in Pepper versus Litton in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.033" offset="8851519">They are applicable today even more so than they were then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.608" offset="8869804">And I think and submit that they have special applicabilities to the case involved.</text>
