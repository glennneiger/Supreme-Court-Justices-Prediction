            <label>Mr. Stanford Shmukler</label>
            <text syncTime="22.051" offset="191613">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.431" offset="221080">This case is here on a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Jersey which denied a petition for post-conviction relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.826" offset="270712">The -- there was a murder, a homicide at 6:10 p.m. on a Friday evening, January 24th, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.396" offset="320972">At 1:30 p.m. the following Tuesday, a defendant by the name of Godfrey was arrested in the company of someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.281" offset="360469">The petitioner Cassidy was not arrested until 4 a.m. in the morning, Wednesday morning, after the homicide January 29th and petitioner Johnson was not arrested until 5 p.m.that evening, Wednesday evening, the 29th of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.376" offset="436851">After the arrests of these three individuals during those two days, the three of them gave a total of six statements, incriminating statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.091" offset="487737">From the time each of them were arrested, they were in the complete custody of the police and they were in custody for quite sometime as will developed during the course of the arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.783" offset="550536">Now, it is our position that the argument here falls into three major categories of arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.726" offset="582301">First of all, we are suggesting that the means of eliciting these confessions and using them at the time of their trial, during the time when they were not advised of their right to counsel, they were not advised of their right to remain silent and to make no statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.545" offset="669550">They were not permitted to see family.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.328" offset="688671">They were not proceeded -- permitted to see counsel even though they requested it.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.195" offset="712182">They were held for several days without a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.503" offset="737364">Although, I will put note that to say that one of the petitioners was given a form of a hearing, he was arrested not at the scene of the crime where they were ultimately tried in Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.127" offset="783862">But he was arrested in Newark and there was a form of a preliminary hearing during which apparently the only thing that happened was a transfer of custody from the Newark police to the Camden police.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.501" offset="837360">Nothing in the record shows us exactly what took place there, although, we do have an affidavit of that petitioner that he was not advised of any rights or told of his right to counsel at that time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="194.851" stopTime="197.206">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="194.851" offset="882813">Is there a coerced confession claim in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanford_shmukler" startTime="197.206" stopTime="526.653">
            <label>Mr. Stanford Shmukler</label>
            <text syncTime="197.206" offset="892217">Yes, sir, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.229" offset="896293">There is in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.943" offset="911130">First of all, we feel that the totally of the circumstances here under which they were illegally detained, they were held incommunicado.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.510" offset="949373">They were not told of their right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.574" offset="961703">They were confronted with the confessions of the other defendant who late -- which later were held to be coerced by the Third Circuit that the totally of all these circumstances show that these people were overborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.686" offset="1026069">And we also wish to urge that the interpretation of the Escobedo case which we feel means if the Six Amendment is giving effect to the Fifth Amendments shows that the absence of counsel here and the absence of an advice of their right to counsel deprive them of the one feature which is essential on all confession cases, the right to make a free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.784" offset="1150516">They did not have the right to make a free choice because they were not in possession of the facts necessary to make a free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.269" offset="1188446">We have another line of arguments here which does not involve the Escobedo interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.627" offset="1225853">And that is that these individuals who sought separate trials, who sought to have their cases severed and who sought during the course of the joint trial after they were refused separate trials, the use of this cross-implicating confessions against each other deprived them of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.831" offset="1310699">In the sense of the Aranda decision in California and as now seems to be the practice announced in a New York and a New Jersey case, Young case which is cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.613" offset="1365870">And lastly, the inflammatory comments and summation by the prosecutor deprived them of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.203" offset="1408188">Now, I might state that there were two other issues which were raised in our petition for certiorari which have been rendered both by decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.977" offset="1443297">One issue concerned the use of a gun which we claim was obtained from them under a promise which was not kept and we recognize that the Linkletter case renders this argument moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.334" offset="1496691">Likewise, we raise the question that the prosecutor's comment on their failure to testify supported by the court's charge on that point violated the Malloy and Griffin cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.100" offset="1567744">However, this Court in deciding Kean has certainly mooted that point insofar as we talk about the retroactivity of the Malloy and Griffin points.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.598" offset="1609749">As we pointed out in our reply brief which is I assumed in -- I distribute to the Court although it was printed rather late, we were unable, the Court printed it and I think it was distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.731" offset="1662307">We do not give up the argument which we'd made in the principal brief that the prosecutor's comments on the failure testify, also affected or taken in totality of the circumstances of his entirely inflammatory summation suggested inferences which were not supported by any facts and that those comments taken along with the others violated in -- violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights not the Fifth Amendment right as we -- as had originally been suggested in connection with the Griffin and Malloy.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.026" offset="1815489">Now, addressing myself to the question of the means of eliciting and using these confessions, these -- first of all, the background on these individuals we think is relevant here to show the need for counsel at this stage which certainly, if we have to give the label was passed the accusatory stage because when the first of these petitioners was arrested, Cassidy, he had already been apparently identified by the other people who had been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.270" offset="1976404">Certainly as to Johnson, he was told that he had been identified as the finger man.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.631" offset="1997928">They did not come in and picked up a man near the scene or who might have some information about the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.264" offset="2020394">They were here to arrest these individuals, to place them under arrest and charge them with the crime for which they were ultimately tried and convicted and give him the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.912" offset="2066996">Cassidy is 25 years -- was 25 years of age at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.351" offset="2084760">He'd only completed an eight grade education.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.903" offset="2095000">He had never had any contact with the -- with a police in the sense of being arrested or convicted of any crime before and the psychological data which is part of the record showed that he was a highly conflicted, immature individual with deep feelings of incompetence, inadequate personality, and that he needed narcotics to alleviate his anxieties and he was very passive and repented individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.578" offset="2209729">And there is --</text>

          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="526.653" stopTime="532.354">
            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="526.653" offset="2209938">Did the police know that?</text>
            <text syncTime="529.283" offset="2220492">When they invest -- when they interrogated him?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanford_shmukler" startTime="532.354" stopTime="569.111">
            <label>Mr. Stanford Shmukler</label>
            <text syncTime="532.354" offset="2232822">Sir, I've -- Justice Fortas, I would say that although there is no admission on the record by any of the police officer who made that arrest it was -- it should have been obvious to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.087" offset="2279737">And especially in light of the petitioner's testimony at (Inaudible) -- at the motion for new trial hearing that he was under the influence of narcotics at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.107" offset="2335848">This should have been apparent to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.016" offset="2343476">Now, whether they knew of his eight grade education, whether they knew his age, I assume they elicited that from him when they spoke to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.852" offset="2374823">The psychological data --</text>

            <label>Justice Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="569.111" offset="2379839">There wouldn't be very likely they know whether he was schizoid personality, couldn't they in the part of the submission here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stanford_shmukler" startTime="576.129" stopTime="910.668">
            <label>Mr. Stanford Shmukler</label>
            <text syncTime="576.129" offset="2407842">Yes, Justice Fortas.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.954" offset="2411186">I doubtedly would've known that and I doubted any of us would know that without the report of a psychiatrist or psychologist which of course was obtained here after they had been incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.247" offset="2456325">Johnson on the other hand was only 21 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.918" offset="2467088">He had only had a seventh grade education.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.456" offset="2477223">He had only one prior conviction and the psychological data is set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.931" offset="2503137">He was -- had intense feelings of insecurity and inadequacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.874" offset="2522885">He was grossly inadequate with a schizoid personality and his ability in judgment would go to pieces under duress and strain.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.284" offset="2560502">Now, these individuals with this limited ability to stand up to the official detention and custody were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.060" offset="2615568">The first one, Cassidy was arrested at 4 a.m. in the morning in his home with seven police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.472" offset="2645243">He was taken to the Camden Police Station where he was confined thereafter and according to the affidavits, he sought -- he tried to consult with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.907" offset="2687039">He wanted to consult with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.723" offset="2694248">He wanted to consult with family and he was refused permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.085" offset="2711698">There was no warrant for his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.108" offset="2727790">In other words, a middle of the night arrest, large number of officers held incommunicado, his first confession was given five hours later.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.872" offset="2770840">This wasn't sufficient for the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.683" offset="2778154">They came back and they got another confession in which he modified his former confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.662" offset="2798007">That was two hours later and then another 11 hours -- 11 and a half hours later, a third confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.688" offset="2850147">The other petitioner, Johnson, was arrested in Newark and was held there at five o'clock in the evening, far from home, taken to the police station in Newark.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.880" offset="2898944">Held there until this night court when apparently nothing happened that was significant to him or at least nothing which significantly warned him of any of his rights or gave him any advice or succor under these trying circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.411" offset="2961011">He was brought back to Camden in the middle of the night at 1:30 or 2 o'clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.061" offset="2983581">They put him the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.681" offset="2990059">They drove him to Camden with a stop for a cup of coffee.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.823" offset="3002702">During the time he claimed, he was questioned during the entire ride.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.187" offset="3020152">In fact, he claimed that he was beaten during the course of this ride.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.966" offset="3035199">And it wasn't until 4 o'clock in the morning, 4:45 in the morning that he gave his incriminating statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.377" offset="3068844">Now under these circumstances, we believe that it is fairly clear that he needed the help and advice of a friendly face of an adviser, of someone to give him some kind of advice, and the Honorable Solicitor General has said that under these circumstances the only advice an attorney can give is to tell the defendant to keep quiet.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.039" offset="3191515">I would like to differ with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.213" offset="3196217">I think there's a lot more that an attorney can do under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.184" offset="3216071">At that point, counsel could have advised him of the legal significance of admitting to a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.402" offset="3252955">Now in the Escobedo case, the Court made a point of the fact that the defendant admitted to complicity in a crime not realizing the legal significance of that complicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.276" offset="3312515">In this case, it became extremely important because this case was tried on a felony murder theory that there was a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.579" offset="3349713">The petitioners have argued that there was no felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.479" offset="3369253">There was no robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.327" offset="3376671">That they had gone to the store to obtain money from the store -- toy store operator, the man, the victim, the deceased which he owed to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.926" offset="3419094">He owed to them not for a very nice purpose because apparently they had delivered some narcotics for him and they went there to get the money that he owes them, not to rob him.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.781" offset="3458487">Therefore, when these individuals are held under these threatening, coercive circumstances, and are told that they are wanted -- they want a statement from these individuals as to what part they've had in this murder -- this robbery murder and they admit to being participants in a robbery they have signed their own doom without knowing the significance of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.398" offset="3564962">Admitting to a robbery would've seen to them untrained and uncounseled by legal counsel at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.345" offset="3600802">Admitting to the robbery was a small matter compared to admitting to the homicide and what did they admit to?</text>
            <text syncTime="880.981" offset="3627342">Well, Johnson admitted that he had been the one with the gun and he gave somewhat exculpatory statements as to why he shot the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.736" offset="3666317">But mostly incriminatory admitting that there had been a participation of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.253" offset="3688364">Cassidy and Godfrey for that matter, in effect said that Johnson was the man who did it and they didn't know anything about robbery and they didn't go there armed and so forth and so on and then changed this during the course of their second and third statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="914.683" offset="3762134">Justice Black, there was a -- apparently what happened is that when the shooting occurred, a neighbor of the toy store operator run out, saw the defendants or two of the defendants leaving the store, get into a car, somebody observed them drive away in a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.555" offset="3825560">And then because they made a minor traffic violation, they made an illegal left turn somebody took down the license number of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.990" offset="3855339">And through the license number they were able to trace them, get to Godfrey, who subsequently -- when he was arrested was in company of a fellow by name of Noah Hamilton, who subsequently told all he knew and they had discussed this with Noah Hamilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.564" offset="3917615">And there was also a fingerprint of one of the defendants found on one of the items in the store.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.301" offset="6152547">Apparently, it was simply just a transfer of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.668" offset="6166026">There is a rule in New Jersey which says that a person who was arrested is to be taken before the -- a magistrate in the -- within -- without any unreasonable delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.172" offset="6224018">This is set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.594" offset="6233736">This was violated certainly in the case of Cassidy and probably in the case of Johnson because this rule goes on to say not only should he be brought before a court or magistrate, nearest available magistrate and the compliant shall be filed forthwith and a warrant issue thereon a preliminary hearing before the magistrate shall be held forthwith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.832" offset="6326732">And then the Rule goes on, this is New Jersey revised Rules 3-3:2-3 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.494" offset="6357347">The next subsection of that Rule goes on to say that the magistrate shall advice him of his rights and of his rights to have counsel and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.879" offset="6398934">This was not the proceeding which took place in Newark.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.409" offset="6464972">He was then returned to the Newark jail, was held there till 1:30 at night, was apparently questioned during that period of time, he was then placed in a car, taken back to Camden, on the road he was continuously questioned, and finally, started his confession at 4:45 in the morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.255" offset="6600391">I don't think that -- there is certainly nothing in a testimony of any of the officers what was done there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.532" offset="6629543">There is an affidavit contained in the petition or it was considered by the Supreme Court of New Jersey, I should say in this case, setting forth what the defendant Johnson said happened there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.088" offset="6691715">He said, he doesn't really know what did happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.885" offset="6706866">His statement was that he didn't know what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.708" offset="6730167">He was taken there, somebody handed up some papers and he was taken out again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.487" offset="6745318">And that's set forth in the -- in his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.157" offset="6767992">The -- is certainly clear that the petitioners here did not have the right to make a free choice as to whether to admit, to deny or to do anything else because they did not have the facts available to them at the time that these statements were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.607" offset="6893798">Now, it's clear that in the record, the only warning that was ever given to them was the warning which was given to them when the formal recording of the confession took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.939" offset="6943117">And this was the warning by the -- by Chief Dube, Chief of the County Detectives, as they took him into the room to record their confessions that you -- any statement you make must be freely given and voluntary and truthful and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.619" offset="7029844">They are not advised of their right to counsel or their right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.980" offset="7051264">In fact, it's doubtful whether New Jersey even requires that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.389" offset="7076968">Now, it is our contention here that the Escobedo case did not introduce a radical new departure from the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.912" offset="7130990">That the Escobedo case was merely the next logical step and if there are no more problems of administration created by applying Escobedo in our case on a collateral attack then would be the -- applying the doctrine that a confession which is obtained by psychological pressures, might have created after the Court's holdings previously might have suggested that only physical beatings were sufficient or extending it to the mild weeps of refusing to give him access to his wife as in the Haines case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.901" offset="7290964">But this was not a radical new departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.004" offset="7307368">Thus, in the terms of (Inaudible) in the Linkletter cases, the reliability of the guilt determining process is just as much involved here where these defendants confessed to items which they did not realized the legal significance of and which could very well have been false because it just -- they had no knowledge of the legal significance of this anymore than Escobedo did in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.224" offset="7428263">Now, in the -- in connection with the -- by the way I might to say that, I think that the question of obtaining the confession of one defendant and then using it as a technique to obtain the confessions of the other defendants is -- just highlights this need for a legal counseling at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.995" offset="7527320">As the illegal detention, the violation of the New Jersey Rule discontinued, protracted, questioning during a period of time when the very police officers were violating their New Jersey Rules by not taking him before the nearest available magistrate for the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.051" offset="7595551">By the way, they did not actually get taken to the magistrate until the 31st, which would be Friday, would be two days after Cassidy was arrested and the day and a half after Johnson had been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.270" offset="7660440">Now likewise, we want to go -- we'd like to point out that the use of those confessions in a joint trial over the objection of the defendants that they were so cross incriminatory and request from the defense counsel to strike this cross incriminating portions and this was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.921" offset="7763048">In other words, they asked, if you're going to allow Godfrey's test -- confession to be used in evidence, cross out, delete the portions relating to Cassidy and Johnson and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.066" offset="7807666">This was denied and we contend that this technique of trying three defense together and introducing six confessions all of which were cross-incriminatory violated their rights to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.361" offset="7868792">We have done account and apparently Wayne Godfrey's statements mentions Stanley Cassidy, his first statement mention him 67 times and the second statement 19 times or a total of 86 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.436" offset="7933158">And he mentions Sylvester Johnson 48 times in his first statement and nine in the second statement or 57 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.021" offset="7963460">New Jersey now apparently is following a rule where it will permit this type of evidence to be deleted or grant new trial -- grant separate trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.865" offset="8002853">This is what was requested here and it was not given.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman Heine</label>
            <text syncTime="3694.241" offset="14880371">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.969" offset="14883297">With the history, however, given to him by the subject, by the defendant but we relate it back as to what he was a year and a half ago and what he was as a young child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.273" offset="14936482">The district judge, the federal district judge on the application for habeas never reached the question of the psychiatric reports or psychological reports but determined that on the record, the confessions were voluntarily given and he only denied the petition for habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.368" offset="15032822">Appeal was then taken to the Third Circuit, who again reviewed the record and again since the psychiatric and psychological reports came up just because they were attached to the petition, they formed part of the record in the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.831" offset="15094680">There again, the State told the Circuit Court of Appeals, “Do not consider any psychiatric or psychological reports because they are not part of the record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.018" offset="15147447">The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district judge in denying habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.953" offset="15179212">Certiorari and appeal was made to this Court and again certiorari was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.070" offset="15211604">Then they filed an application for a post-conviction relief proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.422" offset="15245040">They filed an unverified petition not supported by any affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.682" offset="15270118">There's a legal argument before a trial judge who determines now that you haven't made out a case on your petition that would fall within the provision of Escobedo, this was already after Haynes and Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.645" offset="15345977">The trial judge then denied their petition for a post-conviction relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.869" offset="15366875">An appeal is then taken to the New Jersey Supreme Court and here again, very strange practice is introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.832" offset="15398745">They file affidavits with the New Jersey Supreme Court in support of this petition for post-conviction relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.798" offset="15430614">These affidavits were never before the trial judge and in these affidavits the New Jersey Supreme Court says, “We will consider them arguendo as if they had been filed with the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.975" offset="15483277">We don't think they make out of case under the facts of Escobedo."</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.314" offset="15504593">There's one other situation that I think discloses the whole pattern of their procedure in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.051" offset="15563525">Paragraph 11 of their petition filed for this post-conviction relief says this, it's very significant language, “Keeping in mind please that this is immediately following Haynes and Escobedo decisions of this Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.616" offset="15629876">The petition says this and I quote, “None of the contentions advanced in this petition was raised in any of the prior proceedings, each contention rest upon a recent development in the law or a newly established fact.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.598" offset="15701765">End of the quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.448" offset="15721200">The affidavits filed in the New Jersey Supreme Court and I'm not criticizing my Supreme Court for how we consider that because they figured they -- they'd only decide that they had no factual basis and didn't rise to constitutional requirements anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.919" offset="15799045">The language of this affidavits seemed to (Inaudible) because now for the first time we hear that there was a request by someone by one of more of these defendants to contact their family</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.534" offset="15849514">And then we find that following Escobedo there's an allegation in this prisoner's affidavit that he was never advised and I quote, “Of the right to remain silent”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.561" offset="15905625">This is odd language coming from a defendant in the state prison who has this seventh or eighth grade education.</text>
