            <text syncTime="40.932" offset="267055">This case is here on the Government's direct appeal from the dismissal by a District Court in the Middle District of Florida of a one-count information charging the Standard Oil Company of Kentucky with having caused, suffered and procured the discharge of gasoline into navigable waters in violation of Section 13 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.337" offset="376769">The facts relevant to a disposition of the case appear in a stipulation which is at pages 5 to 7 of the trial -- of the transcript of record and that stipulation was entered into for the purpose of the motion to dismiss made by Standard Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.883" offset="442911">It discloses that in November 1963, after having completed the process of repairing and cleaning a line connecting the company's bulk storage tank, we have certain dock facilities on the same challenged river, the company, the employees, ran aviation gasoline from the tank into the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.859" offset="550849">They then accidentally left open the main shut off valve, and 300 gallons of the gasoline spilled from the line on to the docks and into the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.124" offset="919907">The amount of the spill just to return the facts very briefly was not sufficient to impede navigation or to cause any fire or explosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.341" offset="956688">But the matter was reported to the Jacksonville Fire Department and to the coastguard which arrived and dissipated the gasoline into the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.340" offset="988766">The St.Johns River is concededly a navigable water and the gasoline, it was concededly valuable and useable before it was unintentionally spilled into the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.294" offset="1032547">The relevant portion of the governing statute which appears at page 2 of our brief is -- and here, I'm just quoting the relevant portions, makes it an offense to throw, discharge or deposit, or cause, suffer or procured to be thrown, discharged or deposited from the shore, any refuse matter of any kind or description whatever, into any navigable water of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.149" offset="1151979">The District Court dismissed the information on the ground that valuable and useable materials such as the gasoline in this case was not refuse matter within the meaning of Section 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.462" offset="1209240">Our contention here is that that was error because refuse matter as used in that statute does not make this -- the applicability of the statute turn on how valuable or useless the matter that spills under the river is to its owner but on the effect it has on the water into which it is spilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.227" offset="1308296">Since gasoline is clearly a polluting material, we believe that the stipulated fact stated in offense and that the District Court's order should be reversed and the case sent back for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.216" offset="1352286">Now our construction of Section 13, is supported we believe by the three standard touchstones for legislative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.677" offset="1386036">It's most consistent with the purpose for which the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.674" offset="1406098">It's -- our construction we believe is entirely clear as a matter of legislative history that it was Congress' intent to cover the kind of conduct that was involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.698" offset="1454164">And finally, we believe that even on the face of the statute itself construing the provision in its entirety, Section 13 as a whole, it would be clear to any reader of the statute that it must apply to use a valuable matter which spills negligently or unintentionally into a river as well as to useless matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.661" offset="1549981">Let me turn first to the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.452" offset="1569207">The -- it's entirely clear, we think from the very broad language that the statute uses and from the history -- the legislative course before its enactment in 1899, that Congress was concerned with two evils, one being obstruction to navigation and the second being the discharge of damaging materials or injurious deposits, as it was called in our predecessor statute into navigable waters, in other words, pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.208" offset="1696162">Congress also meant to cover the entire range of conduct which could lead to these evils.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.186" offset="1728136">The statutory terms which cover not only the throwing, discharge or deposit, but also anybody who causes, suffers, or procures, the word suffer is we think is particularly broad, discloses that Congress was reaching not only willful and intentional dumping but any form of negligence or other kind of fault which could cause the discharge of these kind of materials into the water.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.384" offset="2136900">The only question presently before the Court is, whether the District Court's reading of the statute was correct, in other words, whether the word refuse matter applies only to valueless rather than valuable materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.258" offset="3204368">Now, in terms of the statute's purpose, it hardly makes any sense to say that Congress intended to make it a crime negligently to deposit discarded material into a river, but not to make it a crime negligently to deposit valuable material into the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.564" offset="3277615">If the statute were in terms of willfulness, if the statute had a willful element then the fact that the material were not discarded or valueless, would be an indication, it would be some proof of willfulness because people can -- that can be presumed, would not be willfully depositing their valuable material, whatever it may be into the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="905.650" offset="3725981">In 1896, after -- there had been a series of river and harbor statutes mainly appropriations bill into each one of which there was (Inaudible) one or more provisions pertaining to pollution or destruction of the rivers, Congress delegated to the Secretary of War the task of codifying these areas provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.672" offset="3830053">And in 1899, that codification was submitted by the Secretary of War to the Senate and the relevance to -- the section, they were in effect 10 sections that were aided for the 1899 River and Harbor Appropriations Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.728" offset="3914271">And one of those sections is the present -- is the one here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.962" offset="3939244">Now, it's entirely clear from the discussion on the floor of Congress when the bill was introduced and we've reproduced that as Appendix B of our brief, that the Senator who presented it on the floor of the Senate as well as those who spoke in support of it and that's in effect the entire legislative history for all intents and purposes of Section 13, thought that they were doing nothing more than codifying existing law.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.839" offset="4054706">It included the River and Harbors Act of 1894, which appears at page 24 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.301" offset="4076544">And the River and Harbors Act of 1894 made it an offense, stated that it will -- it shall not be lawful to deposit a whole enumeration of materials and ended with the statement or any other matter of any kind into certain navigable waters for which Congress had appropriated by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.859" offset="4166823">Now that enumeration included for example, assets which certainly could be of a valuable material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.926" offset="4207052">And clearly we think, and I don't -- we think our appellee doesn't dispute this, that that statute covered valuable deposits as well as valueless one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.965" offset="4775267">Both of them had a long enumeration of materials which could not be deposited in the water and then concluded with general catch-all statements such as other waste of any kind or any other matter of any kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.560" offset="5453615">Finally, we submit that the statute on its face means and means to a careful reader of it exactly what we say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.706" offset="5494157">There are two portions to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.057" offset="5503561">The first provision, the first clause makes it an offense to deposit or suffer the deposit of refuse matter of any kind directly into the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.651" offset="5542013">The second is a narrower cause which makes it an offense to deposit material of any kind on the bank of the river if it's liable to be washed into the water and impede or obstruct navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.353" offset="5612753">Now we submit that if the District Court were right and if the first half of this statute meant to apply only to valueless material, that's clearly not true of the second half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.535" offset="5665520">The second half doesn't have the word refuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.319" offset="5676596">But if the District Court were right, there would be a -- an inexplicable gap in this law because what Section 13 would be providing with the -- that it would be an offense to negligently deposit valuable material on the banks of a river, from which it could be washed in to the stream, but it would not be an offense negligently to deposit the same obstructive material directly into the stream if they're valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.732" offset="5790281">Now, any as I -- as I say, any careful reader of the statute is bound to conclude that if the second half of the statute makes it a crime negligently, for example, if you're driving pass the banks of the river with a -- with an open truck full of logs which you're taking to build the log cabin some place and you negligently allowed the logs to fall off the truck on to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.879" offset="5898846">And these logs are likely to be washed into the water and obstruct navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.552" offset="5917550">Well, that's an offense under the second half of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.250" offset="6352332">Well, in this area Mr. Justice Harlan, as opposed to some of the cases which the appellee has cited there's really not very much reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.792" offset="6394546">Appellee cited for example cases in which -- particular illustration being that the Harris case in 177 U.S. in which the statute was unclear as to whether it imposed a certain duty on the defendants in that case and duty to have the cattle removed from the train that was carrying them from one place to another in water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.800" offset="6486601">But now, there I think the defendants been effect plan their conduct in accordance with their construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.166" offset="6528084">When -- what we're dealing with this negligence or on a strict liability, this is far less of this kind of reliance, in other words, Standard Oil knew it was liable, knew it is probably doing something responsible to itself by -- and possibly violating the statute when -- if any oil negligently or any gasoline negligently escaped into the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.402" offset="6617004">And in any event, we submit that a reading the statute on its face of course are construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.649" offset="6769977">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.046" offset="6787532">Mr. Lewin has set forth the facts of this case I think precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.604" offset="6809788">I add to that only the fact that Standard Oil Company when this -- the land was being aired during the cleaning process as a safety precaution and when they reopened the land from the shore tank to the dock side, the employee in-charge of it had left open the valve that the other -- and he immediately saw it run over and closed the valve but a few hundred gallons had spilled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.161" offset="6916054">Standard Oil then called both the Fire Department and the coastguard as a safety precaution.One which we submit would be inhibited by any such interpretation of this law as the Government would impose on people of absolute liability irrespective of cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.222" offset="6996302">They called the coastguard and once that call was made, even though the thing with them -- a very minor insignificance, it was said into effect this full weight of the Governments -- an investigative and enforcement procedure ending up this day before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.381" offset="7064848">The statute that's involved in this case, Section 407 of Title 33, prohibits in very plain language the throwing, discharging or depositing of any refuse matter of any kind or description other than sewage, a tremendous pollution exception, other than all sewage in the navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.413" offset="7157008">It was plainly an anti-obstruction statute as any sort of reading of all of the first section of 33 U.S.Code will evidence you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.218" offset="7192221">It's an anti-obstruction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.411" offset="7209044">The first half made it unlawful to throw, discharge or to deposit any refuse matter of any kind in the navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.149" offset="7239973">Now the Government in this case was faced with the fact that the material that was deposited was valuable aviation gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.164" offset="7272051">That can't be changed so the only way they could proceed under this statute is to eliminate the word, the descriptive adjective written from that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.914" offset="7307055">And they have eliminated it by -- it by analogizing and saying that refuse matter is synonymous with any matter of any sort or any foreign matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.662" offset="7358046">And that is -- that's any matter of any sort of pure water, Mr. Lewin was perfectly frank about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.169" offset="13576025">If the 1890 Act lists 18 different kinds of material and every one of them was a waste product, a refuse, a residue, saw dust, ashes, cinders, it's everything and then finally concluded with refuse or waste matter of any sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.210" offset="13760240">And I submit our own case is the best and most conclusive evidence that you'd done that that certain inspection is off and absent.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="3478.790" offset="14018539">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.717" offset="14022196">I just like to cover two -- three points that were raised in the appellee's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.621" offset="14061902">First of all, it seems to me the important point with regard to this statute that must be recalled is that Congress was legislating with regard to what harmed river is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.121" offset="14099832">And it's equally of harmful to rivers when injurious deposits are put in there whether the owner personally wants them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.111" offset="14127835">It doesn't make any difference to the river what the owner is subjective and can't is, whether he wanted to throw it in or whether it ended in there negligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.220" offset="14164302">So far as the Oil Pollution Act is concerned, and that was right, the Oil Pollution Act of 1924 applies only to deposits of oil from ships into coastal waters, it wouldn't cover this kind of a deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.621" offset="14217906">And the problem at the time, the reason that the Oil Pollution Act was passed had nothing to do with whether the statute applied to refuse or not but it was because of a limiting construction which we submit was a misconstruction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.950" offset="14271195">The reading this refuse act is defined only to obstruct the materials that the Oil Pollution Act was passed and that that made entirely clear that ships in coastal waters were committing offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.841" offset="14314768">And of course, let the Refuse Act and specifically did left any other Act enforced that would apply to cover violations of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.664" offset="14354056">And Mr. Hadlow's there repeated references to our illustrations regarding the sunken barge, we don't contend and didn't contend that that was a violation of Section 13 because it was entirely -- insofar as we can tell inadvertent or an accident in line with your line of questions Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.084" offset="14455724">That illustration was put into a footnote in our brief only with reference to an alternative argument which we made for the construction of the word refuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.341" offset="14492714">And that construction was supported by the decision of the Second Circuit by the late Judge Learned Hand and we put the -- a reference in the footnote in there to explain what it would cover and what it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.697" offset="14554154">And finally, although -- I must say that Mr. Hadlow say that this is a -- just a very minor case, of course the readings from prosecution don't appear from the record but we contend that this has to be left to the good sense of prosecutors and that there was good cause in this instance to proceed criminally against this discharge of valuable matter into navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.655" offset="14681945">It doesn't appear in the record but there was good cause.</text>
