            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="89901">Justice Stevens has our opinion this morning in case 06-427, Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association versus Brentwood Academy.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="11.766" offset="136921">This case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.628" offset="156357">The Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association which I will refer to us TSSAA is an association of high schools that regulates interscholastic sports among its members including Brentwood Academy, a private school.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.950" offset="221663">TSSAA prohibits its members from using undo influence in recruiting middle school students for their athletic programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.714" offset="256667">In April 1997, Brentwood’s football coach sent a letter to several eighth-grade boys inviting them to attend spring practice sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.899" offset="297418">The letter explained that football equipment would be distributed and they getting involved as soon as possible would definitely be to your advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.643" offset="332422">It was signed “Your Coach”.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.740" offset="340781">Even though, none of the boys had yet enrolled within the meaning of the TSSAA rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.703" offset="364709">As the case comes to us it is settled that the coach’s pre-enrolment solicitation violated the TSSAA anti-recruiting rule and that he had ample notice that his conduct was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.844" offset="417268">TSSAA accordingly, sanctioned Brentwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.899" offset="429493">After proceeding through two layers of internal TSSAA review Brentwood brought this action against TSSAA and its Executive Director in Federal Court under 42 U.S.C. §1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.762" offset="484872">As relevant here Brentwood made two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.396" offset="495426">First, that the enforcement of the rule was state action that violated the First Amendment and second that the adjudication by the association violated fair procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.613" offset="544327">The District Court and the Sixth Circuit found for Brentwood on both accounts, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.245" offset="570868">In Part I, of our opinion we described the history of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.930" offset="585601">In Part II, we discussed the First Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.319" offset="599080">In Part II-A which is joined only by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer, I explain that the anti-recruiting rule governs person-to-person solicitation rather than speech to the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.117" offset="654355">In Part II-B, speaking for the court, I explained that Brentwood made a voluntary decision to join TSSAA and to abide by its anti-recruiting rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.927" offset="693539">Just as the government’s interest in running an effective workplace can in circumstances outweigh employee speech rights so too in an athletic league’s interest in enforcing its rules sometimes warrants curtailing the speech of its voluntary participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.020" offset="761979">While TSSAA may not have unlimited authority to condition membership on the relinquishment of any and all constitutional rights, it surely may impose conditions on speech that are necessary to regulate an efficient and effective state-sponsored high school athletic league.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.944" offset="853617">We agree with TSSAA submission that hard-sell tactics directed at middle school students could distort competition between high school teams, and foster an environment in which athletics are prized more highly than academics.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.162" offset="914534">The First Amendment does not excuse Brentwood from abiding by the same anti-recruiting rules that govern the conduct of its competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.962" offset="949748">Part III of the opinion discuses Brentwood’s claim that was deprived of a fair hearing because the TSSAA board considered certain evidence that had not been introduced in the formal hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.249" offset="994887">They did not however consider anything not already known to Brentwood or prevent or deny Brentwood a full opportunity to explain the relevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.893" offset="1037414">If there was a due process violation it was clearly harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.048" offset="1054028">Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.027" offset="1073986">In which the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia and Justice Alito have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.687" offset="1092585">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
