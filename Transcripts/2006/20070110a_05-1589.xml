            <text syncTime="631.222" offset="2678300">Your Honor, I'd like to make the further point that... and I think this is a fairly obvious point, but we think that since under your decisions the State can prohibit a union from collecting an agency fee altogether, that it is reasonable for the State to impose a condition on that collection which falls, falls far short of actually prohibiting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.023" offset="2777565">We further point out that in the Hudson case the Illinois statute at issue was effectively an opt-in statute, a statute under which no amount that was not germane could be collected in advance, unlike the more generous Washington State statute which allows the union, permits the union, to collect a fee in an amount equal to dues or would permit it to collect a fee which had been reduced in advance to reflect non-germane or reduced just to reflect 760 expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.340" offset="2882786">It seems to us that it is within the power of the State to establish such a condition in the interest of an election's integrity by means of protecting the First Amendment interests of the non-members, and we think the statute does that very well without imposing in fact a substantial administrative burden on the union in this case or unions in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.587" offset="2963766">For example, the, the way that the WEA or any union can comply with Section 760 would be to simply place an additional form in the Hudson packet they send out.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.994" offset="3013399">Now, recognizing that the Hudson packet is about this thick, that it is received by the teachers in September, the busiest month of the year for teachers, and that there is no form currently provided in that packet whatsoever to allow people to opt out, but rather a statement that you must send a letter to the union to opt out, we think it's quite easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.206" offset="3094274">And we look to the WEA PAC for instruction on what they could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.525" offset="3115590">But now.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.975" offset="3117366">Because the WEA has chosen to form a PAC and is required to solicit members and non-members if they choose in order to contribute to that PAC, they do a very good job of soliciting members.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.535" offset="3167626">They include a very convenient form encouraging people to check off and send their dues in to the PAC to support candidate elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.956" offset="3197301">They provide no such form for the opt-out process, but it would be easy for them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.010" offset="3221542">The burden imposed on them is not great administratively, as they suggest, any more than the burden on the other teachers unions in Abood or in Hudson because it can easily be met through these simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.484" offset="3267413">If there are no further questions, Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.696" offset="3336272">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="798.314" offset="3346721">The statute at issue here imposes only a narrow limitation on the union's use of agency fees, namely by requiring the affirmative assent of the non-members before the union may use those funds for non-germane political expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.258" offset="3406489">The statute does not limit the union's ability to spend its own money on political causes and every avenue that is available to any other organization in the State to solicit contributions from non-members remains available to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.833" offset="3468765">The court below nonetheless struck the statute down only by treating the workers' minimum constitutional rights as a constitutional ceiling as well as a floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.475" offset="3511397">In the process, the court below rigidly constitutionalized an area of labor law in which the States and the Federal Government have at least since the Lochner era enjoyed substantial discretion to make labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.799" offset="3564687">We would request that the Court reverse the decision below, but also reverse and restore room for play in the joints in this area of labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.221" offset="3598333">I think the starting problem with the court's analysis below is that the rights that are at issue in this area principally are the rights of the individual workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.160" offset="3634068">This court has recognized that agency shop itself raises significant First Amendment issues and First Amendment impingements and so the forced extraction of fees is justified only to the extent that it can be justified by the government's interest in maintaining labor peace or in avoiding free ridership.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.289" offset="3706584">So as a minimum constitutional matter, the workers have to have an opt-out right.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.693" offset="3724243">The question is whether the States can go further and either do an opt-in regime or do what was at issue in the Hudson case and not even allow the union to collect the non-germane funds in the first place from non-members.</text>

            <text syncTime="918.508" offset="3827479">I mean, I think there might be an argument at that point that somehow the Federal Constitution requires more than opt-out rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.844" offset="4252857">As I say, it's a question that's certainly raised by the Davenport Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.914" offset="4269157">I think there's an answer to it and I'll get to it in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.263" offset="4278561">But I would say in fairness to Mr.... one of the anomalies of this case is that in many respects I think that's a more difficult constitutional question than the one that the Washington Supreme Court answered adversely to Petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.472" offset="4327358">I think, if I can sketch an answer as to why it is that the opt out is the constitutional minimum and there isn't as a matter of constitutional law required to be an opt-in right, I think it goes back to what the Court has construed as the relevant First Amendment interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.766" offset="4388484">And the Court has seemingly construed the relevant First Amendment interest here in not having a compelled extraction, and as part and parcel of the constitutional violation, it seems to have assumed there's a need for a stated objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.907" offset="4441043">And I think that's where you get the opt-out right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.026" offset="4449611">And so if you put it in the analogy, an analogous compelled speech context like Willie against Maynard and the New Hampshire license plate, in that context an important parcel of the violation is the objection to having "Live Free or Die" on your license plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.869" offset="4508961">And the Court hasn't construed the compelled speech there to be that everybody has a compelled speech violation because they are presumptively forced to have the license plate on the back of their car.</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.064" offset="4685758">I mean, you have in a case like this, a 100-page packet, I'm told, that has no... no form in it that you're supposed to return to opt out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.087" offset="4721807">You basically have to go to the third page, find the address of the president of the union, and then send in a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.741" offset="4748452">And I think it's instructive if you look in the joint appendix, I think it's at page joint appendix 45, you have the form that's available to union members to opt in to PAC contributions, and have payroll deductions made for the PAC contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.417" offset="4803100">The union certainly makes it much easier to opt in to PAC contributions than it makes it to opt out vis a vis the Hudson packet.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.226" offset="5178323">And I think at the end, if you again put the text of the relevant provision together with the overall purpose, it's clear that it's trying to protect the rights of workers but it's doing so in service of a broader intent of improving electoral integrity, and I could suggest where maybe the Washington Supreme Court went awry in its analysis, it focused almost exclusively on the three stated purposes that were included in the text of Initiative 134, which were all focused more on electoral integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.612" offset="5295874">That's not surprising, because there were 36 sections in Initiative 134 that dealt with the whole manner of different campaign finance initiatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.052" offset="5329624">Before this initiative was passed by the voters of Washington there weren't any campaign contribution limits in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.071" offset="5357732">So this initiative is doing a lot more work, just besides Section 760.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.359" offset="5374868">I think 760 isn't unrelated to those broader purposes because it does make sure that the contributions of the workers here are voluntary, and I think that is certainly something that's very similar to what Federal law accomplishes through the separate segregated fund requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.219" offset="5442369">If I could make just one note about the fact that this targets unions and not other entities, I think two points are relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.289" offset="5466610">The first is that argument was very clearly waived, and if you look at footnote 6 of the Washington Supreme Court opinion which is at 25a of the... of the State's petition appendix, it's clear that any argument about the, the disparate treatment of unions versus corporations or other entities was not before that court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.225" offset="5778408">One, the statute before the Court is a campaign finance law that was enacted for the purpose of protecting the public's interest in the integrity of the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.532" offset="5823547">Two, it is a content-based restriction on speech, which cannot be justified by the State's authority to limit agency fees in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.923" offset="5869105">Three, the statute does not serve a compelling State interest both because it is overbroad in restricting, restricting speech on ballot propositions and because it's underinclusive in regulating the campaign speech of unions but not of other comparably situated entities.</text>
