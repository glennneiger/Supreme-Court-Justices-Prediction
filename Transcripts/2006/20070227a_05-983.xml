            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="156756">We'll hear argument this morning in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.154" offset="185282">Mr. Andre.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jean_claude_andre" startTime="9.872" stopTime="122.629">
            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="9.872" offset="196149">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.843" offset="216106">This case asks the Court to decide to what extent non-lawyer parents of a child with a disability may litigate an IDEA case pro se in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="251215">Under two distinct theories, the answer to that question should be without limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.817" offset="267933">But I would like to focus today on petitioner's primary and first theory, which is that parents are real parties in interest in IDEA suits regardless of the claims being asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.273" offset="309834">Under 28 USC 1654, a party has a right as a matter of Federal statutory law to litigate their own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.445" offset="342434">Accordingly, when a parent sues under IDEA, it is our position they are suing in their own right and are suing on their own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.968" offset="376603">This is particularly so because the right to sue provision that Congress enacted in IDEA uses the broad phrase "any party aggrieved" when it allows judicial review of an adverse administrative hearing officer's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.644" offset="431251">The parties agree that it is the underlying administrative complaint or the due process complaint that frames both the claims that can be brought eventually in court, and also identifies who the parties are that can appear in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.487" offset="490601">Those complaint provisions in IDEA, and there are eight of them in all we cite in footnote seven of our reply brief; all eight of those provisions refer unambiguously to the parents' complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.843" offset="528113">Congress did not describe this due process complaint that starts the whole dispute process as the child's complaint, the child's complaint by and through the parents, or the parents' complaint on behalf of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.917" offset="576387">Accordingly, when a parent files that due process complaint, they are the real party in interest, and again, the provisions make no distinctions about the kinds of claims that can be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.923" offset="608361">It shouldn't matter that when they get to Federal court that... or there shouldn't be any limitation on who is the real party in interest in Federal court, or what claims may be asserted.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="122.629" offset="647231">If we say that the parents are the real party in interest and are entitled to sue in their own right, is that the end of the case, or do we reach the second... a second question as to whether or not they can represent the children?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="135.353" offset="698118">I don't think you would need a reach a second question, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.472" offset="710552">It's our position that the remedies in an IDEA case are co-extensive and that the rights are inseparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.644" offset="735316">And so, this case was pleaded in such a way as to have both the parents and the child be before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.714" offset="763528">But if this court were to agree with us on our first and primary theory, we don't believe it would be necessary to have the child listed as a plaintiff to a future suit, and we imagine that on remand the child might be dismissed from the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.706" offset="815564">It's our position that he's not an indispensable party.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="167.241" offset="825700">What can the parents get out of this case other than reimbursement for the tuition they've paid to private schools and procedural rights that are given them by the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="182.251" offset="885677">What can they get out of this case other than those two things that do not depend upon their status as representatives of the child?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="194.458" offset="934578">Well, clearly the relief primarily sought by my clients... in fact, if you look just at the relief section of the complaint that my clients filed, which is in joint appendix, page 19, the only relief they actually seek is reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.968" offset="984524">There's a number of ways--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="208.051" offset="988913">What other possible relief could they seek other than giving them a procedural right accorded by the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="217.157" offset="1025380">What other possible relief could they seek that they would not be seeking as guardians of the child?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jean_claude_andre" startTime="224.762" stopTime="243.391">
            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="224.762" offset="1055786">--Of course, it's our position that parents are never acting as guardians, at least in the legal sense, or lay representatives of a child in a court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.135" offset="1093194">And so, therefore, a parent should be able to assert any one of the... a claim asserting violation of any one of the many rights conferred in the Act.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="243.391" stopTime="257.733">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="243.391" offset="1130287">It depends upon their being a party aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.478" offset="1158604">That is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as a party entitled to a remedy.</text>

          <turn speaker="jean_claude_andre" startTime="257.733" stopTime="258.951">
            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="257.733" offset="1187652">Correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="258.951" stopTime="285.468">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="258.951" offset="1192459">Now if the only remedies the parents are entitled to in their own right are reimbursement, which is at issue here, and procedural guarantees, why would not their ability to sue or to appear pro se be limited to those two categories?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.664" offset="1271349">You'd win this case, but I'm talking about how broad is the rule that you're urging us to adopt?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jean_claude_andre" startTime="285.468" stopTime="345.892">
            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="285.468" offset="1298620">Well, in... and this could be a very easy case if the Court wants to look just at the specific procedural violations that my clients assert and also the reimbursement claim that they assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.543" offset="1338849">But it's of course our position also that the full bundle of rights can be asserted by parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.328" offset="1354000">I think maybe the best way to answer your question, Justice Scalia, is that... to direct you back to the definition of a free appropriate public education itself, and that's in 1401(9) and (29) in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.719" offset="1407603">That definition provides that a free appropriate public education is one that's provided at no cost to parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.389" offset="1430278">So if a school district provides a free and inappropriate public education, then it's the parents' obligation... or not obligation... they have the choice of whether to supplement the inappropriate public education with additional services, or to replace the public education with one that provides an appropriate bundle of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.751" offset="1499659">So I guess my point is that even in a case where the parents don't necessarily seeks reimbursement, they still are intended beneficiaries of the right to a free appropriate--</text>

            <text syncTime="347.925" offset="1548456">The child is entitled to an appropriate public education and the parents are entitled to have it provided free.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.783" offset="1587848">That's really the only interest they have on the table, it seems to me, separate and apart from their status as representatives or guardians of the child.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.469" offset="1710624">Well, you say they're the co-architects.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.337" offset="1718043">I mean, are you saying anything more than they are given the procedural right to participate in the hearing?</text>

            <text syncTime="395.639" offset="1739254">--I think they're given... I haven't counted them... but I think they're given 10, 12 of the 15 procedural rights outlined in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.709" offset="1763496">And this Court explained in Rowley, Congress placed every bit as much emphasis on parental involvement in the shaping of the individualized educational program--</text>

            <text syncTime="410.732" offset="1799649">Isn't there a bit of... there's a leap from saying they have these various procedural rights and they're are a party aggrieved by the decision rendered after the hearing, that's a different question, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jean_claude_andre" startTime="422.189" stopTime="445.222">
            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="422.189" offset="1845416">--Well, typically a parent would file a due process complaint, challenging the bundle of services offered by the school district, and alleging a procedural violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.664" offset="1887316">And so I think it would be a rare case where a parent would, by the time they get to Federal court, try to be a party aggrieved is something that they didn't exhaust... that would render the exhaustion requirement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="445.222" stopTime="490.267">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="445.222" offset="1937576">They are an aggrieved party for purposes of the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.209" offset="1961504">The question is whether that... when that is done, whether they also constitute an aggrieved party.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.231" offset="1993582">And one of the... one of the points made by the other side is that there is an express provision for proceeding without counsel at the administrative level, and there's no provision for proceeding without counsel in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.109" offset="2073099">So doesn't that suggest that the right to proceed pro se is limited to the administrative process?</text>

          <turn speaker="jean_claude_andre" startTime="490.267" stopTime="532.178">
            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="490.267" offset="2117820">No, not at all, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.786" offset="2127852">Congress sensibly recognized that because the process proceedings are run on a State by State basis, certain unauthorized practice of law statutes or other laws require prohibiting counsel in administrative proceedings might come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.812" offset="2187933">So Congress had to make it express in section 1415(h)(1) that any party may appear in the administrative proceedings with or without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.333" offset="2221997">In contrast, in Federal court, there's already 28 U.S.C. 1654, which has been on the books since 1789 as part of the Judiciary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.424" offset="2254389">That provision allows any party to litigate their own case.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.209" offset="2265569">So it actually makes a lot of sense that Congress would have included the express right to proceed pro se--</text>

            <text syncTime="534.362" offset="2294199">I mean, you're assuming that the parents are a party to the case in Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.433" offset="2314470">--Well, again, it is our position that they are because they're parties aggrieved by the administrative proceedings, so long as they have exhausted their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.937" offset="2344459">And that this is confirmed in other provisions, for example, the attorneys' fees provision of the statute refers repeatedly to parents as a possible prevailing party.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.440" offset="2454487">But our primary theory in this case is not that parents are seeking to represent their children as lay advocates in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.141" offset="2477265">Our primary theory is that a parent suing under the statute is suing in their own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.693" offset="2495447">In fact, that's why my clients pleaded this case with... as... with themselves on the caption, and asserted claims that are their own, because they believed that those claims are their own, and they believed they should be able to litigate those claims under section 1654.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.405" offset="2570366">Counsel, who are referred to as officers of the court, protect the court from frivolous suits, from suits that really have no basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.415" offset="2630343">When we give that authority to appear in court and initiate a suit to the public at large, we make a lot more work for Federal district judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.435" offset="4634457">And while the parents have to show that there was a denial of a free appropriate public education, we think it's clear that the statute makes the claim the parent's claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2372.225" offset="9645579">Leaving aside how we should classify the reimbursement right or classify reimbursement, you make a broad distinction between the substantive right of the child to the free appropriate public education and on the other hand, the procedural rights of the parent in going through the process that ultimately comes to a conclusion for the child's benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.042" offset="9744844">The conceptual problem I have is that I don't understand why it makes sense to say that the parents have procedural rights unless that procedural... or unless those procedural rights of the parents are in aid of some substantive entitlement for the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.171" offset="9821435">We give procedural protection to people in order to vindicate some substantive interest that they can claim, and you're, in effect, splitting those two apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.811" offset="9863963">You're saying one person has a substantive right, the other people have procedural right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.049" offset="9888936">And I don't see conceptually how you can make that split.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.251" offset="9901683">And if you don't make that split, then it only makes sense that the right to the free public... the free appropriate public education is, as the statute in one place seems to say, a right of the family group, the parents and the child together, rather than the right of the child alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3498.103" offset="14149089">We addressed this in our reply brief, but if the Court wishes to look at pages 78 and 88 of the joint appendix, particularly page 78, there it is clear that the Petitioners were seeking reimbursement in their own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.244" offset="14193706">On the page 153, that Respondent refers to, I assume that that point in time we were now on appeal to the second tier of the Ohio administrative proceeding, and perhaps at that point in time, Monarch School was actually paying for Jake's education on a grant-like basis, because that was something that happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.855" offset="14268103">And that perhaps at that point in time Petitioners referenced reimbursement to Monarch because Monarch had actually been expending the fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="3610.825" offset="14599963">The way Maroni did it however was by adopting our primary argument here today, which is that parents possess the right to... to sue in their own name, as pro se litigants, not as lay representatives of their children, and seek to enforce the full bundle of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.419" offset="14662343">Congress very well could have looked at Maroni and said aha, that's what we intended all along; Maroni got it right, and then they just put... Congress just put the thumb on the scale a little bit by enacting the attorneys fee provision which made it clear that parents can be, or are the prevailing party if the plaintiffs prevail in an IDEA action.</text>
