            <text syncTime="6.475" offset="170194">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.907" offset="183987">This case concerns the constitutional sufficiency of California's catchall factor (k) instruction, which was given in the penalty-phase portion of California capital cases, and which directed the jurors to consider any other circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the crime, even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.729" offset="263294">In this case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that this instruction violates the Eighth Amendment because it allegedly misled the jurors to believe they could not consider so-called forward-looking evidence that did not relate directly to the defendant's actual culpability for the crime itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.172" offset="329018">In the State's view, the Ninth Circuit's conclusion is fundamentally flawed, because it rests on an illusory distinction between different forms of character evidence in a way that is inconsistent with this Court's prior decisions in California... or Boyde versus California and Brown versus Payton.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.523" offset="398400">In Boyde, this Court addressed, and rejected, a virtually identical challenge to the factor (k), and concluded that this instruction did, in fact, allow jurors to consider non-crime-related evidence; specifically, it allowed the jurors to consider evidence of the defendant's background and character.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.105" offset="472796">There was nothing in the Boyde decision to support the Ninth Circuit's distinction between different forms of character evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.991" offset="508323">In fact, Boyde implicitly acknowledged that the factor (k) would, in fact, be understood to encompass Belmontes' good character evidence, in this case, because, for all practical purposes, there is no meaningful distinction between the nature of the background and character offered in Boyde and the nature of the background--</text>

            <text syncTime="128.414" offset="657952">In footnote 5, this Court addressed a contention, raised for the first time in argument, that Boyde's evidence might be admissible under Skipper versus South Carolina, and this Court distinguished Boyde from Skipper, for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.384" offset="717825">First, as the... as Your Honor pointed out, the evidence in this case related to good-character evidence, events that occurred before the crime itself, unlike in Skipper, which dealt with post-crime events.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.414" offset="769965">The Court also pointed out that the evidence in Boyde... his dancing achievement, his good character evidence in that case... was not offered for the specific inference that the evidence in Skipper was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.542" offset="822524">The Court, in footnote 5... and in the opinion, in general, in Boyde... nonetheless found that this evidence did, in fact, constitute good... character evidence of the... of the defendant's present good character, because it showed that his crime was an aberration from otherwise good character.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.593" offset="894726">Or, as Justice Marshall put it in his dissenting opinion, that Boyde had redeeming qualities, which is a decidedly forward-looking consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.351" offset="933701">And, as I was saying, the evidence in this case, and in Boyde--</text>

            <text syncTime="213.250" offset="997335">The... and, in fact, the Court has, in Franklin versus Linite, said that they have not distinguished between different forms of character evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.987" offset="1028264">And I understand that, in the past, we've always discussed background and character evidence as sort of the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.589" offset="1054700">In this case, however, the Ninth Circuit's conclusion does, in fact, rest on a distinction between different forms of backward-looking and forward-looking character--</text>

            <text syncTime="301.866" offset="1351765">And, in that light, the jurors are very well aware that their only determination in a California case is to make a moral, normative determination, a single normal... moral normative determination, as to whether this man, this defendant standing before them in this Court today, deserves death or life without possibility--</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.281" offset="5061466">But then, in the next breath, he said,</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.996" offset="5080274">And, again, reasonable jurors, hearing this... having been given the instruction here... would reasonably interpret this... all of this evidence as something they could use to extenuate the gravity of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.555" offset="5130534">And particularly in this context, because, like in Boyde, in addition to this factor (k), the standard instruction directed the jurors to consider all the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.151" offset="5176927">The first factor of the enumerated factors... (a) through (g), in this case... told the jurors that they should... that they should focus on... that the first thing to consider was the... or the circumstances of the crime itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.873" offset="5239830">The final factor, therefore, that any other circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the crime would clearly be understood to relate to matters outside the crime itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.489" offset="5282253">And, to the extent that there was any ambiguity about the meaning of that in this particular case, the argument by counsel, the additional instruction here, clarified that to the point that there is certainly no reasonable likelihood that the jurors felt that they were constrained in considering any mitigating evidence in any way they thought fit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.005" offset="5932388">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.009" offset="5956421">Here is Respondent's 60-second nutshell summary of our core position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.173" offset="5989022">This case does not turn on the constitutional factor (k) standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.048" offset="6008561">Rather, it turns on a straightforward application of the Boyde test, to the unusual, unique circumstances that occurred during the arguments, instructions to deliberations at the penalty trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.795" offset="6059552">Here are the two key components of our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.128" offset="6072823">During arguments to the jury, both counsel conveyed to the jury that Belmontes' evidence of Youth Authority religious experience was not covered by factor (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.458" offset="6134158">However, both counsel suggested to the jury that it should be considered anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.313" offset="6161534">Now, this is unusual, because, of all... of all the things that the district attorney and the defense counsel disagreed on, this was one that they did agree on, and it's likely that the jury would have taken note of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.500" offset="6206361">The case then proceeded to instructions and deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.472" offset="6226214">The jury came back to court, announced that they were deeply divided, perhaps with a majority favoring life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.256" offset="6249306">The turning point occurred when one juror, Juror Hern, requested judicial confirmation that the specific list of factors previously given was the only base... was the only framework within which the penalty decision could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.058" offset="6316597">At that point, the trial court had a constitutional obligation to disabuse Juror Hern and the rest of the assembled jurors of that misapprehension and, at the very least, to reinstruct the jurors that the enumerated factors were merely illustrative and not exhaustive, and instruct the jurors that the jury had to consider all of the mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.176" offset="6421087">The trial court did neither, with the result that the jury all too likely returned to its deliberations with the belief that the only factors... the only matters they considered... could consider were those encompassed within the enumerated factors, and believing... based on counsel's prior arguments... that factor (k) did not include the Youth Authority religious-experience evidence.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3254.758" offset="13163396">Thank you, counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.387" offset="13169874">Mr. Johnson, you have 6 minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark A. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="3260.341" offset="13185652">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.854" offset="13195787">In a minute, I'd like to briefly touch on the Teague issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.907" offset="13215954">At the time Belmontes' judgment was pending, there was no precedent that would have dictated the Ninth Circuit's conclusion here regarding the sufficiency of the factor (k) instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.064" offset="13260571">And, indeed, this Court's subsequent holdings, in Boyde and Payton, bear out the fact that it was at least... that that decision certainly was not dictated by precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.824" offset="13315637">In Boyde, this Court dealt with evidence of good character that was precisely the same as the evidence of good character here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.330" offset="13349701">The... Belmontes' evidence of having succeeded during a prior commitment and religious conversion, that he might be able to help others in the future, was good-character evidence in the same way that Boyde's evidence of having won a dancing prize, of having helped children, of having helped artistic... having artistic abilities, was all good character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.843" offset="13431725">And there is certainly nothing in Boyde to suggest that there is any distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.875" offset="13451787">But, even if there was, it would not be one that would compel all rational jurists to distinguish the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.639" offset="13482925">And that's further buttressed, of course, by this Court's more recent opinion in Payton, which found that it was at least reasonable for the State Court to conclude that Payton's post-crime forward-looking evidence would be understood to fall within the factor (k) instruction if it was at least reasonable for California to find that such forward... post-crime forward-looking evidence would fit within the factor (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.776" offset="13579474">The Ninth Circuit's conclusion, to the contrary, regarding pre-crime good-character evidence, certainly was not dictated by precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.651" offset="13606955">I'd also like to address, quickly in my remaining time, Mr. Multhaup's arguments regarding the jury... or the argument of counsel and the jury questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.661" offset="13658991">Again, Boyde counsels that the relevant consideration is whether there is any reasonable likelihood that the jurors view the instructions in a way as to foreclose consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.739" offset="13719281">In this case, both... the jurors were instructed with the factor (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.173" offset="13741015">As I've said, they were given the supplemental instruction that said that the... that the previous listing... factors were only examples of some.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.499" offset="13774347">And then, both counsel clearly said that the jurors could, and should, consider this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.341" offset="13801724">Is there some possibility out there that some juror might have misinterpreted this in a... in a... in a different manner?</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.966" offset="13828160">I suppose so, but there is certainly no reasonable likelihood, especially in light of the fact that Belmontes' evidence, virtually all of it, was directed at this main thrust of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.315" offset="13877583">And, just like in Payton and Boyde, for the jurors to have believed that they could nonetheless not consider that evidence would have turned the whole proceedings in a virtual charade or a pointless exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.124" offset="13928783">So far as the questions during juror deliberations, it's, first, important to recognize, none of these jurors said anything to suggest that they were actually confused about whether they could consider any evidence offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.613" offset="13990746">Their question... Juror Hern's question merely related to her... she wanted to confirm her understanding about the role of balancing mitigating versus aggravating factors under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.192" offset="14041110">And certainly the parties there if... would have been in a better position to realize it if these questions somehow suggested some ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.428" offset="14070054">There was no objection there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.178" offset="14077054">Moreover, in the same conference, the judge advised the jurors to review the instructions again, which, of course, again included the factor (k), and which, of course, included the supplemental instruction that said that their consideration of mitigating factors was not limited to those that had been listed, but those that had been listed were merely examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.781" offset="14159497">If the Court has no further questions, I will submit the case.</text>
