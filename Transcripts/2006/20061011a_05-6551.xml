            <text syncTime="12.224" offset="200733">The procedure for imposing aggravated sentences under California's Determinate Sentencing Law implicates the bright line rule this Court set forth in Blakely and Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.013" offset="239916">Any fact other than the fact of a prior conviction which increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.470" offset="281712">The primary point of contention in this case is what constitutes the statutory maximum under California's Determinate Sentencing Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.958" offset="311701">Petitioner believes that it's the middle term, whereas respondent maintains that it's the upper term.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.279" offset="329046">In fact, this case really boils down to just one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.231" offset="344824">Can a judge in California legally impose an upper term sentence based solely on the facts reflected in the jury's verdict or the defendant's admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.003" offset="379933">The answer to this question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.987" offset="387874">California's Determinate Sentencing Law specifies three possible prison terms for each... for each felony conviction, a lower term, a middle term, and an upper term, although it mandates that judges shall impose the middle term unless there are factors of aggravation or mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.600" offset="466241">California case law confirms that judges must impose the middle term where there are no aggravating factors, and even the state appears to concede the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.772" offset="503022">Because the middle term is the greatest punishment a judge can impose based solely on the facts reflected in the jury's verdict, it, and not the upper term, constitutes the statutory maximum for--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="99.997" offset="551923">Mr. Gold, I know you take that position on the facts of this case, but is it not true that there could be cases in which the verdict of the jury would establish certain facts that would justify going beyond the middle term?</text>
            <text syncTime="112.756" offset="602914">For example, the Black case itself, as the justice who dissented in this case thought the sentence was permissible in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.946" offset="751707">Because otherwise... I mean, what I'm getting at is, otherwise, one assumes it would be a way of stating an element of the offense, and as I understand it, under California law, the element of the offense couldn't satisfy the additional fact necessary to jump up to the higher range.</text>

I think in most circuits, that would be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.141" offset="1428488">What the California Supreme Court in People against Black found, they used references to reasonableness as a label and a characterization to avoid the bright line rule of Blakely and Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.151" offset="1492540">Instead they tried to fit the Determinate Sentencing Law within the Federal system this Court found constitutional in Booker.</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.085" offset="11448223">I think if I read the opinion the way you're saying, I would say the California court, which is a good court, conscientious, managing a huge system of criminal law in the state, probably bigger than the Federal system, reads Blakely and they see that those guidelines in California as previously understood were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.200" offset="11544667">And they're thinking, how do we maintain this system as constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.270" offset="11569014">And therefore, they write 1261, which can be read as saying we're Bookerizing it, and we come as close to Booker as necessary to make it constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.614" offset="11622303">Now, that would be an understandable judicial reaction, and I can read the opinion as saying that, at which point I'm not certain what we're supposed to say, because I have no doubt that your unease reflects the fact that prior to Black, in California, it would have been pretty unheard of for a judge to depart upward on grounds other than factual grounds related to the circumstances of the crime or offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.149" offset="11748527">But I also have no doubt that this opinion is written to try to save the California system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2916.845" offset="11819267">And the reason for that is because California had already implicitly construed the system as making all three terms legally available based on the jury verdict alone, and had simply used a reasonableness requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.918" offset="11863570">And that goes back to Hernandez, back in 1988, when California essentially anticipated Apprendi, and distinguished between making enhancements available based on the jury verdict on the elements alone, versus the three, the three components of the triad scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.107" offset="13672289">The first is, Mr. Chief Justice, you were asking about what would be the effect in California on those that have already been sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.963" offset="13703740">The only information I have was what was contained in Black, that only 13 to 17 percent of cases are sentenced in the upper range.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.986" offset="13743864">But what the Court should also consider is that most... in most cases, the difference between the middle term and upper term is really only a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.009" offset="13775943">In this case, it is four years, which is somewhat unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.627" offset="13794437">So in those cases, a lot of the people will have already served their prison sentences by the time that they would be able to benefit from any result in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.172" offset="13856609">4.410 is just general objectives of sentencing.</text>
