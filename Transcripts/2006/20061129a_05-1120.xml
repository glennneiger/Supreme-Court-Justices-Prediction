            <text syncTime="13.324" offset="206976">If I may, I'd like to frame the merits very quickly and then turn immediately to standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.478" offset="235502">Although the case before you arises in an important policy area, it turns on ordinary principles of statutory interpretation and administrative law.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.400" offset="271237">EPA made a decision based on two grounds, both of which constitute plain errors of law reviewable under any standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.923" offset="301330">EPA's principle grounds was that it lacked authority over the emissions of the four substances at issue, even if they, in fact, endanger public health and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.314" offset="342917">That legal conclusion fails as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.730" offset="352530">As a fallback position, EPA declined to consider if these substances are endangering public health and welfare, claiming its policy approach made more sense than the regulatory scheme encompassed in section 1202 of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.990" offset="409582">Although EPA possesses a good deal of discretion in applying the statutory endangerment test, it cannot rest its ruling on impermissible grounds as it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.112" offset="446048">We are not asking the Court to pass judgment on the science of climate change or to order EPA to set emission standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.218" offset="474470">We simply want EPA to visit the rulemaking petition based upon permissible considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="88.439" offset="507384">Petitioner showed a wide variety of injury in fact, all of which are the kinds of harms the statute was aimed at preventing.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.961" offset="537477">For example, our uncontested affidavits establish that as a matter of physics, the more greenhouse gases accumulate in the air, the more temperatures are going to rise, ocean waters expand, and the seas rise.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.353" offset="587005">And of course as the seas expand, they rise everywhere around the world.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.583" offset="767982">The harm does not suddenly spring up in the year 2100, it plays out continuously over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.903" offset="793268">And even to the extent you focus on harms that occur in the future, there's nothing conjectural about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.141" offset="818241">Once these gases are emitted into the area, and they stay a long time, the laws of physics take over.</text>
