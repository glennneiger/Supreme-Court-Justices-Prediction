            <text syncTime="8.918" offset="186519">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.477" offset="196759">The constitutional error that occurred in Mr. Fry's third trial is the type of error that can result in a conviction of an innocent person.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.146" offset="231450">Notwithstanding the nature of the error that occurred in Mr. Fry's trial, no court has reviewed the effect of that error or evaluated the effect of that error under the constitutionally mandated Chapman standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.234" offset="287770">Mr. Fry's position is simply that he is entitled to one bite at the Chapman apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.808" offset="314101">In the California Court of Appeals, that State appellate court should have, but did not, rectify the constitutional trial error that occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.039" offset="359032">Had that court complied with this Court's precedent, that court would have first identified the constitutional error that occurred at trial, namely the chambers error, and second, reviewed the effect of that error, assessed the effect of that error under the Chapman test.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.078" offset="431130">The failure of that court to do so, the unreasonable decision-making of that court, relegated Mr. Fry to seeking relief in Federal habeas proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.261" offset="479926">It scarcely seems reasonable--</text>

            <text syncTime="103.457" offset="564668">And the fact of the matter is if he had filed a petition for writ of certiorari following that, it would have effectively been asking at that stage for a type of error correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.749" offset="613882">It scarcely seems logical that the scope of the remedy to which Mr. Fry is entitled for the constitutional violation that he suffered, that that should be curtailed based upon simply the unreasonable decision-making of the State appellate court in the--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="134.600" offset="689219">Well, if we're talking about what... where is the logic in the result that I believe you're position produces, which is that a prisoner who loses in the State court on harmlessness grounds, because the State court finds it's harmless, obtains no habeas relief in Federal court unless the error actually prejudiced him.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.836" offset="810219">Whereas if the State court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred on... or ruled on whether the violation occurred, whether there was any constitutional violation, then he would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable probability of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.080" offset="895169">Now, you know, why would there... what does he care whether... whether the error below consisted in an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous determination that there was no violation?</text>
            <text syncTime="198.793" offset="946055">Why should there be a different standard of review between the two?</text>

            <label>Mr. Victor S. Haltom</label>
            <text syncTime="202.120" offset="959326">--Justice Scalia, that's the point raised in the Solicitor General's amicus brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.056" offset="979074">And in Mr. Fry's case, what happened was that there was a harmless error analysis conducted, albeit truncated, by the State appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.893" offset="1022437">But it was not a Chapman analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.362" offset="1032259">And that failure of the State appellate court to engage in a Chapman analysis is contrary to this Court's precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.608" offset="1065278">It ignores Chapman, it also would be an attack on--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="233.261" offset="1083877">Let's assume another violation, the court erroneously determines... erroneously... that there was no constitutional violation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.306" offset="1132047">Its error is not with regard to the harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.179" offset="1155557">Why should there be one standard of review for one error and a different standard of review for the other, regardless of whether the State court conducted Chapman or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="268.874" offset="1226297">Our position in this case is simply following the logic of this Court's decision in Mitchell versus Esparza, that this Court or any Federal habeas court needs to consider what the State appellate court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.743" offset="1277810">You cannot divorce... there is the underlying constitutional violation that occurred in Mr. Fry's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.553" offset="1305082">Then that error is compounded when a State appellate court fails to assess the effect of that error under the Chapman standard.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="297.190" offset="1339564">You could say the same thing when the State court has erroneously determined that there was no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.016" offset="1362865">In that case, you apply the Kotteakos standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.607" offset="1377285">I just don't understand the rationale of applying a higher standard to the other error.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.348" offset="1460250">It wasn't until we got into the Federal court that there was an error determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.155" offset="1483446">As far as the State was concerned, there was no reason to engage in any kind of harmless error review, Chapman or Brecht, because there was no error.</text>

            <label>Mr. Victor S. Haltom</label>

            <text syncTime="343.777" offset="1525974">That's in pages 94 to 97 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.588" offset="1537154">The State appellate court concluded there was no error as a matter of State law in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.397" offset="1564426">The court also concluded that there was no constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.819" offset="1582085">Then in a footnote, footnote 17 on page 97 of the Joint Appendix, the State appellate court stated in the alternative, effectively, there was no prejudice that Mr. Fry possibly could have suffered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.251" offset="1639868">However, in making that alternative holding, the State appellate court, the California court, was applying what's known as the Watson standard, which as this Court has repeatedly recognized, is the functional equivalent of the Kotteakos type standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.248" offset="1799841">And for the latter, however, you say we have to apply Chapman.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.570" offset="1869118">We do... and I understand the position that you are raising, Justice Scalia, that there is a potential split in the logic there.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.223" offset="1903704">I don't think the Court has to resolve that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.833" offset="1910183">Some of the lower Federal courts have determined that now, in light of AEDPA, the Brecht standard has been completely supplanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.576" offset="1945187">Some courts have construed this Court's decision in Mitchell versus is Esparza to lead to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.184" offset="1975593">And that may very well be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.044" offset="1983012">However, I don't think the Court needs to ultimately address that proposition in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.550" offset="2061066">You would apply a different harmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into account the fact that it's collateral review rather than direct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.424" offset="6848579">Instead, in order to strike a proper balance between State and Federal interests, the actual prejudice standard of substantial and injurious effect on the verdict should be used in collateral cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.381" offset="7744370">Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was unreasonable of... an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, because that testimony of the witness that was excluded was not only material, it would have substantially bolstered the claim of innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.339" offset="7952201">When you're analyzing the denial of a defense type of evidence, a Chambers claim, you first look to see how it fit into the defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.569" offset="8005072">And so in the sense that something is better than nothing, adding a twelfth witness instead of eleven may improve the defense case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.985" offset="8054810">And yet nonetheless, when you move to the next question, which is, was there a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict in the case, and now you're not just looking at the defense, you're looking at everything that was available to the jury... it may be that there was still so much other evidence that it could overcome whatever increase you received on the defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.575" offset="11309144">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The distinction between collateral review and direct review is deeply rooted in the law, and what Petitioner is asking is to have the standard of review for harmlessness in collateral review become the same standard as direct review whenever the courts on direct review got Chapman wrong or unreasonably applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.347" offset="11412276">That is the exact same argument Mr. Brecht made in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.125" offset="11755316">I think what Justice Breyer, what this Court said O'Neal said is, the way you articulated it, instead of burden of proof is that it's a level of conviction on the part of the court and what the judge will say in, what the court said in O'Neal, is, do I think the error substantially contributed to the jury's verdict?</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.432" offset="11816547">And that is essentially what the court said here on 181 at the very bottom when it said</text>

            <text syncTime="2929.986" offset="11870777">So I don't think that this case in any sense could turn upon, whether we call it the burden of persuasion or the proper level of conviction on the part of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.999" offset="11902855">This court was not persuaded and that is all that matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.013" offset="11914872">When the court is not persuaded and not left in equipoise, the prisoner loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.748" offset="11933784">The second question you asked was whether we have a position on application of Brecht, and we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.402" offset="11956459">We've laid it out in our brief.</text>
