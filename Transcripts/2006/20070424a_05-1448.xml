            <text syncTime="9.106" offset="187351">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.156" offset="195606">After filing for bankruptcy, Crown Vantage decided to terminate 12 over-funded pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.010" offset="219012">By terminating these pension plans, Crown was able to provide its plan participants with 100 percent of their accrued benefits and at the same time recover almost $5 million in surplus plan assets for the benefits of both Crown's creditors as well as plan members who made individual contributions to those pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.756" offset="301977">After Crown made the decision to terminate these pension plans, it received a merger proposal from the PACE union to merge the pension plan into the PACE multi-employer pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.516" offset="352968">Crown rejected that proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.218" offset="363835">The Ninth Circuit held that Crown breached its fiduciary duty by not sufficiently considering that merger proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.455" offset="392778">This Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit for two separate and independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.608" offset="417333">First, merger is a nonfiduciary plan sponsor function and Crown could not have had a fiduciary duty to consider the merger proposal by PACE.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.833" offset="458293">A series of this Court's decisions beginning with Curtiss-Wright and continuing with Lockheed, Hughes aircraft and Pegram hold that decisions to create, to modify, to terminate, or to amend pension plans are sponsor functions, settlor functions under trust law, that are not subject to ERISA fiduciary duties.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="97.045" offset="539169">I could understand that if the plan is being set up or if there's going to be a change to the multiemployer plan while the business is ongoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.304" offset="596116">But in this situation, you, you say if the employer elects to have an annuity, then choosing which insurance company is going to supply the annuity, that would be a fiduciary function.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.485" offset="680857">Well, this is, the termination, the merger that's proposed here, is instead of having an annuity we'll put the assets into this other plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.012" offset="743028">It's quite different from choosing a form for an ongoing operation and saying, we're out of it and we're now going to try to distribute the assets in the way that will best protect the beneficiaries.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="m_miller_baker" startTime="168.510" stopTime="219.276">
            <label>Mr. M. Miller Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="168.510" offset="824948">Justice... Justice Ginsburg, that's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.128" offset="839472">The answer to that question is that a decision to terminate a plan or a decision to merge a plan requires that a plan sponsor consider as a threshold matter several factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.769" offset="885970">First, what will the plan form be of the acquiring plan?</text>
            <text syncTime="187.387" offset="900494">And PACE's proposal would have required the merger into a multiemployer plan as opposed to a single employer plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.708" offset="929751">That goes to the form of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.477" offset="936857">PACE's proposal would have resulted in a new plan sponsor and a new plan administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.564" offset="961203">It would have resulted in a new dispute resolution mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.766" offset="973951">That goes to the content of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.635" offset="981474">And finally, most importantly, the PACE proposal would have gone to the level of benefits provided by the plan and the level of benefits, as this Court has repeatedly recognized is a decision that is a plan sponsor decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.276" offset="1028076">Well if you're correct and this was a sponsor decision, not a fiduciary decision, let me ask you when you're wearing, when the company is wearing its sponsor hat and says we're going to terminate this plan, does it have a duty to consider the best interests and the security of the employees, number one, when it picks an insurance company?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.372" offset="1116475">It can't pick some flaky insurance company if there is a much more solid insurance company, can it?</text>

            <label>Mr. M. Miller Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="247.009" offset="1138940">Justice Kennedy, it depends upon the function at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.795" offset="1150120">If the function is the selection of an insurance company to provide the annuity, that is a plan administrator function and it is subject to ERISA fiduciary duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.729" offset="1261820">But it is only in the context of the selection of the annuity that the plan sponsor, the plan administrator, must purchase after the plan sponsor has made that threshold decision to terminate the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.586" offset="1309258">There is that threshold decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.455" offset="1312707">And likewise, merger is a threshold decision that goes to the--</text>

            <text syncTime="294.657" offset="1329529">No, but that's I think our sticking point.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.459" offset="1340814">If the, if the plan sponsor decides to purchase an annuity, it's accepted I think by you and by everybody that there are two decisions being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.632" offset="1377490">Decision one is terminate the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.667" offset="1389611">Decision two, distribute the assets by purchasing an annuity that gives the beneficiaries what they should get.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.773" offset="1422003">And so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.640" offset="1425451">But when we come to the question of merger, you're saying there's only one decision, and I think that's where I'm having trouble with your argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.830" offset="1466307">When we come to the question of merger, it seems to me there are two decisions again.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.365" offset="1484383">The first decision is we're going to terminate the plan that we've got.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.353" offset="1508311">We have decided to merge... one possible decision as an alternative to annuities is to merge the plan with, with another one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.240" offset="4255871">An employer does not have a fiduciary duty to consider merger as a means of terminating a defined benefit pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.160" offset="4279590">First of all, just like the decision to terminate the plan, the decision to merge the plan is a sponsor function, because it's a choice to alter the design, composition and structure of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.535" offset="4317102">And because both the decision to terminate and the decision to merge are sponsor functions, the choice between the two is a sponsor function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.872" offset="4346463">The plan administrator has a duty to carry out the sponsor's decision to terminate the plan, not to revisit that decision by considering whether to merge the plan instead.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.987" offset="4634855">There are two reasons that I say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.803" offset="4642169">First, even in the case of a sponsor of a plan that's going out of business, and that isn't going to be participating in any merged plan, the merger still is a decision to alter the design and composition and structure of the plan, as this case illustrates for the reasons that Mr. Baker said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.103" offset="4735374">That it's going to change fundamentally the plan from a single employer plan to a multi-employer plan, that it's going to change the... who is the administrator, that it's going to increase the pool of participants, that it's going to affect the benefits, because the assets that were available to pay the benefits are now going to be available to pay benefits of other participants in the, in the successor plan, that the PBGC's guarantee of the benefits is going to be lower in a multi-employer plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.490" offset="4860867">So for all those reasons, it's going to change, still change the structure of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.126" offset="4879466">But in addition to that, the employer of... the sponsor of this plan that would either terminate, or possibly merge, has a legitimate interest in choosing termination rather than merger, because in a termination, the sponsor can obtain a reversion of the surplus assets, and still fully provide all the benefits of the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.843" offset="4986359">No, Your Honor, and that goes back to a confusion that I think was... was present before, that the decision about the distribution options at termination is a sponsor decision that the employer makes in the plan documents, because those distribution options are benefits under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.375" offset="5076429">And while Section 1341(b)(3)(A), in isolation, might appear to permit the plan administrator to choose which of those distribution options that are in the plan to make available, other provisions of ERISA and the tax code prohibit the plan from vesting that discretion in the plan administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.122" offset="5163469">So in other words, the way it works is when the employer sets up the plan, the employer provides for the forms of distribution that are going to be available at termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.113" offset="5211430">And those forms are just forms of benefits, optional ways of providing the accrued benefits to the participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.452" offset="5240791">And then the participants get to pick among those options at termination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.794" offset="6858085">It's notable that neither the Petitioner nor the Government in their arguments here has referred at all to the definition of fiduciary in ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.685" offset="6901657">But that is the beginning point of every one of this Court's decisions as to what is a fiduciary function and what is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.922" offset="6930600">The statute and I'm quoting from 29 U.S.C., Section 1002(21)(A), it's in the first page of the appendix to our brief, is that a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent that... and then it goes on and there are three subparts, two of which are relevant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.739" offset="7037911">One of them and I'm taking them out of order because I think subpart 3 is the simplest way to resolve this case,</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.559" offset="7069154">"to the extent that he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of the plan. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.451" offset="7108756">The other one that's relevant is subpart 1, which is "to the extent he has"...</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.903" offset="7130594">"he exercises any authority or control respecting disposition of its assets. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.973" offset="7154836">The reason that the plan administration subpart is the simplest way to resolve this case is that Congress in Section 1341 of 29 U.S. Code, and that's quoted just immediately below what I was just citing to the Court, specifically assigned to the plan administrator all of the decisions that must be made with respect to implementing the termination of a pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.278" offset="7284089">Throughout that section, everything that must be done is stated specifically to be done by the plan administrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="1938.278" offset="7904027">The implementation guidelines make very clear that you can't tease those apart and say no, we are only going to look at the final step and that's a termination and nothing else is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3524.557" offset="14249170">That's what PACE proposed, recognizing that the decision whether to merge the plan was a plan sponsor function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.711" offset="14277800">I'd like to turn now to the question of the, also the second stage issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.614" offset="14305386">Even, even if this was a two-stage transaction, which was not proposed, each stage of that transaction is a plan sponsor decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.089" offset="14343316">A plan sponsor has to make the decision whether to transfer assets and then a plan sponsor has to make the decision whether or not to then terminate the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.409" offset="14376543">Each separate stage is a plan sponsor function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.497" offset="14392948">In terms of the plan sponsor function changing because the company is going out of business, that simply cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.669" offset="14429624">A plan sponsor function depends upon what the function is, and it doesn't matter whether the business is going out of business or whether the business is an ongoing concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.458" offset="14468808">If anything, because it's going out of business, it's important to protect the, the discretion of a plan sponsor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.964" offset="14498796">In terms of the contextual argument it's very important to note that nowhere... that Section 1341 which governs standard termination does not cross-reference mergers and the Section 1412 governing mergers does not apply to terminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.474" offset="14564834">In fact the only place in the statute where the two words appear together is in Section 1058, in which the two procedures are actually compared to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.632" offset="14605480">There are some significant differences between termination and merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.567" offset="14621154">In a termination, there is a reversion to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.601" offset="14637350">There is also reversion to employees based upon their individual contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.422" offset="14656576">There is no similar reversion in a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.374" offset="14668383">That is why a merger simply cannot be a method of termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.326" offset="14680191">The two are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.028" offset="14687087">You might have a two-stage transaction but they are two separate transactions each of which is a plan sponsor function.</text>
