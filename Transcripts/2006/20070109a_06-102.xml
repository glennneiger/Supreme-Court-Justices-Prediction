            <label>Mr. Gregory Andrew Castanias</label>
            <text syncTime="11.246" offset="172332">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.979" offset="183303">This Court in Ruhrgas against Marathon encapsulated the relevant line of this Court's precedents in the rule that we suggest controls in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.538" offset="221546">What it said, it is hardly novel for a Federal court to choose among threshold grounds denying audience to a case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.643" offset="257909">Now this Court's cases extending through Steel Company and Ruhrgas and afterward, hold true to this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.203" offset="288211">Threshold non-merits issues may be decided by a Federal court before it determines its jurisdiction, in that term meant as subject matter and personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.856" offset="326768">This Court in this case should hold the forum non conveniens is another one of those threshold non-merits grounds for denying audience to a case that can be considered first before jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.021" offset="375460">Adopting that rule in this case will do three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.895" offset="390924">First, it will result in a rule that is most faithful to the Court's precedents in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.877" offset="410882">Second, it will respect the rule of Steel Company and forbid ultra vires judgments on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.390" offset="440870">There is no chance that a dismissal in forum non conveniens will exercise more power than is granted to the Federal courts by Article III or by Congress in statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.340" offset="476710">And finally, it will give the Federal courts the appropriate flexibility in appropriate cases to serve important interests such as economy, constitutional avoidance, and particularly relevant in this case, international comity.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="102.038" offset="535538">Just on the second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.661" offset="545987">I wanted... does the rule of the Federal district court in forum non conveniens where it dismisses a case for lack of a convenient form, does it have any ongoing consequences as the law of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="121.201" offset="612129">I know our Chick Kam Choo precedent where we said Federal court determination forum non conveniens is not binding in a state court, but supposing in this case that the parties went to San Francisco with a... and said we want to sue there.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.412" offset="684959">Would the San Francisco court, the United States District Court feel bound by the determination that this dispute is determined by Chinese law, and that the Chinese court is therefore the appropriate court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory Andrew Castanias</label>
            <text syncTime="154.828" offset="746712">Well, I think there are two components to your question, Justice Kennedy, and let me see if I can answer both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.920" offset="771058">The first is whether the determination that the Federal court in Philadelphia, for example, in this case, was an inconvenient forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.619" offset="805853">Would that determination be binding on the court in San Francisco?</text>
            <text syncTime="173.103" offset="819750">Our view would be probably not.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.306" offset="824557">It would be persuasive in that case, but the forum non conveniens--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="178.084" offset="839708">What about the ruling that this would be governed by Chinese law and that the Chinese court is the best forum to consider that?</text>
            <text syncTime="185.880" offset="870846">That too has no lat... has no effect beyond the court in Philadelphia?</text>

            <text syncTime="192.109" offset="895819">--Let me... that was the second part of your question that I was going to try to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.171" offset="915985">And with regard to that, I think that it would not have preclusive effect in the main... in the mine run of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.105" offset="951721">And the reason I think it wouldn't have preclusive effect is that it would be one factor in what this Court has described as a multifarious analysis under the forum non conveniens analysis at American Dredging, and so it would be hard to say that for issue preclusion, for example, that the choice of law determination in that case was necessary to the ruling dismissing the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.875" offset="1050882">Now one might imagine a case at the margins where that was the case and there might be a case for preclusive effect, but that's, I think, not likely to be presented by this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.704" offset="1194137">Well, I think I have seen cases, and I can't cite them to you as I stand here right now, where litigants have tried to go to a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.169" offset="1227992">Another Federal Court, I can't think of a single one.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="278.106" offset="1239799">You... you were urging that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do with the merits; but there is an argument that the existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_andrew_castanias" startTime="299.895" stopTime="348.905">
            <label>Mr. Gregory Andrew Castanias</label>
            <text syncTime="299.895" offset="1326944">In some cases, I suppose that could be true, Justice Ginsburg; but the point of our rule is that the only issue presented by this case is that of Federal court power.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.029" offset="1383473">There may be a case where it is appropriate in the district court's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.059" offset="1399564">In fact in Ruhrgas, you writing for the Court pointed out that the normal court order business is to determine subject matter jurisdiction first and then personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.758" offset="1442405">But the point of our application of that rule in this case is there may be some cases where it's appropriate, and this is a paradigmatic example of the sort of case where it would be appropriate to decide the forum non conveniens issue first, before personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.893" offset="1506875">I hope that satisfies... I hope that's an answer to your question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="348.905" stopTime="350.295">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="350.123" offset="1527878">Uh-huh.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_andrew_castanias" startTime="350.295" stopTime="520.039">
            <label>Mr. Gregory Andrew Castanias</label>
            <text syncTime="350.295" offset="1528505">With regard to the body of this Court's decisions, we cited in our briefs cases like Leroy against Great Western, which holds that a Federal court can decide venue before deciding personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.791" offset="1582526">In this case it's hardly different because again, as American Dredging pointed out, forum non conveniens is properly described as a supervening venue provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.816" offset="1630591">The Gold Law case which we cite in our reply brief, and the solicitor general relies on, says that Federal courts have the power to transfer a case before determining personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.390" offset="1672910">And grants even more analogous here are the extension in the Tenet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.965" offset="1699241">In the case of extension, extension documents have very similar, though different, moorings as the forum non conveniens doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.040" offset="1743545">And they're both discretionary decisions to decline to exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.054" offset="1759532">This Court pointed out, citing the Ellis case, and it pointed this out in the Steel Company, Ruhrgas and Tenet cases that extension can be decided first.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.002" offset="1799342">And again, applying that precedent to the case of forum non conveniens, it's... it really does follow that forum non conveniens can be decided first.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.155" offset="1847930">With regard to the Tenet case, that case is very close to a merits issue, perhaps even one might call it a merits issue, but it was so threshold that it was appropriate to decide the totten bar that was at issue in that case before jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.100" offset="1907698">Again, and with all of these lines of cases, deciding forum non conveniens first will have... will provide no chance of the Federal court going beyond its constitutionally and statutorily exercised powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.235" offset="1972273">Now, I'd like to leave the Court with one final thought about the way this, and the importance of applying this rule in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.481" offset="2013233">The complaint that Malaysia International Shipping makes against Sinochem is nothing more than a claim that Sinochem defrauded a Chinese court.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.163" offset="2060044">There is a term used in the complaint, a fraudulent misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.114" offset="2079793">The term negligent misrepresentation is also used.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.973" offset="2095257">But make no mistake about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.801" offset="2102572">The complaint in this case is that Sinochem made a misrepresentation to Chinese courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.440" offset="2125141">This is precisely the sort of interference with the Chinese court system which has proceeded to judgment, and judgment by the way on these issues in favor of Sinochem and against Malaysia International, that really cries out for the flexibility inherent in our rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.087" offset="2191701">Unless the Court has further questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="657.469" offset="2757200">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="668.075" offset="2799623">In Steel Company the Court held that it is impermissible to adjudicate the merits of a case over which the Court may lack jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.288" offset="2840479">But it is another thing entirely for the Court to decline to exercise jurisdiction that it might well possess.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.144" offset="2875901">In Ruhrgas clarified, in language that counsel has already quoted, that a court may choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.750" offset="2922399">Now, the dividing line between a threshold non-merits ground and a merits ground may in some cases be difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.120" offset="2959806">And the Court has... members of the Court have disagreed in some cases; but there is an easier set of cases and that is where the Court is declining to exercise jurisdiction and especially where as here, it is doing so in favor of litigation of the substantive dispute in another forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.408" offset="3048936">And this Court has... has decided already that it is permissible, for example, for a court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction before deciding a difficult question of whether it would possess subject matter jurisdiction over the supplemental claims at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.119" offset="3131796">Forum non conveniens is in the nature of an abstention extension doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.786" offset="3162516">In Gulf Oil, one of the first cases of this Court to describe the forum non conveniens doctrine and its factors, analogizes forum non conveniens to a Burford abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.500" offset="3217373">The Court even in Steel Company acknowledged that abstention on grounds of Younger, for example, would be permissible to decide before resolving a disputed question of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.917" offset="3270977">But the Gulf Oil case does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal presupposes that the forum is one in which there's personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.298" offset="3356554">And the Court said so in the course of rejecting an argument that because it was conceded that jurisdiction and venue were proper in the Southern District of New York, that the doctrine of forum non conveniens could not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.292" offset="3424472">The Court said that couldn't be so, because the doctrine of forum non conveniens presupposes the availability of two fora.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.696" offset="3458118">But the Court did not address the entirely separate question of whether the Court could assume that even I it had jurisdiction, it would not exercise it.</text>

            <text syncTime="860.261" offset="3568354">The only point of the doctrine is to get rid of the case where you... where you do have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.744" offset="3594372">And so you do not have to... but that doesn't mean that you must establish jurisdiction before you can exercise the doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1108.567" offset="4561634">It is in the nature of a discretionary determination, as Your Honor says, that... that different judges could reach different decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.721" offset="4590265">In the Parsons case, Parsons versus Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court emphasized there the question was whether a state court's forum non conveniens determination had preclusive effect on a Federal court's analysis of the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.668" offset="4650033">And this Court held that did it not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.276" offset="4660482">In large part because it's impossible to know that every factor would be the same or would be weighed the same by the second court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.054" offset="4695590">And so I think it would be open to the second court to, to reanalyze the issues; but even if it weren't, even if there were some preclusive effects, I don't think that that undermines our position, because it is, of course, equally true of other threshold determinations such as personal and subject matter jurisdiction that they may have issue-preclusive effects in subsequent litigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.949" offset="4803110">For example, a trial court could decide that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the amount in controversy is insufficient because under state law, the plaintiff would not be able to recover punitive damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.084" offset="4859639">That determination would be given issue-preclusive effect in a subsequent suit filed by the same plaintiff in another district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.888" offset="5102892">Our understanding of a conditional dismissal in this circumstance is that the dismissing court is explaining its understanding of the world, and that... and facts as they bear upon its analysis, such as is the defendant subject to jurisdiction in a foreign forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.049" offset="5199545">Oftentimes, the plaintiff... if I could answer... oftentime the plaintiff objects to dismissal because they can't sue the defendant in the foreign forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.717" offset="5250222">That understanding of fact is a condition of the dismissal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.950" offset="5415107">We believe that this Court should affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit based on three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.260" offset="5444364">We believe that personal jurisdiction is a requirement articulated in Gulf Oil versus Gilbert which remains before this judicially created doctrine may be evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.630" offset="5489817">Second, we believe that adopting the Third Circuit holding establishes a clear, bright line discrete rule that is easy to enforce and appropriate to evaluate at any other appellate level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.828" offset="5546660">And third, we argue that the nature of the doctrine of forum non conveniens itself presupposes jurisdiction before making a ruling to dismiss for some other convenient forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.385" offset="5596919">The analysis that has brought the case to this Court has included a divergence of opinions between various circuit courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.725" offset="5634222">In the briefing, all parties tend to agree that forum non conveniens is a non-merits-based ground for evaluating a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.987" offset="5667345">The Fifth Circuit has decided otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.142" offset="5679884">We, we express some issue with the fact that in looking at a forum non conveniens analysis, the Court necessarily, as the Government has conceded in its brief, takes a peek at the merits of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.996" offset="5735368">The other issue that arises is that if a court dismisses a case based on forum non conveniens, and then an appeal is sought, the appellate court always has the opportunity to evaluate both the subject matter jurisdiction and the personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.553" offset="5805585">The Seventh Circuit in the Intek versus--</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.660" offset="5818020">Engle case, came up with such a ruling recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.549" offset="5829514">They expressed support for the Second Circuit and the D.C. Circuit, saying that it is appropriate to be able to deal with non-threshold matters such as forum non conveniens without ascertaining jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.294" offset="5884475">In fact, the court acknowledged that they thought the dicta expressed in the Ruhrgas opinion would become the holding of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.900" offset="5914986">However, for judicial efficiency, it decided to go through the analysis to determine whether or not there was personal jurisdiction in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.162" offset="5955946">It went through subject matter of the case and personal jurisdiction, and it determined that there was no jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.290" offset="8536531">I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.822" offset="8538621">So how are you going to get a different result then when it goes back and the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal jurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the district court says, oh, yeah, same result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.958" offset="8591179">--But there is the possibility of a case happening, as it happened in the In Re Bridgestone case, which was a Seventh Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.172" offset="8623989">In that case the court dismissed for forum non conveniens and the... I believe it dealt with the country of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.825" offset="8654604">The parties had obtained a ruling in Mexico saying that the Mexican courts were not to take jurisdiction of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.244" offset="8676338">Under those circumstances the court was required to take back the case because it no longer had the alternate forum in which to adjudicate the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.647" offset="8717925">So I think that's the one example of the case that you raise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.866" offset="8730777">But we know that that's not going to happen here, because the Chinese court has adjudicated the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2158.252" offset="8760348">Not on this issue, Your Honor, and actually not on the bills of lading issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.141" offset="8771946">You did raise that point and there is still the potential of arbitration taking place under the various charter parties to adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the remaining parties in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.355" offset="8820743">So that matter is still open as well.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="2175.262" offset="8828371">We're dealing with, because it's a foreign nation, not the codified forum non conveniens that's in 1404 and 1406.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.507" offset="8869331">And you are treating this as it were counterpart to 1404, which is forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.410" offset="8904962">But 1406 is wrong venue and, as you know, in the Goldlaw case this Court said a court can transfer even though it lacks personal jurisdiction and is a place of improper venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.557" offset="8985628">Now, why isn't the forum non conveniens doctrine as applied to foreign nations a combination of 1404 and a 1406, and if it includes 1406 then you don't need your personal jurisdiction, you don't need venue, you just transfer it to a place where those conditions exist?</text>

            <label>Ms. Ann-Michele G. Higgins</label>
            <text syncTime="2238.656" offset="9081968">I think, Your Honor, in that case, it's... as the doctrine developed, the difference lies in the statutory framework of the 1404 versus the judicially created version of the forum non conveniens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.823" offset="9138601">I think you're correct that as forum non conveniens exists today, side by side with 1404, you certainly have the limited application that it will apply to only foreign nations or to a State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.473" offset="9197220">And that's what I thought was the benefit of creating a rule that's rather limited in scope, that will not touch many other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.048" offset="9235568">It can be discrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.095" offset="9239747">It can be applied easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.624" offset="9245808">And that comports with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.920" offset="9259078">We thought that was one of the reasons why a finding by this Court would be able to ease the administration of cases along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.338" offset="9292723">If the Court has no other questions, I certainly would urge that, based on precedent and logic and the terms of the doctrine of forum non conveniens itself, that the ruling of the Third Circuit be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.489" offset="9349357">Thank you.</text>
