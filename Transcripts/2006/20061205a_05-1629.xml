            <text syncTime="9.956" offset="192055">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.724" offset="207101">The Ninth Circuit held that the term theft offense, an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act, does not include aiding and abetting.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.781" offset="247330">That holding is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.298" offset="257361">Indeed, it is so clearly incorrect that even respondent does not defend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.369" offset="277632">Respondent's aiding and abetting argument is that his violation of the California vehicle theft statute is not a theft offense under the INA, not because the California statute covers aiding and abetting and the theft offense does not, as the Ninth Circuit held, but because the California statute covers a certain kind of aiding and abetting, so-called natural and probable consequences rule, and a theft offense does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.770" offset="387242">That theory is slightly narrower than the Ninth Circuit's but it is mistaken for many of the same reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.108" offset="412633">One of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit's holding is mistaken is that it would drastically limit the number of aliens who could be treated as aggravated felons based on a conviction obtained in any jurisdiction, because no jurisdiction distinguishes between principals and aiders and abetters and it is ordinarily not possible to prove that an alien in a particular case was not convicted as an aider and abettor.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.891" offset="511793">Respondent's theory would have the same effect when a conviction was obtained in any jurisdiction that obtains the natural and probable consequences rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.769" offset="587235">I had thought... and I guess I'm wrong... that if the natural and probable consequences theory were used to prove, let's say, ultimately the offense of assault, in what started out as a theft case, that there would have to be a separate charge of assault but that the theory of proof would be the natural and consequences extension of aiding and abetting so that there would at least be on the record a charge of assault.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.501" offset="2310167">And in Penuliar, the Ninth Circuit clearly held the reason this California statute was not a theft offense was that conviction under it is possible under an aiding and betting liability theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.760" offset="2363248">So insofar as the order relied on Penuliar, it was saying nothing more and nothing less than that respondent's conviction was not a theft offense because it is theoretically possible he was convicted as an aider and abettor and the definition of theft offense under the INA does not include aiding and abetting.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.555" offset="2434406">Now as I was saying, I think it's important for the Court to make clear what it means to say, that aiding and abetting is included in the aggravated felony definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.161" offset="2476828">And this... the type of argument that respondent raises here, I think is important to keep in mind, is not limited to the particular aspect of aiding and abetting law on which he relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.235" offset="2525103">There are a great many different formulations of the basic requirements of aiding and betting.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.157" offset="2552793">Not only that they... they vary not only from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but even within jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.895" offset="2579751">So in the next case, you could imagine an alien or removal case arguing that because some other requirement of aiding and abetting law in the jurisdiction in which he was convicted is broader than the more typical formulation, that even though he was clearly convicted of, for example, murder, and even though the elements of murder in that jurisdiction perfectly match up with the federal definition of murder in the immigration statute--</text>

            <text syncTime="1025.332" offset="4253468">So whatever grounds there are for criticizing it, it is the law in most places.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.323" offset="4301534">Taking account of minor variations in formulation of aiding and abetting standards among jurisdictions would not only have the consequence of drastically limiting the number of aliens who could be found to be aggravated felons, because of the difficulty of establishing that someone was convicted as a principal rather than an aider and abettor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.986" offset="4692117">But there's a very important difference insofar as that type of comparison was concerned between on the one hand a principal offense and on the other hand aiding and abetting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.611" offset="4738615">The two important differences are if you have a general definition of the principal offense, whether it's a theft offense or burglary, any reasonable framework would contemplate that in a great many cases you would be able to tell whether the alien before the court was convicted of that offense, of the Federal definition of that offense, simply by looking at the State statute of conviction; and if it matches it, that's the end of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.528" offset="4846344">If it's broader, in most cases you'd be able to look at the charging instrument and see whether that person was charged with something narrower than the whole range of conduct that's covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.119" offset="4892633">Under respondent's theory, if you were to apply that same approach to aiding and abetting you would never be able to look at the statute to see whether somebody was convicted under an aiding and abetting theory that matches the Federal definition because every statute includes aiding and abetting, so it's impossible to tell from the statute whether somebody was convicted as a principal or an aider and abettor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.221" offset="4993047">Then if you look at the charging instrument, that won't suffice either because the law everywhere as far as I'm aware is that somebody charged as a principal can be convicted as an aider and abettor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.492" offset="5034112">So the only cases in which you'd be able to establish that somebody was not convicted as an aider and abettor are the unusual cases where there happens to be something in the files of the criminal case that will explain in some admissible fashion whether the defendant was convicted as a principal or an aider and abettor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1268.057" offset="5224388">So it's ultimately a matter of Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.342" offset="5237553">The second reason why this is important is because if you were to apply that rule to aiding and abetting you would be saying, in effect, that in any jurisdiction that applies a broader rule of aiding and abetting every single crime in the criminal code would not qualify for aggravated felony status, because an aiding and betting statute runs with the entirety of the criminal code and is a potential theory of liability for every substantive criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.944" offset="5347999">So that would mean that in those, those broader aiding and abetting jurisdictions, nothing could ever be an aggravated felony unless the government could somehow search through the criminal files and find something to prove that in fact the defendant was not convicted under an aiding and abetting theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.958" offset="5944009">But I think it's critical to keep in mind that there are two very important limitations in the Federal definition of theft offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.231" offset="5981103">The first is that, as interpreted by the Board of Immigration Appeals, it does require an intent to deprive the owner of property, and a great many unauthorized use of vehicle statutes in the State don't have that element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.823" offset="6031467">That's one important limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.423" offset="6037841">The other is that many of these statutes are misdemeanor statutes, so somebody convicted of it would not be sentenced to more than a year in prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.221" offset="6337100">I would like to pick up on the point made by Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.506" offset="6354236">This case does not involve a conviction under California's car theft statute, which is Penal Code 487(d), which requires an intent to steal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.731" offset="6399166">Rather, it involves a conviction under California's Vehicle Code, which covers varied and less serious conduct including liability with or without the intent to steal and also expressly reaching accessories after the fact, which the Government concedes would make it broader than the generic definition of theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.560" offset="6482445">The question is whether a conviction under this statute is a theft offense and therefore an aggravated felony triggering the extremely serious consequences of automatic deportation from the United States, a permanent bar from the United States, and in the sentencing context a sentencing enhancement from 2 to 20 years for illegal reentry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.423" offset="6657883">Is he correct that you concede that merely because the statute extends to aiders and abettors that is not sufficient to take it out of the categorical treatment?</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.888" offset="6751715">However, that's not what the Ninth Circuit stated in either this case or in Penuliar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.608" offset="6778673">In Penuliar the Ninth Circuit stressed the extremely broad nature of California's aiding and abetting liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.196" offset="6805005">It cited a case, People v. Beeman, which refers to the specific natural and probable consequences doctrine under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.952" offset="6836038">So the Ninth Circuit was talking about the broad sweep of aiding and abetting liability under California law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.079" offset="8952479">First, there's a similar provision to--</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.547" offset="8962406">108.51 covering the taking or operating of an airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.935" offset="8979960">It is in the penal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.318" offset="8985498">It is 499(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.086" offset="8996574">It exactly mirrors the language of 108.51.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.071" offset="9012456">So presumably the Government would agree that the definition of accessory under California law in the penal code would cover 499(b) for the same reasons it would cover under 108.51.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.581" offset="9062507">Moreover, accessory under California law only has one meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.152" offset="9084763">In 1872 the California legislature passed the provision at issue, Section 32 and said accessory is defined to be accessory after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.043" offset="9132411">At the same time, the legislature passed other provisions which also used accessory in that consistent way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.898" offset="9171803">The California Supreme Court as early as 1898 stated that accessory means accessory after the fact and relatedly, accessory before the fact, the only other plausible meaning of the term, has no meaning under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.610" offset="9238677">So with all due respect to the Government, accessory in 108.51 means accessory after the fact and that alone makes a broad and generic definition of theft offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2696.216" offset="10937054">On round two, on the modified categorical approach as we're discussing here, the Government gets a second chance to... based on actual documents in the record to establish whether there's enough there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.124" offset="10984701">Here the Government relies on the charging document in an abstractive judgment, but the Government does not put in a plea colloquy, it does not put in plea allocution, it does not put in any other documents that would establish under Shepard that someone was necessarily convicted of the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.902" offset="13831839">--Well ultimately, Justice Kennedy, we don't think that Taylor controls on the question of what Congress's intent was under the INA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.407" offset="13869769">Ultimately Taylor was a question about Congress's intent in enacting the Armed Career Criminal Act, and every aspect of that decision was tied in some way to Congress's intent there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.548" offset="13922432">We think Congress's intent in enacting the aggravated felony provision of the INA has to be that it didn't intend that you would have these highly arcane comparisons of some general definition of aiding and abetting, which either would or wouldn't include the infinite variety of formulations of aiding and abetting.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.734" offset="14035176">It's the one I suggested when I was up here earlier, which is a holding by this Court that Congress intended to include aiding and abetting liability in the aggravated felony provision, and intended to cover whatever formulations were extant in 1988 when the provision was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.529" offset="14106334">The Court can leave open the possibility that if in some future case, some jurisdiction were to enact an extraordinarily far reaching theretofore unheard of formulation, for example, anybody who intentionally insists... assists... without regard to whether the person even knew about the principles of criminal conduct, could be held liable as an aider and abettor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.311" offset="14201420">In that circumstance, it might well be the case that a state, by adopting such a far reaching theory of aiding and abetting, would in effect forfeit the right to have any of the subsequent provisions in its criminal code treated as aggravated felonies unless the government in the immigration case could somehow prove that the alien wasn't convicted as an aider and abettor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.408" offset="14289818">I think that, the problem I guess that I have with your argument, is that the theory of Taylor and as carried forward in Shepard was that there was a concept of a generic offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.484" offset="14342167">And when aiding and abetting liability is extended in the natural and probable consequences theory, we face the fact that regardless of what the actual count is, even on your count, there isn't even a majority of states that do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.862" offset="14411653">And I have difficulty seeing how that can, therefore, form an element of a generic offense when it is... or a generic concept of the offense... when it is a minority view.</text>

            <text syncTime="3587.525" offset="14502246">And even if it's, you know, 20-20 or 18-18 among the states on this particular wrinkle in the law of aiding and abetting, we think it is frankly dispositive in this case, that it is the Federal rule, and my friend Mr. Meade has not disputed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.404" offset="14573821">We think it's just inconceivable that Congress would have intended that in a Federal criminal case if you're charged with murder, you can be convicted under a natural and probable consequences theory such that you could conceivably spend life in prison the same way a principal would, and yet you would not be subject to the same immigration consequences as somebody convicted of the principal offense of murder, and indeed, that you wouldn't even be able... the government wouldn't be able to--</text>
