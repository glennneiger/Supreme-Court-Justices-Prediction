            <text syncTime="9.272" offset="189706">I think the most important point that I can make today is that this is a case about the substantive requirements of antitrust law, and just as in Dura and in Blue Chip Stamps, the Court articulated the substantive requirements for pleading a claim under the securities law, and just as in Anza, it did so under RICO, so too in Associated General Contractors, in Trinko.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.423" offset="294405">And in the instant case, the Court is faced with the question of what a plaintiff needs to plead in order to state a claim and show an entitlement to relief under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.814" offset="343933">In that regard, I'd like to direct the Court's attention to paragraph 51 of the plaintiff's complaint in this case, which is at page 27 of the joint appendix, and which summarizes the grounds for plaintiffs' allegation that there is a contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.927" offset="432332">The complaint states, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="72.762" offset="443721">"in the absence of any meaningful competition among the defendants. "</text>

            <text syncTime="996.408" offset="4138271">The fundamental concern of the United States is that the decision of the Second Circuit can be read to hold that a Section 1 Sherman Act complaint will survive a motion to dismiss merely by alleging parallel action or inaction in attaching the bare assertion of an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.202" offset="4209429">Such a result fails to appreciate that parallel action or inaction is ubiquitous in our economy and often reflects beneficial competitive forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.045" offset="4272854">Well there are certain portions of the decision that talk about a plausibility requirement but when it turns to the specific area of a Section 1 complaint and a complaint alleged on parallel conduct, I agree with you, Justice Scalia, that that's the only interpretation I can draw from that passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.256" offset="4345684">The Court held that if you allege parallel action unless there are no set of facts that can be proved, and it's always possible to hypothesize an agreement, you cannot dismiss that complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1060.064" offset="4392913">Well, is that really what they... I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the, that the Court spoke of no set of facts, only on the assumption that there had been a pleading which did raise a plausible, possible inference of forbidden conduct, and I thought the Court was saying if the, if the plausibility criterion has been satisfied, then the only way that the defendant can get a dismissal is by showing that there is no set of facts which would actually support the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.789" offset="4551842">And I'm not sure that that can be done at the, at the, at the stage of simply pleading a dismissal as opposed to summary judgment or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.597" offset="4595101">But I thought the Court did not get to its no set of facts point until it had first assumed that there had been a, a pleading on the basis of which a plausible inference of forbidden conduct could be drawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.625" offset="4667199">Well, Justice Souter, I read that passage of the Second Circuit decision as not expressly referencing the plausibility requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.981" offset="4700635">There is language saying that the allegation needs to be plausible but when you get to this specific passage it says that if you allege parallel conduct a court cannot dismiss the claim unless there could be no set of facts that could be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.241" offset="4761657">But regardless, even if I am, your interpretation is potentially permissible interpretation, the fundamental concern of the United States is that this Court, having the case now, clarify that a Section 1 Sherman Act complaint should not be able to survive a motion to dismiss unless it alleges some facts beyond mere generic parallel action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.920" offset="5156315">If I can turn to, in... in deciding whether or not there is such a reasonably founded expectation, you do need to look to the substantive law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2196.908" offset="8940309">One could say, well, there's a reason to rob the getaway cars totally independent of the bank and without a conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.013" offset="13828759">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.263" offset="13829700">Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.613" offset="13831163">I have three quick points that I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.131" offset="13841194">First following up on Justice Ginsburg's point, the private plaintiffs do not have an authority to issue purely investigative complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.904" offset="13876302">The Department of Justice of course can issue civil investigative demands, but for private plaintiffs the price of admission even to discovery, particularly to the sort of massive discovery at issue here, is to establish some basis for thinking the plaintiff... the defendants have done something wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.948" offset="13952475">In that regard, in the Trinko case, the plaintiffs there specifically alleged that the defendants were engaged in actions against self interest by not cooperating with new entrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.892" offset="14012244">And what the Court did is it went behind that mere allegation, looked at the complaint, looked at facts concerning the industry, looked at the statute, regulatory rulings and said that's ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.550" offset="14066892">Of course it is in the self interest of the incumbents to not go out of their way to cooperate with new entrants to allow them to take business away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.757" offset="14107643">Now the flip side, the second half of the conspiracy that the plaintiffs alleged here is our failure to enter new markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.029" offset="14144737">And it's important to recognize that they are suggesting we should have relied upon a regulatory regime that we were successfully challenging in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.652" offset="14187264">We got it struck down three separate times, and it was simply not a viable business opportunity in light of those facts and there is no reason to suggest that it was anything but in the self interest of the defendants to decline to enter these markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.648" offset="14263228">Even conscious parallelism is not sufficient to state a claim under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.238" offset="14297605">And at best, that is what we have here, and as a consequence they failed to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.008" offset="14328743">If the Court has further questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.894" offset="14336266">I have nothing further.</text>
