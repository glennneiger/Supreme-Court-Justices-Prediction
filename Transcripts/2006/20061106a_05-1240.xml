            <text syncTime="7.263" offset="178817">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.137" offset="198252">This case presents the Court with the question it addressed in Heck versus Humphrey raised in a slightly different context.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.710" offset="240571">The context in Heck was of a prisoner whose conviction had been affirmed who was in prison, who had filed a civil rights case that would have had the practical effect of collaterally challenging his criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.517" offset="291771">The context in this case is of a civil rights plaintiff who has prevailed in his criminal case, who was imprisoned for 8-1/2 years fighting the criminal case and comes to Federal court with a Section 1983 action saying, I now seek a remedy for my unconstitutional incarceration, and files his lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.742" offset="392708">The court in Heck held that this action, an action to recover damages for unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, accrues when the conviction is set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.800" offset="436907">That's the principle that we asked the court of appeals to apply and the court of appeals said: We're not going to apply that because we will adopt a categorical rule without any implied exceptions whatsoever that says when you're arrested you have 2 years, which is the statute of limitations in 1983 cases in Illinois, to file your claim for damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="101.975" offset="557593">You say that this case should be just like Heck, but in Heck the core problem was the line between 1983 and habeas, right?</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>

            <text syncTime="128.433" offset="663441">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.261" offset="666785">In Heck the Court solves the core problem by concluding... by denying the existence of a cause of action for damages until the criminal case had been resolved in favor of the civil rights claimant, which is the rule, the common law rule for malicious prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.112" offset="742122">That's the solution that the Court came up with in Heck, which is the solution that the petitioner believes should be applied in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.532" offset="1071891">Well, is that... I mean, your friend on the other side says that the cause of action would have accrued at the moment at which he was bound over by the decision of an independent magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.058" offset="1117971">At that point the false arrest and the incarceration incident to the false arrest is over and if there is ever going to be a claim for what happens next, I gather it'ss going to be a common law action for false imprisonment, and that, I guess, would not accrue until the imprisonment is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.862" offset="1201145">But so far as the arrest is concerned, whatever whatever wrong is done, that wrong is completed at the point at which an independent magistrate takes over.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.526" offset="1283797">The core of the cause of action is that the respondent police officers exploited that arrest to get this untruthful confession that was used to hold Mr. Wallace in custody for 8-1/2 years, to seize him for 8-1/2 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.030" offset="10505857">But the main point that I would make is that a rule of delayed accrual wholly undermines the purposes of the statute of limitations, and where the plaintiff's interest, the claimant's interests, can be served, as I indicated, at a minimum every victim of a Fourth Amendment violation has the right to some damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2748.357" offset="11143140">And unlike the accrual question, as indicated a moment ago, the tolling is governed by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.932" offset="11169472">In this case, for example, because Mr. Wallace was only 15 years old at the time of the arrest, his claim was tolled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2782.531" offset="11279813">So there's all sorts of tolling available, or could be under state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.950" offset="12989475">The issue that has been sitting in this case like the elephant in the room is what is Mr. Wallace's cause of action?</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.789" offset="13048825">Is it a cause of action for being seized until he was arraigned?</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.896" offset="13069305">Or is it a cause of action for being seized for the eight and a half years that he was locked up until he was, the criminal case was resolved in his favor?</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.002" offset="13101697">My sister argues that it was just, the Federal remedy is only until you're being arraigned, and that the state remedy for malicious prosecution doesn't exist if the Seventh Circuit has construed Illinois law to say that there is no malicious prosecution when you win the Federal case, when you win the criminal case, because the evidence has been suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.072" offset="13182050">The false imprisonment, state false imprisonment was dismissed by the district court, under his reading of Illinois law that the cause of action accrued at the time of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.598" offset="13228130">Not at the time he was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.473" offset="13235653">And the Seventh Circuit when that issue was raised on appeal to them in a brief by both sides chose to reject it without discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.016" offset="13265746">What, the cause of action that respondent proposes is none, for the eight and a half year seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.904" offset="13297302">There is no state cause of action in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.591" offset="13304094">And there is no Federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.543" offset="13315901">It is just tough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.198" offset="13322484">You are seized for eight and a half years, and you can't go to state court, you can't go to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.556" offset="13339934">You should have sued immediately after you were arrested to get a little bit of damages, but that's all you can get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.444" offset="13363444">And have a nice day; we're sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.896" offset="13369296">That, I don't think is consistent with Heck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.083" offset="13386014">I don't think it is consistent with this Court's jurisprudence about the meaning of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.923" offset="13405449">I don't think it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment and it should not be the rule that the Court adopts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.968" offset="13429586">The statute of limitations problem isn't really a problem because all of the evidence that's material to the legality of the arrest, to the legality and the... whether the confession was the proximate... was proximately caused by the arrest or proximately caused by the incarceration, has been developed in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.272" offset="13514850">When there's very strong interest in seeing that the facts are fully determined and fairly determined for both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.552" offset="13543898">It is not that the police officer who sued eight... eight and a half years later is much less is much less prejudiced than Mr. Wallace is, who comes out of prison after eight and a half years with no remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.669" offset="13592381">The questions about the multiple causes of action that can arise: if you're beaten, you have to sue immediately after you're beaten; if you're beaten but a confession is extorted from you, your right to sue starts with the confession is used against you at trial... and if there's some constitutional violation which necessarily impairs the conviction, then you can sue after you successfully defended a criminal case... is really an administrative nightmare that really could be solved by a Federal tolling rule that all Section 1983 cases are tolled; the statute does not start to run until the criminal case has been resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.792" offset="13768865">In most cases, then, instead of being filed in district court--</text>
