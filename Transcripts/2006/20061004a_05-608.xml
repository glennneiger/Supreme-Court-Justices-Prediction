            <text syncTime="1679.988" offset="6871724">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.809" offset="6883009">I'd like to start with the fact that there are four counts in the complaint for declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.833" offset="6907041">The first one is styled as a... contractual relations claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.128" offset="6924282">The other three are styled as patent law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.520" offset="6937761">And it's important to emphasize, at the outset, that this Court, in Skelly Oil, in Calderone, and in, really, all of the cases, has said it's very important to look behind the labels that a Declaratory Judgment Act plaintiff puts on their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.438" offset="6993454">We need to actually see what is the cause of action they're trying to adjudicate so we can do an accurate assessment of justiciability... standing, ripeness, Federal-question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.095" offset="7040057">I want to start by explaining why there is no contract claim at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.820" offset="7058969">You heard today, they're trying to salvage this, say that there's a contract dispute, a dispute about the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.813" offset="7086973">They didn't argue that below, and with good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.675" offset="7098467">And I'd just point you to the briefs in the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.029" offset="7107871">Roman numeral I, which is all about the improper dismissal of the Declaratory Judgment Act claims, refers to the fact these are, quote, 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.518" offset="7157817">Nowhere do they say that there is a dispute about the proper interpretation of the contract terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.388" offset="7181327">And let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.981" offset="7187596">The contract terms, which were just read to you, is Section 110 of... 1.10 at JA-399 of the license... says that there is an obligation to pay royalties for Synagis on any claim... not any valid claim, any claim... that has not been held invalid by a court or other competent jurisdiction from which no appeal has, or may, be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.976" offset="7287593">Now, they never said, below,</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.140" offset="7296266">"That clause means that we can come to court and have the court decide whether this patent is valid, and, depending on whether we win or not, then we can stop paying. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.664" offset="7338375">And the reason they didn't make that argument is, it was rejected by this Court a hundred years ago, in United States versus Harvey Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.850" offset="7367110">Very similar clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.941" offset="7375469">The United States says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.193" offset="7380485">"This means that we don't have to pay if the patent is invalid. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.764" offset="7398770">And, in an opinion by Justice Holmes, this Court rejected it out of hand by... and said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.489" offset="7421654">"This was a conventional proviso. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.339" offset="7429072">"We don't even need to look to evidence of the party's intent, because this is the standard proviso. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.523" offset="7453836">"It does not mean. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.025" offset="7459792">--and they said it was a "twisted interpretation" that the Government was offering... it doesn't mean that the licensee, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.058" offset="7479959">"thought the patent bad and would like to have the Court say so now. "</text>
