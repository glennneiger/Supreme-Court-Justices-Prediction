            <text syncTime="11.974" offset="200453">In an effort to achieve its desired racial balance in its popular high schools, the Seattle school district denied over 300 children, both white and minority children, admission to their chosen schools solely because of their race and without any individualized consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.583" offset="266909">This strikes at the heart of the Equal Protection Clause which commands that Government treat people as individuals, not simply as members of a racial class.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.041" offset="308705">This fundamental equal protection principle was reiterated in Grutter and in Gratz.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.326" offset="329812">The central question in this case is not, as the school district and many of its allies suggest, whether integration is important or whether desegregation is compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.551" offset="374742">The central question in this case is whether outside of the remedial context, diversity defined as the school district does, as a white/nonwhite racial balance, can be a compelling interest that justifies the use of race discrimination in high school admissions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3498.673" offset="14147229">There were some questions of my friend Mr. Madden about the record and the statistics about enrollment, and I'd like to draw the Court's attention, particularly Justice Breyer and Justice Stevens' questions about what the schools look like now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.283" offset="14205639">If the Court looks at pages 6 and 7 of our reply brief, we provided the enrollment data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.155" offset="14233119">The information on page 7 comes from the school district website that provides enrollment data at the individual schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.558" offset="14258824">In 2005 and 2006, enrollment at the oversubscribed schools is now 54 percent non white, which is greater than it was under the district's--</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.972" offset="14340430">And therefore, what you would like to note is when you look at the ninth grade after they stopped using any racial criteria at all, what happened to those ninth grade classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.280" offset="14389645">Did they become more heavily separated or did they retain their diversity?</text>

            <text syncTime="3577.591" offset="14462893">So each of the four years they're represented in the aggregate shows the effect that I think Your Honor was asking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.245" offset="14489537">So, the record in this case shows the Seattle schools are richly diverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.899" offset="14508137">It's very important in our view that the Court not lose site of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.835" offset="14519839">We've talked about integration and segregation, but I urge the Court to take a look at the data the petitioners submit regarding the actual enrollment in those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.874" offset="14552022">A couple of other record citations I'd like to bring to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.743" offset="14567487">Justice Kennedy, I think, asked about considering race as a last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.694" offset="14583369">It's simply not the case that the school district looked at race as a last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.998" offset="14600506">And I would draw the Court's attention to the superintendent's testimony at joint appendix 224 and 25, where he said in essence, the reason we didn't consider race neutral plans is because we were interested in racial diversity.</text>
