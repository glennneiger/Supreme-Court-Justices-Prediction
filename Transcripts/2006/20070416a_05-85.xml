            <text syncTime="13.911" offset="206895">In 1988, the Government of British Columbia created Powerex to perform a variety of public functions including the marketing of surplus hydropower generated by development of the Province's natural resources pursuant to bilateral agreements with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.592" offset="277634">The Ninth Circuit, however, denied Powerex its rightful status as an organ of a foreign State entitled to remove this case from State court to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.360" offset="324655">Before addressing the appellate jurisdiction issue, I'd like to highlight briefly the two key errors by the Ninth Circuit in rejecting Powerex's organ status.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.756" offset="366242">First, the court articulated the wrong test for determining an entity's status as an organ of a foreign State.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.651" offset="401873">The factors the Ninth Circuit found dispositive are inconsistent with the FSIA; and second, the court overlooked crucial evidence of Powerex's public functions that are the best indication of its sovereign status.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.841" offset="462581">The British Columbia Government receives and distributes the proceeds from Powerex's operations, supervises Powerex through BC Hydro, subjects Powerex to provincial laws not applicable to private companies and grants Powerex special benefits including exemption from taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.912" offset="4398921">This Court has held that the courts of appeals have authority to decide whether a remand order was, in fact, one within the authority of 1447(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.497" offset="4437268">In fact, just this term in Osborn, the district court remanded the case on the basis of 1447(c) for purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.989" offset="4511247">One, it said no remand of a case of this type, and then it said no review of remands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.656" offset="4541863">So the Court was as clear as it could be that only when you have those conflicting signals does that court... does that case have any application.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.344" offset="4596615">Osborn concerned a particular kind of categorical exception from 1447(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.168" offset="4619917">Our argument is that as a categorical matter, the basis of remand in this case was not one within the scope of 1447(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.034" offset="4659414">That although the District Court termed the sovereign immunity of the defendant's jurisdictional, it was not jurisdictional in the relevant sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.420" offset="4692955">And this Court held precisely that in the Oliver American trading case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.813" offset="4714480">There, a case removed by Mexico was dismissed by the district court on the basis of its immunity and the district court certified that holding as a jurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.800" offset="4766411">Yet this Court looked beyond that label attached by the district court and held that sovereign immunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense because it does not limit the authority of the Federal courts qua Federal courts but rather is a general rule that would preclude suit in State court as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.765" offset="4846346">Likewise, under 1447(c) it is not a basis to remand that the defendant is immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.850" offset="4878633">When Congress authorized sovereign defendants to remove cases to Federal court to vindicate their immunity, it did not intend that when the district court upheld that immunity, it would be remanded to State court which would be free to disregard the Federal court's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1291.490" offset="5317177">What, what's notable is that Congress enacted 1447(e) at the same time that it amended 1447(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.416" offset="5352913">It provided in 1447(e) for an authority to remand in a particular instance where the court lost subject matter jurisdiction post-removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.332" offset="5396589">It had of course been the rule since this Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity, that post-removal events did not defeat the removal court's jurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit that 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.167" offset="5479972">And when Congress amended the language in 1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited, it at the same time... and added the language, or changed the language in the second sentence that raises problems for our argument; at the same time, it added 1447(e) to provide, as I said, a particular authority to remand based on post-removal events that would have been unnecessary if, as Respondents urge, 1447(c) was intended to confer general authority to remand on the basis of post-removal events.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.191" offset="6904064">There are two reasons, independent and sufficient reasons why there is in appellate jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.526" offset="6929350">The first most narrow and simple reason to vacate the decision below for lack of jurisdiction, is to follow this Court's precedents which accept the district court's remand order for what it is and what it says it is, a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 1447(c), unremovable under 1447(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.528" offset="7009389">That is a simple direct route to that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.261" offset="7024331">There is a second approach suggested by a lot of the briefing and some of the argument Your Honors have heard this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.945" offset="7055051">And I want to lay it out briefly for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.647" offset="7065814">And it is that, as the law professor amici have suggested, there is some amount of confusion in the lower courts, I might say with due respect, evasion of 1447(d) in the lower courts, by judge-made exceptions to 1447(d), created by some but not all of the courts of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.661" offset="7149928">And the Court could clear out some of this underbrush, mooting many of the issues that Mr. Frederick and the that Solicitor General have raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.698" offset="7194023">Thermtron after Carnegie Mellon, addressing the question Justice Kennedy raised in his concurring opinion, in Things Remembered versus Petrarca, Thermtron does not say what many of the lower courts think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.420" offset="7260896">Thermtron does not say what my adversaries say it does, because Thermtron has been partially overruled by Carnegie Mellon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.075" offset="7295587">The notion that the only proper remand is a 1447(c) remand is ancient history after Carnegie Mellon, and therefore the notion that the only remand covered by 1447(d) is a remand under 1447(c) is also ancient history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.998" offset="7371237">Congress has given us a simple and strong message, which is when we're disputing the forum, when the parties in a case are legitimately and in good faith disputing forum, State court versus Federal court, Congress has said take one shot at it, let an Article III judge determine whether the forum is State court or Federal court, and move on to the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.010" offset="11743299">We did ask for a jury trial in our case and we were upset about the whole notion of this case being removed on a cross-claim we were not involved in... we never sued Powerex... losing our right to a jury trial on this important case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.098" offset="11791678">Mr. Frederick's reply brief says at footnote 4, page 3... or footnote 3, page 4; I apologize... that our right to jury trial is not threatened here and that under certain lower court decisions, which he is correct they do exist... I'm not sure they're unanimous... Our right to jury trial would survive even though he would have a right to a bench trial under his theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.984" offset="11887182">Well, there is no right to a jury trial on the cross claim against Mr. Frederick's client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.879" offset="11914767">The cross claim in the California court, which got this whole ball of wax rolling, is a cross claim for equitable indemnification and declaratory relief, equitable claims as to which there is no right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.759" offset="11978297">So I think we are all now in agreement on a jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.540" offset="12417363">Which means that Judge Whaley was correct when he decided that by concluding he had an immune party in front of him, he had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.356" offset="12456651">And it was equally correct for Bonneville, when he determined that United States versus Myers says the same thing, so that he had no subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.933" offset="12494999">And in addition, there was a derivative jurisdiction doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.684" offset="12505970">This notion of "removal jurisdiction" quote unquote, it's a term we all use.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.112" offset="13187662">And we of course have the Steele case which says jurisdiction has many meanings and we often get confused about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.387" offset="13212844">And the Court answered the question by saying, only when the trial court is patently wrong, patently wrong not about the jurisdictional question but as to whether it is even a jurisdictional question, only when the court is patently wrong do we second guess the court.</text>
