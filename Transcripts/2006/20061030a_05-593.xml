            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149207">We'll hear argument first this morning in Osborn v. Haley.</text>

            <text syncTime="6.037" offset="173344">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.026" offset="185256">The court of appeals misinterpreted the Westfall Act in a way that unfairly deprives tort plaintiffs of the most basic procedural protections routinely afforded in both Federal and State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.775" offset="228306">That misinterpretation cannot be reconciled with the text and history of the statute, the nature and operation of official immunity or the jurisdictional limitations of article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.572" offset="275431">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed and this State law case should be remanded to the State courts where it rightfully belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.616" offset="307614">In the alternative, the court of appeals judgment should be vacated for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.000" offset="329138">Prior to the Westfall Act, courts considered whether, assuming the alleged acts occurred, the Federal employee was acting within the scope of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.858" offset="376577">In Westfall v. Erwin, this Court added the additional requirement that the acts be undertaken with a discretionary function, but invited Congress to address the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.306" offset="426418">In responding with the Westfall Act, Congress did not change the basic rule that scope of employment sets the line for immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.983" offset="465080">Indeed, Congress confirmed that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.775" offset="476260">In particular, Congress gave no hint that it was radically rewriting the rules to direct Federal district courts to determine the merits of wholly State law claims in some sort of unprecedented summary proceeding.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="95.974" offset="533103">Why is it a wholly State law claim if the principal matter is whether this Federal employee is immune from suit?</text>
            <text syncTime="105.370" offset="570614">That's the threshold question that has to be answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.153" offset="585765">It's determined wholly by Federal law, so you must get through that Federal law gateway before you can go any place else in the suit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="118.108" offset="621605">Your Honor, that is true in perhaps a majority of Westfall Act cases, but in cases like this and a significant and recurring subset of cases there is no Federal law question because scope of employment simply is not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.089" offset="685553">What the Government does in those subset of cases is merely to assert the defense of he didn't do it or it never happened.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="144.205" stopTime="171.683">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="144.205" offset="725991">But that... it's not it never happened as though the Federal employee was off in Hong Kong.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.102" offset="769563">He was there on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.824" offset="780430">He is claiming that whatever he did was within the scope of his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.070" offset="809478">It seems like it's a question of phraseology that you're dealing with.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="171.683" offset="835914">With respect, Your Honor, that is not the case, certainly in this case and in others.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.308" offset="862350">The Government has conceded that if Respondent Barry Haley acted as alleged in the complaint he was acting outside the course and scope of his Federal employment.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="188.777" stopTime="203.476">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="188.777" offset="904250">But I think Justice Ginsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that the Government is entitled to say that during the time the event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and he refrained from committing any unlawful act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_grant" startTime="203.476" stopTime="233.055">
            <label>Mr. Eric Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="203.476" offset="963078">Your Honor, there may be cases where even if the acts occurred, they were within the course and scope of the Federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.772" offset="1008218">But in the case like this, as in Wood versus United States, as in Melo v. Hafer in the Third Circuit, the Government concedes, because the law and the facts require the Government and the employee to concede, that if the alleged acts took place they were necessarily outside the scope of employment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="233.055" stopTime="252.096">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="233.055" offset="1081360">But the actual statutory language refers to acting within the scope of employment at the time of the incident, and so a certification based on the view that at the time of the alleged incident, he was acting entirely within his scope would seem to be within the language of the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_grant" startTime="252.096" stopTime="280.826">
            <label>Mr. Eric Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="252.096" offset="1157534">Your Honor, on its face the certification in this case, as in others, tracks the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.333" offset="1194523">But when the Government's position was examined in the district court, it became apparent that the Government's essential defense, in fact supported by two declarations, including the declaration of Respondent Haley, was that he simply did not do the acts alleged.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="280.826" stopTime="302.248">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="280.826" offset="1272472">Well, but the question is what the district court should examine, and the statute talks about the incident out of which the claim arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.833" offset="1316463">So that necessarily requires the Government to look at the complaint, see the incident out of which this claim arises, whether or not the claim is true, and to certify it.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.920" offset="1368812">it seems to me is of some importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.462" offset="1374977">But the dissenting judges in the First Circuit case, Wood, didn't think it was important.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.257" offset="1402144">I'm not sure they were right about that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="315.698" offset="1411966">--Your Honor, this Court has consistently made a distinction between immunity and the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.204" offset="1441955">Starting in cases like Mitchell versus Forsyth in 1985 and continuing through cases like Richardson versus McKnight in 1997, the Court has consistently recognized that immunity is different from a defense on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.145" offset="1509769">It's different from a defense of he didn't do it or it never happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.977" offset="1529099">And I would say that, although the time of the incident is important, that is only one of several factors certainly under Kentucky law in determining whether something happened within the course and scope of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.362" offset="1606631">You assert he didn't do it versus something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.682" offset="1623871">But it's easy, let's say it's an assault case and the person says, you hit me, and the person says, well, it was entirely an accident; I was gesticulating with my hand so it wasn't, wouldn't have met the requirements for the tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.485" offset="1695134">Now, are they denying the incident in that case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Grant</label>
            <text syncTime="389.259" offset="1706209">Your Honor, the Court in Wood v. United States took account of the possibilities of artful pleading and would allow the Government to challenge the characterization of the incident.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="403.718" stopTime="418.845">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="403.718" offset="1763992">But it's not just a characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.398" offset="1770784">If it's something that has, for example, a mental element, the plaintiff can assert, you did that with malice aforethought and the defendant can say, no, I didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.435" offset="1810908">Now, is that a characterization or is that a denial of the incident?</text>

            <text syncTime="472.263" offset="2038174">Secondarily, as you said, the Government in effect elaborated on that and said the reason he was not acting outside the scope of his employment is that these acts which would have been outside scope didn't happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.710" offset="7083986">Well if anything the language of the Westfall Act is broader because as Your Honor emphasized earlier, the statute, the Westfall act provides that the Attorney General is to certify that at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose the employee was acting within the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.620" offset="7151591">So arguably the necessary question is what was the employee doing at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.113" offset="7173638">The Federal Officer Removal statute is somewhat narrower because it requires that the claim arise out of the, the acts taken under color of office.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.475" offset="7739032">And that view would certainly be inconsistent; it would create the anomaly that the Attorney General's authority to certify scope and to assert the immunity on behalf of the employee would be narrower than the employee's own authority to assert the immunity, because again going back to the Willingham case, the Court never asked whether it would be within the scope of employment for the prison officials to have maliciously tortured the prisoner; rather the defense was we didn't harm the prisoner but anything that happened between us and the prisoner happened within the scope of our employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.251" offset="7886154">And so the Attorney General's authority to certify has to be at least as broad as that in our view.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.113" offset="12965612">And we have two arguments that both the issues, substitution and remand, are appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.077" offset="12989436">One is a very specific one and that is that Congress has categorically taken this kind of remand outside the court's authority under 1447(c) by specifically prohibiting remand at all in 2679(d)(2), and that argument of course would not have relevance, I don't think, much beyond this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.513" offset="13083163">And this Court has recognized that Congress can exempt a certain class of orders from the scope of 47(c) and (d) without cross-referencing those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.882" offset="13136662">In the Rice case, the Court said that that specific removal provision did not purport to impair or restrict the application of the then equivalents of 747(c) and (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.951" offset="13196952">But clearly 2679(d)(2) does purport to impair the authority to remand by making the certification conclusive for purposes of removal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.434" offset="13398931">The statute said, for purposes of removal, the certification is conclusive, and that allows for the kind of dichotomy that you and I were talking with before.</text>

            <text syncTime="3341.823" offset="13516482">If that's the case, then under 1447(d), there could be a review of it because it was not a jurisdictional ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.550" offset="13555352">But if on the contrary, the judge said, as I think the judge said here, I am remanding because based on this analysis, I do not have jurisdiction, i.e., the judge went against the statute saying that jurisdiction is conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.130" offset="13617628">That is an erroneous jurisdictional ruling, and as Justice Scalia said, we have said over and over again, however erroneous it may be, it is not reviewable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.711" offset="14164005">There has to be an admission under the facts and the law, that even if the alleged acts occurred, it was outside the scope of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.300" offset="14218340">And I think for this Court to say otherwise in this case would require overruling, or being contradictory to over 20 years of official immunity jurisprudence, where the Court has consistently distinguished between immunity defenses and defenses on the merits, where certainly the lower courts have taken that conceptual distinction and said a defense that the alleged acts did not occur do not raise an immunity defense.</text>
