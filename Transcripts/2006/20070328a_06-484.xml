            <text syncTime="8.986" offset="188403">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.550" offset="198643">In 1995 Congress acted decisively to curb abusive private securities litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.193" offset="225184">It took the extraordinary step of rejecting categorically the traditional rule of notice pleading in complaints that are filed under the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.338" offset="261755">Instead it declared that, and this is at page 2 of our petition,</text>
            <text syncTime="30.961" offset="276279">"The complaint shall state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind. "</text>
            <text syncTime="40.528" offset="314523">The fundamental error in the court of appeals analysis in this case was in writing out of the statute the strong inference language that Congress clearly intended to be not only in those statutes, but obviously applied rigorously.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="53.646" stopTime="76.990">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="53.646" offset="366977">At some point during your argument... and I know you only have 20 minutes... will you tell me whether or not in your view the pleading standard that the judge must follow is equivalent, is the same as the instruction that's given to the jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="71.718" offset="439283">Because if it isn't, then the Seventh Amendment argument may have some more force.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="76.990" offset="460390">I think the answer to the question is that it does not have to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.433" offset="474183">I think Congress actually has greater authority in dealing with pleadings that is distinct from the Seventh Amendment right, but the Court doesn't need to go that far in this particular case because I think the inferences that we are asking the Court to draw from the record in this case would avoid any--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="96.485" stopTime="105.020">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="96.485" offset="538340">Well, in writing... I take it, so far as the jury, it's just whether it's more likely than not, preponderance of the evidence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="105.020" stopTime="107.912">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="105.020" offset="572508">--That's what the Court held... held in Huddleston, yes, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="107.912" stopTime="124.061">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="107.912" offset="584106">So your submission is, maybe not in this case, but insofar as your theory of the case, that the trial judge can, and in fact must basically apply a standard of fact... standard of proof that's higher than that what the jury would.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="124.061" stopTime="174.266">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="124.061" offset="648681">Well, it's important as a standard of allegation, because what we're talking about here is an analysis of the allegations of the lawyers, and not any kind of an evidentiary showing by any of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.231" offset="693298">So I do think it's removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.660" offset="699045">I mean, this Court has really never addressed the issue of the extent to which the Seventh Amendment extends to pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.436" offset="722137">And I don't think this is the case in which to take up that issue because I think it is quite clear that what at least we're asking for as the appropriate interpretation of the Reform Act is that you need to apply... that you simply follow Matushita and Monsanto, and that is to force the plaintiffs to demonstrate that innocent explanations can be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.518" offset="810431">And if you take that particular approach, which clearly is consistent with the Seventh Amendment, then it seems to me you... the Seventh that you followed under the Constitution, is eliminated.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="174.266" stopTime="200.363">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="174.266" offset="849510">Mr. Phillips, the Seventh Amendment or not, the question in 12(b)(6) is has the plaintiff stated a claim, and at the end of the line it's has the plaintiff proved a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.083" offset="900710">But you're stating two different claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.616" offset="914921">The claim that must be stated is a stronger claim than the claim that must be proved, and I don't know of any other instance where that is so.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="200.363" stopTime="220.826">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="200.363" offset="953896">I don't know that there are any other instances in which that's true, Justice Ginsburg, but I don't think it's a constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.766" offset="983466">I think at the end of the day the question is, does Congress have the power to enforce its view of the appropriate way to proceed as a matter of policy at the pleadings stage, and I think the answer to that question is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.045" offset="1032577">But again, you don't have to--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="220.826" stopTime="261.072">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="220.826" offset="1035711">I wasn't asking it as a matter of constitutional law but I'm thinking, how do you construe these words, what is it, "strong inference"?</text>
            <text syncTime="233.225" offset="1085344">And the words come out of, as I understand it, a Second Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.309" offset="1109690">So I would think the most logical thing is that you'd look at the Second Circuit decision and say ah, Congress picked up those words from the Second Circuit decision, then we should pick up the standards that the Second Circuit applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.527" offset="1166532">But your definition of strong inference is quite different from what the Second Circuit's was.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="261.072" offset="1196730">--Well, I'm not sure that's 100 percent true.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.345" offset="1205821">I think the real problem with the Second Circuit is there's no monolithic Second Circuit rule that's out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.238" offset="1229331">The Second Circuit applied a number of cases under its particularity standards under 9(b) prior to the time Congress adopted the strong inference standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.653" offset="1267052">Some of them... I think we would be very comfortable with the analysis in Shields versus Citytrust Bank, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.499" offset="1294428">The way Judge Jacobs analyzed the complaint in that case is precisely the way we're trying to analyze the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.315" offset="1317625">So if you--</text>

            <text syncTime="292.264" offset="1321491">One of the amicus briefs talks in terms of the percentages, how likely the inference, the word strong inference means 50 percent, 30 percent, 60 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.290" offset="1357540">Do you think the inference has to be stronger or less strong than the inference of probable cause in an affidavit for a search warrant to get access to the privacy of a home and so forth?</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.185" offset="13709174">And in the first instance, it seems to me quite clear that the Seventh Circuit did not apply the strong inference standard.</text>
