            <text syncTime="12.011" offset="200856">This case is properly before this Court, which should reverse under the plain language and purpose of the Organic Act of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.587" offset="235233">As to jurisdiction, at the time Congress amended the Organic Act to replace the certiorari jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit with direct review in this Court, the Ninth Circuit had already granted the writ of certiorari that had been timely filed and the case had been briefed, argued and submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.546" offset="323004">The amendment said nothing about its application to pending appeals, and someone had to decide whether and how it applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.494" offset="366786">The Ninth Circuit was the proper body to do that, at least in the first instance, and until it did, this case was before that Court within the meaning of Gibbs versus Wynn.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="79.656" offset="471484">Well, for reasons that we articulate, Your Honor, in a... I forget the footnote number, but a footnote in our brief, there are some important distinctions, although they turned out not to be dispositive, between the nature and position of this case and Santos.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.370" offset="526342">But in any event, we know from the Ninth Circuit that it did not consider it otherwise, because if the Court will refer to I believe it's page 50a or 51a of the joint appendix, after the Court decided Santos, it sua sponte issued an order in this case... it is on page 51a... resubmitting this case effective February 1 to the Ninth Circuit's active consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.357" offset="638250">And shortly thereafter, it filed the order in this case from that... in our view, triggered the 2101(c) 90-day period.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="131.198" offset="677643">Are you suggesting that the test is whether under colorable jurisdiction... a hypothetical case, suppose the statute, Federal statute is very clear that it applies in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.757" offset="719857">Would your argument be the same?</text>

            <text syncTime="143.100" offset="725290">Well, I wouldn't have the most, the strongest argument that I have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.128" offset="745352">I think... now, the Court's cases are not clear here but it does seem to me that in the instance as here, where it isn't just that a party has made some application or filed a cert petition with a court, but the court has actually reached out and asserted jurisdiction, surely anything other than an amendment withdrawing... that an active withdrawing... withdrawing jurisdiction that requires anything other than merely a ministerial act, where there can be no possible confusion about what Congress intended to do, certainly anything short of that, it lies with the Court to ascertain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.969" offset="920686">And here--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="192.344" stopTime="210.306">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="192.344" offset="922253">But if we accept that in the opinion, what was the phrase you used, colorable jurisdiction, or... it's something I made up, I suppose... is there some concept that we can refer to or some phrase that works to... in order to incorporate your test that you seem to be suggesting?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="210.306" stopTime="284.011">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="210.306" offset="994038">--I actually would not embrace that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.805" offset="1004069">I think that in an instance, Your Honor, where a court in which, properly had jurisdiction and affirmatively asserted it and issued... and I can take the Court through this... a series of orders of the Court, following this 19, the October 19, 2004 enactment leading up to the decision in Santos and thereafter, which the Court continued to rule, continued to issue orders in this case, I think a good argument can be made that on a theory of constitutional avoidance the court ought to construe any enactment of Congress, no matter how pellucid it is, as not constituting a self-effecting reversal of a preexisting order of the Court in which the case had been pending per order of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.893" offset="1224438">And so I'm not sure that I would even embrace a ministerial test concept in the context in which a case is properly pending in front of a court which has affirmatively asserted jurisdiction over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.355" offset="1286296">And indeed here--</text>

            <text syncTime="284.011" offset="1288908">Mr. Waxman, may I just ask this question?</text>
            <text syncTime="286.730" offset="1299775">I don't understand what the import of this order on page 51 is.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.194" offset="1325584">I have it in front of me.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.522" offset="1330913">What did that do?</text>

            <text syncTime="302.037" offset="1361006">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.787" offset="1364036">And I think you should... well, I suppose you could start anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.784" offset="1380023">But let's, maybe it would be as well to start on 49a of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.297" offset="1410012">In December 15... remember, the Guam Organic Act was amended I believe October 30, 19... or 2004, and it was silent as to its effect on cases that had already been filed and were pending in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.977" offset="1480751">Sua sponte, the Court... well, actually it was not sua sponte.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.663" offset="1495484">Almost two months after Congress enacted the Organic Act, the respondent in this case, Governor Camacho filed a motion on December 8 with the Court renewing a previous motion for the Court to expedite its resolution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.532" offset="1566955">And Governor Camacho's affidavit in support of that motion is included in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.200" offset="1593600">In response to the motion, not telling the Court hey, by the way, it's been nice doing business with you but we have no further truck with your court because Congress passed the statute and you are ipso facto by operation of law no longer in business, the Ninth Circuit issued the order on page 49a that says no opinion in this case can issue until the case of Santos is decided clarifying our continuing certiorari jurisdiction over decisions from the Guam Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.248" offset="1733826">Then turn to page 50a of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.481" offset="1750753">A week later, on December 22, the Court sua sponte issues an order withdrawing and deferring a ruling in this case pending the decision in Santos.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.506" offset="1806864">Santos is then decided in January.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.630" offset="1819403">And on February 1, the Court issues an order in this pending case saying okay, it's resubmitted to the panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.830" offset="1856183">And shortly thereafter, the panel issued the order dismissing this case for lack of jurisdiction, and from that date we filed a timely petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.950" offset="1904666">Now the contention of the respondent in this case that the attorney general should immediately upon enactment of the Organic Act amendment have also filed a petition with this Court would do one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.223" offset="1969764">It either would have put this Court in the position of determining the effect of the amendment at the very same time that the Ninth Circuit was doing so, which is a state of affairs that this Court has repeatedly rejected, most notably in Andrews versus Virginia Railway, or it would have amounted to nothing more than what this Court has called, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="488.585" offset="2107168">The attorney... there were two cases in which the Guam Supreme Court issued a final... its own final ruling after the October 30, 2004 amendment of the Organic Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.203" offset="2189610">He filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.061" offset="2205075">There were two cases that were pending in the Ninth Circuit and over which the Ninth Circuit had granted the writ, this case and Santos.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.666" offset="2239556">In Santos, but not in this case, the Court asked the parties to file supplemental briefs with respect to the Court's continued jurisdiction, and the attorney general did so in this case, and it's discussed in our reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.425" offset="2302564">Mr. Waxman, going back to what you just said, isn't a third possibility, the most likely possibility, that this Court would simply hold the petition if there were... if the attorney general filed a cert petition here while the Ninth Circuit had not yet disposed of the case, this Court could have just held it because the Ninth Circuit was likely soon to dispose of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.815" offset="2456059">This Court has said uniformly outside the special context of three-judge courts that it will not require the mere filing of a redundant piece of paper, to quote the Colville Indian Reservation case, and it has declined to extend this well, why don't you just file a notice of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.088" offset="2557205">There's no sense in which it's redundant, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.398" offset="2570475">It would have been the first piece of paper that this Court would have seen in the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.317" offset="2586149">But that is actually what this Court was referring to in the Colville Indian Reservation case and other cases in calling it redundant in the sense that it was identical or effectively identical to a piece of paper that had invoked the jurisdiction of another court at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.763" offset="2667860">In the three-judge court context, Justice Ginsburg, although this Court's jurisdiction to hear direct appeals in three-judge courts has been greatly reduced since the 1950s and sixties and early seventies, there are certain instances that this Court has realized where it is unclear whether an appeal lies to a regional court of appeals or to this Court and it is unavoidable there that you would file a notice of appeal in both instances; but this is not a situation in which there was any uncertainty about where the petition for a writ of certiorari from the Guam Supreme Court's decision had to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.901" offset="2844448">The Organic Act said the Ninth Circuit had certiorari jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.144" offset="6325421">I'm not... our argument is that the word "tax valuation" has to have meaning; and the plainest meaning is the meaning, we respectfully submit, the most natural meaning of "tax valuation" is the valuation that is used by Guam for the calculation of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.571" offset="6415177">And that's true not only as a matter of plain language, but for three other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.475" offset="6438792">First of all, as I indicated, it puts Guam in harmony with the regime that has existed in every other U.S. territory in which the value of property against which the debt limitation rate is assessed is the same as the value of property against which the tax rate is assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.124" offset="6517368">And secondly, or thirdly, that fully accords with the statutory and legislative history both with respect to the territories and the states that reflects that it has always been understood that tax valuation and assessed valuation are equivalent in this context, and understanding that furthers Congress's consistent goal of restraining borrowing by territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.769" offset="6631889">And finally, interpreting tax to mean full renders the word tax all but meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.297" offset="6666057">I grant you, Justice Kennedy, that it is possible to come up with a meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.279" offset="6681940">It is not a meaning that the Guam Supreme Court adopted but it is a possible meaning; but the Guam Supreme Court interprets... actually said in its opinion, tax has to mean something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.805" offset="6728020">It interpreted tax not to modify valuation, the word that follows it, but to modify the word "property", and to read it as taxable property, which is with all respect plainly wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.595" offset="7107213">On the other hand, in the Philippines, it is clear from 1902 on that a system of fractional valuation was in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.701" offset="7143680">Now, getting... figuring out what actually happened in the Philippines way back when, when it was a territory of the United States, has been challenging and its may very well be that there is information; but simply, simply obtaining for example, the... the three unpublished hearings with respect to the Virgin Islands legislation in 1949 has been actually surprisingly... surprisingly challenging.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.591" offset="7295191">This case should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction because the certiorari petition filed in this Court to review the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court was untimely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.115" offset="7373349">There are three principal reasons supporting both of these positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.628" offset="7391321">First, on the dismissal: Dismissal is required, one, because when the Ninth Circuit was divested of authority to adjudicate the merits of the case, on October 30th, 2004, this Court was then the only court that could review that judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.708" offset="7531651">There is a case lodged in the court, and that court will follow Congress's directions and dismiss it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3617.697" offset="14623582">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.477" offset="14630792">I want to direct the Court... in response to two questions that were asked of Ms. Brinkmann, I want to direct the court to two pages of the Guam Supreme Court's opinion, and I'm going to summarize them for you now, but for purposes of what's the difference between in terms of bond holders, the fact that certain property isn't taxed at all and certain property is only taxed at 35 percent, what's important to note here, and that is reflected at page 26a of the petition appendix, the tax roll on Guam includes a valuation of all nontaxable property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.507" offset="14786900">The Guam Supreme Court then has to go back and say, well, of this approximately 183 million is exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.754" offset="14819814">So in Guam, the tax assessor and the Guam courts are treating property that is wholly exempt from taxation the same way that it treats the two-thirds of fair market value that is exempt from application of the tax rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.202" offset="14885643">Secondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's questions about why are we focusing... why wouldn't bond holders focus on assessed valuation rather than the rest and what difference does all of this make, page 18a of the joint appendix, which is footnote 8 of the Guam Supreme Court's opinion, which comes in the... the portion of the opinion where the court says, look, "tax" has to mean something; we think it means taxable property, not tax valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.423" offset="15002567">The Guam Supreme Court in its opinion in footnote 8, quoting from some language from a dissenting opinion in the Hawaii Supreme Court, says as follows, and I'm quoting from footnote 8:</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.591" offset="15051259">"It has been argued that the use of a percentage of assessed value as a measure of the State debt limit is without significance. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.712" offset="15095667">now skipping the rest of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.756" offset="15103817">"The people that buy the bonds are interested in the ratio of your debt to your assessed value because, while all of the tax revenues of the State or the counties naturally are available for the payment of the debt, it's been customary for bond holders to look to the real property tax as their collateral. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.496" offset="15206844">That is the authority on which the Guam Supreme Court relied and it applies to this case and it explain why the word Ms. Brinkmann addressed, but even where it's full value, it is only pursuant to a determination that for assessment purposes full value should be used.</text>
