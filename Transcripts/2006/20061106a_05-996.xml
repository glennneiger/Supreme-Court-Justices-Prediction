            <text syncTime="10.606" offset="194608">Section 706(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a debtor may convert a case under chapter 7 to a case under any other chapter of the Bankruptcy Code at any time if the case has not been converted previously from another chapter, and that any waiver of the right to convert a case under the subsection is unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.519" offset="274229">Other subsections of section 706 give rules for the Court to decide about conversion in the case where some party other than the debtor requests conversion of the case and also provides that the conversion must lead to a chapter to which that debtor is qualified to be a debtor.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.545" offset="534304">In fact, in that... in the present... the new case, the court decided that he was not eligible because his debt limit exceeded the statutory limitations that exist section 109(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="107.852" offset="583519">There is a three-year time span between the two, and we believe that the existing case is not moot because he still has remedies that he can obtain in Chapter 13.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.242" offset="729073">If we have a finding from the bankruptcy court that he is ineligible, that is number one condition to convert into Chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.916" offset="771809">If you don't meet that condition, that's the end of the matter.</text>

            <label>Mr. David G. Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="159.202" offset="788946">I wouldn't say it would be the end of the matter in the present case because the eligibility was never questioned below, was never a factor below.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="167.641" offset="822696">But now there has been a finding, and it's an essential finding, that there be eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.580" offset="850490">And wouldn't the bankruptcy court's findings in the later case have preclusive effect?</text>

            <text syncTime="185.002" offset="892182">I would say no, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.887" offset="899705">First, because as I mentioned, the issue of eligibility within the monetary limits was never raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.125" offset="924678">And in fact, if you look at his schedules in the supplemental joint appendix, he is clearly within the statutory limits based... just looking at his schedules.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="203.497" offset="966161">But that's a question you can argue on appeal in... from the recent decisions, but for the moment you have a bankruptcy court making that determination, which I think would be preclusive on another bankruptcy court.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.459" offset="1033974">The... well, the... the bankruptcy court made a decision in the current case, the new case, but they haven't dismissed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.946" offset="1059888">Dismissal is in fact on appeal to the District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.500" offset="1082144">The reason is, in our view is that the bankruptcy court in the new case incorrectly looked back to the claims that had been filed in the prior case.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.141" offset="1120701">Now, it is a difficult issue in some respects because there is case law at least in Massachusetts or the First Circuit that says a debtor does not have standing to object to claims in a Chapter 7 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.366" offset="1177648">So the fact that a number of claims were filed and argued doesn't relate to, in a prior case, does not have a preclusive effect in the new case.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.439" offset="1225922">Now we did, in fact, object to quite a number of claims and the eligibility, and I think that ultimately once the claim objections are resolved, we will be within the statutory limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.231" offset="1273047">If the decision is affirmed on appeal to the First Circuit, do you think you could still argue that there's qualification for Chapter 13, after the court of appeals has affirmed a determination that there isn't?</text>

            <text syncTime="308.500" offset="1386105">If that judgment is affirmed on appeal to the court of appeals, can you nonetheless argue that somehow there is no preclusive effect?</text>

            <text syncTime="320.224" offset="1433021">Yes, Your Honor, because there's a three-year difference between the two and substantially different facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.045" offset="1460293">The... we have to go back, I think, to the case that's at bar, because it is those claims, the claims that were filed in the current case that are the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.572" offset="1518389">As I say, we are in the process of doing objections to those claims and I think that ultimately we will come within them.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.029" offset="1568231">I mean, you're seeking to have the right to file under 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.349" offset="1589547">And if, in fact, there's no eligibility to file under 13, you're asking for the impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.055" offset="1620371">The case is simply... you know... it's just air.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.341" offset="1637507">So I guess, perhaps you rely on the fact that the case is still on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.978" offset="1660077">Should we not take as a given that there is a judgment that you don't qualify for 13, and yet you're coming before us asking us to say that you can apply under Chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.487" offset="1714098">It doesn't make any sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.606" offset="1722562">Well, I would respectfully say... suggest that it does, Your Honor, because once... we don't really get to the eligibility question until the court below considers it in the context of the case that's at bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.806" offset="7971365">706(a) says the debtor may convert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.358" offset="7993517">Whereas other sections of the code, like 1307(b), other provisions, provide that upon request of the debtor, the court shall take some particular action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1991.979" offset="8120054">And for a clear reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.264" offset="8125174">Nobody can force a debtor to continue in Chapter 13 against the debtor's will because Chapter 13 requires the debtor to work to pay off creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.037" offset="8164254">That would violate the 13th Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.686" offset="8170836">So there would be no circumstance where someone could block a debtor from getting out from Chapter 13, for constitutional reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.825" offset="8203437">That's a special case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.844" offset="8207512">That is why Congress drafted 1307(b) the way that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.744" offset="8219111">Contrast that with section 706 where the court said the debtor may convert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.700" offset="8242934">Now, there are, there are requirements that the debtor has to comply in order to convert, statutory, but there is also, a debtor cannot have an absolute right to convert if it would be part of an abusive scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.489" offset="8286089">I think the direct analogy is this Court's decision in Pepper versus Litton.</text>

            <text syncTime="3516.679" offset="14218810">The first thing I would like to say is that, having been counsel to a Chapter 13 trustee many years ago, I can assure the Court the Chapter 13 trustees exercise all of the powers and authority that a Chapter 7 trustee does, with the exception, as was said, of possession of property of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.241" offset="14289132">The property of the estate remains vested, however, in the Chapter 13 trustee throughout the length of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.097" offset="14324554">It does not revest in the debtor until the case is either dismissed, a discharge is issued, and the case is closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.136" offset="14360707">So the concerns about leaving a debtor to do anything it wants to with property of the bankruptcy estate simply is not a reality, and I think it does a disservice to the many fine Chapter 13 trustees that there are around the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3592.078" offset="14520472">So is it possible if it's in 13 that then the debtor, let's say a dishonest debtor, could get back pieces of paper which would admit that debtor to the possession of certain property which he could then take and hide in a way that that couldn't happen in 7?</text>

            <text syncTime="3610.491" offset="14594138">But then again, there are statutory and rule-based remedies for that sort of activity.</text>
