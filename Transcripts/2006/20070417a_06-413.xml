            <text syncTime="8.602" offset="186958">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.493" offset="198452">The Ninth Circuit's conclusion that Mr. Brown is entitled to habeas corpus relief should be reversed for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.224" offset="225410">First, under Section 2254(3)(16) of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act the trial judge's dismissal of Mr. Deal from the jury is a finding of fact of substantial impairment that is presumed correct unless it is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.450" offset="298344">Mr. Brown has not presented such evidence because the record before the State court supports the decision to remove Mr. Deal, especially since the trial judge had the opportunity to observe Mr. Deal and the defense had no objection to his removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.163" offset="357172">Second, under 2254(d)(2) the State court decision was based on a reasonable determination of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.767" offset="387579">Since the finding of fact was correct it is necessarily reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.189" offset="405237">And third, under 2254(d)(2), the State court decision was not contrary to Supreme Court precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.747" offset="435539">Since the trial court applied the correct standard under Witt and found as fact that Mr. Deal was substantially impaired and this case is immaterially indistinguishable from Witt, the State court's decision was a reasonable application of clearly established Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.586" offset="506906">Mr. Deal did indicate in the voir dire that he could impose the death penalty and consider it, but his other statements created an ambiguity which the trial judge was in the best position to resolve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.228" offset="7221420">There were in our view two findings by the Washington courts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.773" offset="7243572">The first by the trial court is objectively, an objectively unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented, and thus the writ should be granted under 50... 28... 2254(d)(2)?</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.004" offset="7308565">And the supreme court's decision... and I'll get to a moment to where I think their decision is, in the record, which conflicts with the State's view of where that is... was an unreasonable application of this Court's controlling precedent in Witt versus Witherspoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.591" offset="7366870">And I would direct the Court to, in terms of the State Supreme Court's finding, to page 173a of the appendix of the Petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.442" offset="7422250">But I would, of course, first like to start with the actual record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.909" offset="7444192">In this case, the Washington State trial court's decision to excuse juror Deal for cause was be objectively unreasonable based upon the record, because juror Deal said many times on the record, when presented with the question of whether or not he could impose the death penalty under the sketchy view he had of Washington State's statutory capital punishment scheme, that he could do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.612" offset="13738971">So the judge is dealing with Richard Deal in one paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.826" offset="13759869">The defendant raised a host of challenges, and so there's not perfect consistency with what these two passages in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.995" offset="13812532">But mustn't we take into account what this was?</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.446" offset="13826325">It was the defense brought out every objection they probably could conceive of and they didn't put particular emphasis on this, so it comes out this way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.890" offset="13900094">Now we're talking about the Washington Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.672" offset="13907200">You said they got it wrong because they said in this paragraph that he got the law you wrong, he made an incorrect statement of the law because he said he would impose the death penalty where the defendant would reviolate if released, which is not a correct statement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.039" offset="13988702">We don't know exactly what that court meant by that paragraph, but we do know that the Washington Supreme Court was basing... I don't know how many objections they were dealing with in this opinion, but a great many.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.499" offset="14046485">Yes, and so if you then turn to the end of the opinion, if that's what you're asking, at 208, there's kind of a summary of their basis for all of the challenges made by Mr. Brown to all sorts of things in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.418" offset="14098207">There were also challenges to other jurors as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.463" offset="14110432">And there are separate paragraphs where the court... those jurors that are mentioned in the summary paragraph, where the court then explains the various reasons why it's upholding the trial judge as to those jurors as well.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3507.331" offset="14181903">Well, my point is simply that where the court is faced with so many challenges, this particular one, there had been no objection at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.684" offset="14223281">So an appellate court might think we don't want to spend too much time on that one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.979" offset="14244493">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.322" offset="14253792">It appears as though what they did was to, because this is not what the trial judge said, this is the basis for the objection by the prosecutor, that they assumed the trial judge adopted the prosecutor's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.739" offset="14303530">In sum, there's nothing in the record that supports a conclusion here that Juror Deal could not subordinate his personal views about the death penalty or that he would frustrate the State's legitimate purpose in carrying out the State's legitimate interest in a constitutional capital death penalty scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.918" offset="14404153">So we would ask this Court to affirm the opinion of Judge Kozinski in the Ninth Circuit and grant the writ of habeas corpus in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.289" offset="14441665">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3579.238" offset="14469459">In response to the questions regarding the Witherspoon language and whether it's still good law, the Court in Witt essentially said that is no longer the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.029" offset="14508643">The standard instead is the substantial impairment standard, and it is not required to show that the juror would never impose the death penalty or automatically vote against it by unmistakable clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.121" offset="14557022">And the fact that there were... in response to Justice Ginsburg's question, the fact that there were so many claims presented to the State Supreme Court may explain in part the summary opinion regarding this particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.412" offset="14618148">AEDPA does not require a perfect opinion by the State court to survive review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.017" offset="14636643">It only requires reasonableness and an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.675" offset="14651272">In addition, the arguments presented by Mr. Brown are essentially: We disagree and the Federal courts should disagree with the factfinding process done by the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.170" offset="14709159">But the fact that a reviewing court reviewing the same transcript may reach a different factual determination is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.944" offset="14740297">If the view reached by the State court is supported by evidence and is... thank you, Your Honor.</text>
