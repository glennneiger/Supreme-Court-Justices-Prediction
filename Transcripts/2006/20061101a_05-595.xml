            <text syncTime="315.169" offset="1405267">However, in Atkins v.

            <text syncTime="345.088" offset="1524908">The Federal court could then look at that because it was only a procedural determination by the state court on the second habeas claim and the Federal court at that point could look back at the substantive rule as established law because on the second claim they have the right, if he's only denied a procedure... on a procedural basis, there's nothing that would preclude the Federal court on his second claim from looking back at what would then be established law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.849" offset="4831906">The first is that Roberts had a built-in reliability screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.172" offset="4853222">Hearsay could not be admitted under Roberts unless a determination was made that there were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.829" offset="4943814">They included the right to cross-examine the witness through whom an hearsay statement was introduced, the right to introduce your own evidence to challenge the reliability of the hearsay statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.737" offset="4991462">Defense counsel could point out to the jury all the weaknesses in the hearsay statement and the defendant could count on the common sense of the jury to weigh the reliability of the hearsay statement in light of all the evidence in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.991" offset="5644523">And I cited in the brief there are three or four death penalty cases where the Court had already established before each one of them there was a right not to be... the death penalty to be arbitrarily imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.712" offset="5699380">And in each case there was a new rule that built on that basic rule in an important way; but in each case, the Court said it was not the kind of rule that was going to be applied retroactively.</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.091" offset="5816931">In the case of non-testimonial hearsay, under Roberts, that could come in only if determination had been made there were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.437" offset="6218276">I think it applies equally to Federal courts because it is free to the Federal court system to devise a rule that would allow a looser standard of entry than the Roberts standards, and if it did, that would be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.866" offset="6284000">So there is an interest in that kind of argument in the Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.579" offset="6298838">I wanted to move on to the bedrock aspect of the inquiry, which is a separate second inquiry that had threshold that has to be crossed if you are going to find something to be watershed, and the only rule that the Court has found to be bedrock is Gideon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.481" offset="6362472">And this rule, Carawford does not approach Gideon in its fundamental and sweeping importance, and there are a couple of reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.149" offset="6397163">First, the right to counsel pervasively affected all aspects of the criminal trial whereas this focuses on one limited... the admissibility of one limited category of evidence, testimonial hearsay, and adopts a somewhat new rule for that than had existed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.989" offset="6464454">The second thing is that under, the right to counsel is deemed so essential to a fair trial that depriving someone of that right can never be discounted as harmless error, whereas Crawford errors can be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.671" offset="6535194">There are a significant number of cases where they are found to be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.863" offset="6548046">So you cannot say that a violation of the Crawford rule always and necessarily results in an unfair trial, whereas you can say that about the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.749" offset="6591514">Finally, the Gideon rule established for the first time a right to free counsel in all felony criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.503" offset="6622547">Before Crawford was established, there was a right to cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.688" offset="6643341">It simply was a different right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.539" offset="6650655">You had a right to cross-examine the live witnesses and you had a right to screen out uncross-examined statements unless they met the reliability standard of Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.606" offset="6690988">And the change that was made was one in which the Roberts rule was thrown out, and you can no longer get in uncross-examined statements with a determination of reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.954" offset="6736337">But that is a modification or an incremental change in an existing right that previously existed to cross-examine, and instead... unlike the Gideon rule, which established the right to counsel for the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1987.455" offset="8094391">I think the issue of whether something is structural error or harmless error has to do with whether or not it is measurable, not whether it's bedrock, not whether it's watershed, not whether it leads to better accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.574" offset="8138799">We know that, because in Teague, although Gideon was the only case explicitly referenced, there was also three other examples mentioned in Teague.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.213" offset="8201388">There was a trial flawed because of the intentional introduction of perjured testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.106" offset="8225003">And there was a trial flawed by the introduction of testimony with regard to a coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.419" offset="8246214">We know that two out of those three examples are actually subject to harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.416" offset="8278188">So this Court has never tied the issue of the elements of Teague or even the elements of the pre-Teague jurisprudence to the issue of whether something is structural or harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.053" offset="8320716">It is the issue, as it was in the more recent decision of Gonzalez-Lopez, of the right to choice of counsel decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.833" offset="8383827">And in this case, courts are accustomed, appellate courts are accustomed to looking at the introduction of this kind of evidence and determining whether or not it is harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.822" offset="8427818">The State has not taken a position before this Court that the Ninth Circuit was erroneous in determining that this evidence was prejudicial, and therefore affected the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.918" offset="8472226">So the issue of accuracy as defined by the State and by the government, the problem with that argument and the easiest way to see the problem in that argument is if you look to Gideon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.656" offset="8527187">Certainly we wouldn't argue that the insertion of counsel into a case may not result in what the State is defining as a more accurate result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.705" offset="8575357">The insertion of counsel into a case may well cause the exclusion of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.318" offset="8597822">In fact, in many instances that is exactly what counsel does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.493" offset="8614541">So their definition of accuracy if applied to the Gideon case would mean that Gideon would flunk that definition, and wouldn't be the case that has been so repeatedly referenced by this Court as an example of the kind of case that should be made retroactive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2213.633" offset="8999063">That was not the purpose of the Batson rule, this Court found that it wasn't the purpose of the Batson rule, and that therefore, it would not fall under the Teague exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="2678.482" offset="10858459">I think the easiest way to explain our position on that is that what has been articulated here is that a retroactive... a rule made retroactive by this court would be applicable to Mr. Bockting if he had not raised this issue or had been somehow procedurally defaulted along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.319" offset="10957829">In other words, in order to be able to get the advantage that was discussed by both the state and the government of the other sections of the statute which clearly recognize, as to the extent that it's relevant the sponsor of the legislation did, that you still have the power to make rules retroactive, but the only way that Mr. Bockting would be able to get advantage of that rule would be if the state court had never ruled on the merits of his claim or had made some sort of procedural ruling that meant that he was defaulted on the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.603" offset="11090949">So instead of Mr. Bockting, who has raised this question of being able to cross-examine his accuser from day one in the trial, he cannot have that rule applied retroactively to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.672" offset="11151240">If instead he now, he goes back later and the court says, no, this is a successor petition, you can't, you can't get it, you can't come into our courtroom, the door is slammed on you, according to the state now there's no ruling on the merits of his claim, and that's why that section of the statute would permit the retroactive rule to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.172" offset="11225218">2254(d)(1), while it has the language clearly established, and the court asked some questions about that, I think it must be remembered that when that statute is being addressed, it's being addressed in state court... or in Federal court, on Federal habeas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.116" offset="12449003">And it is those decisions where we must worry whether or not an innocent man has been convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3100.203" offset="12545342">So if it is only that small core of rules that you reserved in Teague, only that small core of rules, and we know it won't be many at this point, then if you read that compatibly with AEDPA, it is not and, as we know, it is not going to open the floodgates.</text>

            <text syncTime="3149.824" offset="12743873">It is from that date forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.424" offset="12750247">So there is a defined population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.886" offset="12756098">In appendix 1 of our brief, you will see all of the decisions that we could find that have actually applied Crawford and there were 49 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.024" offset="12796640">And what you'll find is that of the decisions... and the state and the government have not disputed this... of the 49 decisions which we were able to find at the time of the writing of that brief, only five actually resulted in relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.052" offset="12852751">There's no question it would result in relief here because there is no contention before you that the Ninth Circuit's determination of harmfulness... there is no determination before you; they haven't challenged that to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.979" offset="12904474">So it would result in relief for Mr. Bockting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.332" offset="12917849">But because it's harmless error or it's not testimonial or there was a previous opportunity to cross-examine, of the 49 decisions only 5 were found to have to result in relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.887" offset="13344062">First of all, counsel's argument with regard to the interpretation of 2254(d)(1) clearly established language is inconsistent with the statement made... statements made by this Court in Lockyer and in Williams v. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.048" offset="13404771">In Lockyer, the Court stated Section 2254(d)(1)'s clearly established phase referred to the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions as of the time of the relevant state court decision, citing Williams v. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.056" offset="13460778">In other words, clearly established federal law under 2254(d)(1) is the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.904" offset="13508111">With regard to counsel's point about this case in particular, Bockting, I agree that there are broader issues beyond this particular fact situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.333" offset="13561924">However, I want the Court to feel comfortable that when this Court sent this case back down to the Nevada Supreme Court and told the Nevada Supreme Court to follow Ohio... Idaho versus Wright, the factors in Idaho versus Wright to determine trustworthiness, talk about spontaneity and consistent reputation... repetition, mental state of declarant, use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, and lack of motive to fabricate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.861" offset="13667981">Particularized guarantees of trustworthiness must be so trustworthy that adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.606" offset="13702985">Following that admonishment from this Court, the Nevada Supreme Court found those statements to be reliable and to satisfy the standards of Ohio... Idaho versus Wright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.404" offset="13750214">Finally, I would just point out that although Caldwell is indeed an important rule, and may, in fact, be a fundamental rule, so was Batson in Teague, as was Caldwell in Sawyer, as was Ring in Summerlin, as was Duncan in DiStefano as was Mills in Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.256" offset="13821581">Yet this Court failed to apply retroactive status to any of those important fundamental rules saying none of them rose to the level of Gideon versus Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.063" offset="13864840">The same should be true with your decision here with respect to Crawford.</text>
