            <text syncTime="10.622" offset="199245">A jury found that at the time petitioner filed for charge of discrimination with the EEOC, respondent was paying her less for each week's work than it paid similarly situated male employees and that it did so because of her sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.698" offset="251594">The question for the Court is whether that present act of disparate treatment because of sex constituted a present violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.452" offset="282628">This Court has already answered that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.721" offset="295689">Consistent with the law's traditional treatment of pay as arising from recurring transactions and giving rise to recurring causes of action, and consistent with the paycheck accrual rule everyone agrees Congress adopted for the Equal Pay Act, this Court in Bazemore versus Friday held under Title VII, each week's paycheck that offers less to an employee because of her race or sex--</text>

            <text syncTime="79.100" offset="473217">As a practical matter, while it's always the case or almost always the case that somebody knows they have been subject to disparate treatment in a promotion case... they know that they didn't get the promotion and somebody else did... it is frequently possible for an employee to be subject to disparate pay without ever knowing that she has been treated differently than anybody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.435" offset="582513">It's a question of specificity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.985" offset="592753">If the, if the employee, he alleges that promotions were based on experience and the employee didn't have the experience because of past discrimination, why is that different than the paycheck rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="124.397" offset="654402">I take it indicates that you would not allow the, a cause of action unless the discrimination was within the statute of limitations period?</text>

            <text syncTime="141.693" offset="723575">Because in a promotion decision the employee is deprived of the opportunity to take on added responsibilities and therefore earn more pay, but in, but the pay itself is not discriminatory in the sense of treating people doing the same work differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.408" offset="826393">I mean, there may be no different responsibilities but it's a single act of discrimination:</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="183.269" offset="889818">Because, I think the difference is that when somebody is denied a promotion for discriminatory reasons the paychecks themselves are not discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.639" offset="919284">They treat similarly situated workers differently.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="193.975" offset="932659">Mr. Russell, I thought that your argument was that yes, you know that you haven't got the promotion, you know you haven't got the transfer, but the spread in the pay is an incremental thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.068" offset="989083">You may think the first year you didn't get a raise, "well, so be it".</text>
            <text syncTime="213.372" offset="1010295">But you have, you have no reason to think that there is going to be this inequality.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.809" offset="1035999">I mean she started out getting the same pay, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="223.145" stopTime="299.311">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="223.145" offset="1049374">Yes, and that practical distinction I think does support Congress's decision under the Equal Pay Act as well as under Title VII to choose a paycheck accrual rule because it's frequently that even if an employee knows she has been subject to disparate pay, it's frequently very difficult for her to have a good faith belief that that pay is intentionally discriminatory without more information.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.574" offset="1135055">So for example, if you look at that chart on page 174 of the joint appendix, which summarizes the pay decisions for one of the years at issue here, if petitioner knew only the pay raise that she got that year, she would know that she got a 5.28 percent raise which is not... which is not suspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.370" offset="1206213">If she knew what Mr. Conte had gotten, she would know that in fact that pay raise decision decreased the disparity between her pay and Mr. Conte's pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.458" offset="1242575">If she knew what also happened with respect to Mr. Bice she would see he got a higher absolute raise than he did, but she got a bigger one than Todd.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.647" offset="1271310">It's only if petitioner had all of the information in this chart, that she would know that that pay raise decision increased the overall disparity between her wages and the average wages of men doing the same job.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.122" offset="1317286">And even then the amount of that disparity, standing alone wouldn't provide a sufficient reason to go claim intentional discrimination to the EEOC.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="299.311" stopTime="302.763">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="299.311" offset="1354066">How does, how does time solve that difficulty?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="302.763" stopTime="360.468">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="302.763" offset="1367859">It's only after... one would expect in a merit system that there would be some level of variation in the area and that would work out over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.285" offset="1397952">It's only when it doesn't, when the disparity persists, when the different treatment accrues again and again and the overall disparity in the wages increases, that the employee has some reasonable basis to think that it's not natural variation in the pay decisions but actually intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.914" offset="1468378">In the paycheck accrual rule that's been applied by the lower courts for more than 20 years without incident, adequately balances the interest of employees and being able to come forward once they find out that there is a reason to suspect discrimination, with an employer's reasonable interest in avoiding having to defend stale claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.392" offset="1542357">I think it's important to note that the Equal Pay Act, which everybody agrees has a paycheck accrual rule, imposes all of the same burdens on employers that respondents allege would have led Congress to never impose a paycheck accrual under Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.376" offset="1646324">The magistrate judge initially recommended dismissing both the Title VII and equal pay claims on the grounds that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.799" offset="1679970">The District Courts held that there were fact disputes that precluded that conclusion, but for some reason only reinstated the Title VII claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.987" offset="1720721">As I understand the magistrate judge he said, yes, you had made it across the first hurdle, you had a prima facie case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.817" offset="9616074">If we follow the other side's rule, it's very simple, we just said Bazemore applies, whether there's a practice or whether it was a discrete thing, or whatever, so it's simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.006" offset="9652750">But we do have to distinguish pay from the other kinds of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.143" offset="9669364">And we have heard them explain why there is a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.429" offset="9678455">I'd rather get to your side and then you can attack both, or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.131" offset="9697263">Your side of it, it seems to me, if I agree to you, I now have to create in the law some kind of thing that sounds very complicated about whether that old bad thing was somehow a pattern or a practice that, as a pattern or a practice, didn't get eradicated within the last few years, or was a totally discrete act, and therefore, had no implication as a pattern or practice that didn't get eradicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.281" offset="9797886">That sounds hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.598" offset="9803111">And the second thing I guess I'd have to do is to create a lot of tolling law because there will be probably a significant number of circumstances where a woman is being paid less, and all she does is for the last six months get her paychecks and she doesn't really know it because pay is a complicated thing, and through no fault of her own, it takes about eight or nine months or even a year for her to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.032" offset="9912930">And we are going to have to toll, aren't we?</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.384" offset="9922334">So I have, legally speaking, a complicated tolling system that I have to graft on to this, your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.573" offset="9951069">I also have to start distinguishing Bazemore which is pretty hard to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.608" offset="9967160">But on the other side, they are just saying, go with the flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.893" offset="9980326">Nobody is really hurt, because the employer has to worry about all this stuff anyway under the Equal Pay Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.551" offset="10031003">Well, it was a compound question, but I'll try to answer each of its parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.189" offset="10049498">The first point I would make is that Bazemore came after Evans and Hazelwood and Ricks, and it did not distinguish Evans or Hazelwood or Ricks on the grounds that Bazemore is a pay case and Hazelwood and Evans were not pay cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.198" offset="10109580">It distinguished them on the grounds of whether or not the alleged discrimination was taking place in the charge filing period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.720" offset="10143643">So this notion that Bazemore stands as a proposition that Evans and Lorance and that line of cases doesn't apply because they don't apply to pay cases was not the opinion of the Court in Bazemore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.462" offset="10190664">Secondly, we are not asking you, and I don't think it takes any difficulty to apply the rule that we are proposing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.116" offset="10217204">We are proposing the same rule that's set forth in Justice Stevens' opinion for the Court in Evans, the same rule that's set forth in Justice Powell's opinion in Ricks, the same rule that's set forward in Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court in Lorance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.174" offset="13953446">I think the fundamental disagreement in this case comes down to what is the unlawful employment practice Congress was referring to when it prohibited discrimination with respect to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.863" offset="13992211">If it is under our view, in our view, the payment of an intentionally disparate wage, then there's no question that under Bazemore the violation occurred during the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.106" offset="14041217">The fact that the intent was formed outside the limitations period doesn't make the present payment of a disparate wage because of sex any less intentionally discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.295" offset="14081968">But the difference in the conceptions, which frankly isn't answered by the plain text of this statute itself, should be resolved in light of the practical consequences of the differences in the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.603" offset="14123137">The Solicitor General acknowledges that a paycheck accrual rule applies at least in a case of a policy of discrimination, but that's a very difficult rule to administer for the EEOC, which must make a determination of timeliness before it even has authority to investigate a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.695" offset="14183532">It shouldn't be left to the EEOC to figure out whether there's an unwritten practice or an unwritten policy which would require an extensive investigation not only of the petitioner's pay but of everybody else's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.385" offset="14226269">You recall that in Bazemore they had to conduct a multiple regression analysis to establish a pattern of discrimination there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.389" offset="14250301">Our rule is simple to administer and has been administered for decades in the lower courts and it's the rule that the EEOC itself has chosen in construing this ambiguous aspect of the statute.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3535.597" offset="14299202">Do you agree that their action is just based on Bazemore or their reading of Bazemore?</text>

          <turn speaker="kevin_k_russell" startTime="3540.501" stopTime="3602.991">
            <label>Mr. Kevin K. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="3540.501" offset="14318742">No, that's incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.501" offset="14322817">I mean, the EEOC has taken this position that you can challenge present pay disparities even before the Court's decision in Bazemore and it continued to adhere to it afterward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.456" offset="14354582">The fact that they cited to Bazemore shouldn't disentitle them to the kind of deference that they're ordinarily entitled to when they construe a statute that's given to them, and this is precisely the kind of question Congress would have entitled them to exercise their expertise on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.949" offset="14412574">Finally, I would like to raise the point that under respondent's rule the Extension Service would have been permitted to pay blacks less than white in perpetuity in Bazemore so long as it did so because of cost and not because it wanted to continue to discriminate on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.744" offset="14479761">And similarly, under the Solicitor General's view an employer who had intentionally discriminated through discrete decisions against some of its employees prior to the act would be allowed to continue to do so after the act because the decision would have been the potentially unlawful act in that case and that wouldn't have been actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.955" offset="14548620">We respectfully suggest that Congress intended nothing than a complete--</text>
