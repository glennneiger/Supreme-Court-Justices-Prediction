            <text syncTime="8.967" offset="184950">Mr. Lawrence in this case made an application for relief in the state courts of Florida, that unfortunately was denied to him, the relief that he sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.134" offset="229567">Consequently, he came here to the United States Supreme Court on a certiorari review and the certiorari, although it was denied, he did present to this Court an issue on which it could have acted had it chosen to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.985" offset="308979">It is well within the power under 28 U.S.C. 2104 for this Court to modify, vacate, remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.122" offset="341580">In other words, this Court can and could have affected that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.385" offset="362583">Our position is that this... there is a distinction between the, quote, 2104 and the original writ of certiorari which would lie in this Court in some instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.158" offset="433740">When one uses the appeal, one is not making a new application.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.118" offset="8277580">I mean, I'm not following... I think I think this argument about the word is metaphysical, you know, and I can make wonderful arguments, and you have made wonderful arguments on both sides of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.160" offset="8321675">I just can't get a clear answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.300" offset="8330243">So if I were right about that and there is no clear answer from the language, then the thing, I'd like to go back to Justice Stevens' question, because it seems to me that that puts my greatest concern, my greatest concerns are practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.652" offset="8391683">If we take your position, we have words right next to each other, near each other in the same statutory provision, meaning different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.212" offset="8429926">And I've learned out of my own experience perhaps, judges and lawyers are not always geniuses and they get mixed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.380" offset="8458557">And they will get mixed up all the time, and when they get mixed up, people will lose rights that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.799" offset="8488232">The second concern of Justice Stevens, which is what happens in the case, and those are the ones who intuitively are going to cause the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.031" offset="8525221">Because on a rare occasion, the state or the prisoner has a very good Supreme Court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.887" offset="8552597">And that's going to be the case where he forgets to file in the Federal court because he thinks this thing isn't over, and lo and behold, the Court grants it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.695" offset="8591886">And now what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.398" offset="8598677">On your interpretation, I just see a mess, and on the other interpretation, it seems to work out fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.348" offset="8626472">So those, I would say are the two practical problems, and anything you would like to say about that, I'd like to listen to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.814" offset="8656356">Thank you, Justice Breyer, and I would respectfully answer your question I think in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.109" offset="8673492">First, drawing a distinction between when the state petitions for certiorari and when the habeas petitioner petitions for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.419" offset="8702749">Under both circumstances, equitable principles would apply, but they would apply in I think different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.119" offset="8729499">But in either circumstance, the ability of the petitioner to subsequently seek habeas review would be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.756" offset="8760114">And so what we are advocating is not making those exceptional cases the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.130" offset="8777564">In a case where the state petitions for certiorari there isn't an ability, there is no way to even file a protective habeas because there is nothing to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.360" offset="8810478">You've won, the habeas petitioner has won in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.515" offset="8823121">There is no cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.234" offset="8830018">There isn't a basis upon which to file a Federal habeas claim, so even a protective one would be, it wouldn't be premature, it would be effectively nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.214" offset="8865962">So from an equitable standpoint, the extraordinary circumstance which the courts have recognized, the circuits have recognized that the test for equitable circumstance is, the extraordinary circumstance would be this Court accepting certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.039" offset="8913192">And then the exercise of diligence on the part of the petitioner is if the petitioner did everything he or she could under that circumstance, because there would be no way for that petitioner to file for a Federal habeas review because there would be no basis for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.563" offset="12211308">If they choose not to file for cert, then they voluntarily if they pass the 90 days forfeited that right; and if they don't file within the statutory period then they have under AEDPA missed the statute of limitations deadline.</text>
