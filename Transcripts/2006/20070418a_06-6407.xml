            <text syncTime="9.272" offset="187689">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.241" offset="207647">The Fifth Circuit found that Scott Panetti suffers from paranoid delusions that cause him to believe that he is being executed because of a conspiracy against him and not as punishment for his crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.935" offset="274416">Despite that finding, the Fifth Circuit held that Scott Panetti is competent to be executed because an inmate need not have a rational understanding of the reason for his execution but only be aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.278" offset="335751">This standard is a profound misreading of Ford versus Wainwright but before I address the merits of that issue, I would like to discuss two preliminary matters first.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.335" offset="391967">First, Scott Panetti's petition containing his execution competency claim is not second or successive under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.743" offset="437629">And second, the State court adjudication of that claim resulted in a decision that was an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law as determined by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.153" offset="495307">The first issue: This is not a second or successive petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.925" offset="522370">Martinez-Villareal recognized that a numerically second petition is not successive, it's not a mere mathematical computation, it's a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.733" offset="569600">And if you bring the claim the first time it's justiciable, it's not second or successive.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.268" offset="591751">Texas law--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="111.303" offset="595827">Wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.770" offset="597707">I didn't understand that to be what the case said.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.672" offset="609306">I thought that the case held that it wasn't successive there because the claim had, in fact, been brought in the first petition, and that first petition was dismissed as premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.848" offset="666044">And the argument was made that this is just a continuation of that first petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.668" offset="689345">Now, the difference here is that the claim was not brought in the first petition, even though it was pretty clear after that case of ours that you had a sure route to raising the claim if you raised it prematurely, and then brought the petition later.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory W. Wiercioch</label>
            <text syncTime="156.182" offset="775340">--Your Honor, I think the difference is, or the central holding, I believe, of Martinez-Villareal is that we do not bring these Ford claims until they are justiciable, until they're ripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.140" offset="827167">It's the unique nature of Ford claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.026" offset="838765">They are uniquely time specific.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="174.377" stopTime="187.720">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="174.377" offset="848169">If you bring it earlier, it will be unripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.262" offset="863738">But it did, I think, leave open the precise procedural posture that we're in now.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.768" offset="889756">It didn't resolve that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_w_wiercioch" startTime="187.720" stopTime="264.452">
            <label>Mr. Gregory W. Wiercioch</label>
            <text syncTime="187.720" offset="901564">Martinez-Villareal did not resolve that question, Your Honor, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.172" offset="919327">The other problem with the case, I think, is as you suggest, Justice Scalia, that there is a real danger that these claims could be adjudicated prematurely.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.532" offset="980767">And that has happened in the Fifth Circuit, a case that both the State and we have cited in our briefs, Valdez versus Cockrell.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.954" offset="1006471">And that was a post Martinez-Villareal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.487" offset="1016607">The other thing to keep in mind is that Texas law believes that these claims are premature as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.458" offset="1040431">So it was premature under Martinez-Villareal, but it was also unexhausted and unexhaustible under Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.666" offset="1077316">And I think what Martinez-Villareal and Texas recognize together is that these claims are most efficiently litigated at the end of the process, because of the unique nature of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.057" offset="1126844">The constitutional violation here is forward looking, unlike most constitutional habeas claims that are backward looking.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.413" offset="1164251">And it's the State's setting of the date or making it imminent that triggers the violation, that it is now going to carry out the execution of someone who is potentially mentally incompetent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="264.452" stopTime="321.970">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="264.452" offset="1208450">The difference is that in Martinez-Villareal, it was plausible to say that this was not a second petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.242" offset="1247634">Now you may be quite right, that there is good reason to say you shouldn't bring something that isn't ripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.480" offset="1272607">But in that earlier case, we were able to get around the language of the statute which says a second or successive petition is not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.554" offset="1328822">Here, how do you get around the language other than to say it shouldn't be that way, that you should be able to bring a second or successive petition when you're raising an issue that was not ripe at the time of the first petition?</text>
            <text syncTime="308.048" offset="1382844">I mean, as a policy matter, that's a very good argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.666" offset="1397263">But what do you do with the language in the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="313.650" offset="1405204">And after all, Congress is entitled to say... to place limits upon our ability to review State court judgments.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory W. Wiercioch</label>
            <text syncTime="321.970" offset="1438537">My answer would be that the Court didn't make the mere mathematical calculation in Martinez-Villareal.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.510" offset="1472705">That claim actually was raised twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.212" offset="1479497">It was raised in the first petition, and it was raised in a second when it was ripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.246" offset="1495588">We've only brought our Ford claim one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.948" offset="1506455">We brought it when it was ripe, when the execution date was set.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.233" offset="1519621">And I think that's the difference there.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="344.335" offset="1527980">It doesn't say a second run at the same claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.239" offset="1555565">It says a second petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.191" offset="1563402">Even if you bring new petitions in your second claim that weren't raised in your first, it's still a second or successive petition, and I find it hard to get over that language.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.749" offset="1609691">The only thing I can say is that the claim in a sense doesn't even exist until the State is announcing its intention to carry out the execution in the near future by setting the date.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.008" offset="1666638">And if we adopt the rule that the State wants, it's going to have, as in Martinez-Villareal, perverse and seemingly far-reaching consequences for habeas practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.650" offset="1713240">Is it material to your position to show that there was deterioration in his mental condition between the time of the sentence and the time you brought the petition?</text>
            <text syncTime="401.672" offset="1757335">I.e., the... during his incarceration, his condition worsened?</text>

            <text syncTime="406.576" offset="1776979">I think that is definitely part of it, Your Honor, but it also is the fact that we cannot predict with any reliability how severe mental illnesses are going to influence somebody's mental processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.704" offset="1849495">And the nature of delusions themselves that fluctuate in intensity and severity, often influenced by life events, can have an impact on the inmate's ability to understand the reason for his execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.083" offset="1918981">In this case it is, his delusion is wrapped up, it's central to it, as the reason he's being executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.772" offset="1953776">And the intensity of his delusions or our ability to predict that is... we can't do it until that event actually occurs, the event that's going to influence him, and that's the setting of the date.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.272" offset="2063699">Couldn't you have fit your claim under 2244(b)(2)(B), I guess, on that basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="491.349" offset="2116049">And then we don't have to engage in the fiction that a second petition is actually not a second petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.002" offset="2142693">I don't think we could have fit under that provision, Your Honor, because that provision requires that the evidence, established by clear and convincing evidence but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.433" offset="2228375">I suppose it doesn't fit comfortably under there, but I guess the argument would be that... guilty of... we've used the concept of being guilty of the death sentence as opposed to guilty of the crime before, and the fact finder... you wouldn't be sentenced to death if the sentencer had known you were incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.762" offset="2309668">I appreciate that it's not the most comfortable fit, but at least the part... it seems to be addressed to the question of a factual predicate that's not present at the time of the first habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.922" offset="2362331">And that seems to be your justification for not filing it at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.914" offset="2414262">I think it would be as if trying to force a petitioner to raise, who's attacking a sentence of a number of years, to raise in that petition deprivation of good time credits, that there would be no claim at that point for them to raise it.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.312" offset="3567934">To get back to your question, Justice Kennedy, the problem here... let me just say, the essential language of Justice Powell's decision on the minimum due process requirements is that, number one, an impartial decision-maker is required; and secondly, that decision-maker has to have the ability to hear argument and receive evidence from prisoner's counsel, including expert psychiatric evidence that may differ from the State's own psychiatric examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.449" offset="3696457">That boils down to exactly what we didn't have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.437" offset="3712444">Now the key point is when the State's or the court's appointed experts went to evaluate Mr. Panetti, new issues were raised; and those are the issues, they were determinative issues, that we didn't have an opportunity to respond to.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.046" offset="3782870">What happened is when they went to see Mr. Panetti, they characterized his behavior as filibustering about the Bible, answering questions with Biblical verses, refusing to answer questions until they told him whether or not they were Christians.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.908" offset="3850266">They took all of those behaviors to mean that Mr. Panetti was controlling, manipulating and deliberately refusing to answer questions, leading them to the conclusion that Mr. Panetti was competent and he was just malingering.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.518" offset="3908676">That is exactly the type of evidence that we were not able to respond to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.387" offset="6232215">And the reason being if the person in your hypothetical is suffering from a mental illness, and these mental illnesses are very small fraction of the type that include delusions, distortions in thought content, distortions in perception, distortions in thinking, that those very things prevent them from being reasoned out of their delusion by the facts that you've suggested.</text>

            <text syncTime="3120.185" offset="12631379">Turning to the merits or returning to the merits, there was a square factual finding that Panetti knows that he's been sentenced to death for committing these murders, and an additional factual finding that he has the capacity to understand the reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.998" offset="12714658">The district court didn't resolve whether he, in fact, understands the reason for it, although the State court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.986" offset="12738586">The State court explicitly concluded that he in fact understands the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.140" offset="12755200">The circumstance we have here is exactly the circumstance suggested by Justice Souter's hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.127" offset="12787173">You have an individual who knows he committed a crime, knows he's going to die, knows that he is... the State is going to execute him because he committed the crime, but he doesn't believe that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.784" offset="12829805">He at least asserts he believes something else is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.053" offset="12842867">But nothing in this Court's precedents or nothing in the principles behind the Eighth Amendment require a prisoner to believe the State's motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.509" offset="12884662">It is enough that he is able to prepare to die, and the central focus Justice Powell focused on was the ability to prepare oneself to die.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.865" offset="12918099">Panetti knows he's going to be put to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.800" offset="12925831">There's an exchange in the record with respect to one of his experts where he was talking about other executions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.375" offset="12972120">And in particular he goes through with Dr. Mary Alice Conroy on page 148 of the joint appendix, he's talking about what happens when other people are executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.165" offset="13023320">And he says, you know, well, they go to be executed and then sometimes they get a stay, and when they get a stay they come back, and when they don't get a stay, well, then they go on either to be with the lord or someplace too horrible to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.008" offset="13074729">And his understanding of that is in marked contrast to Alvin Ford's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.579" offset="13100956">Alvin Ford is the simplest and clearest metric to compare an individual defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.399" offset="13128228">Alvin Ford didn't know he was going to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.601" offset="13137005">He was unaware of what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.451" offset="13144424">And this Court concluded in Ford that it was cruel and irrational to subject someone who had no idea what was coming to the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.659" offset="13185280">Here Panetti knows he's going to die and he also knows he's guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.527" offset="13200744">So in terms of preparing for death, he can make his peace with the lord, he can make his peace with the victim's family, he can prepare for death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.781" offset="13229792">He may in fact not believe the State's reasons, although it's worth noting that no court has ever so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.322" offset="13267931">What the Federal district court said is that his experts state that he doesn't believe the reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.326" offset="13295934">But on the other side, no fewer than six different professional psychiatrists have concluded that Panetti is deliberately exaggerating his symptoms, that he is malingering, that he's acting bizarre in order to appear more insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.235" offset="13359569">And that presents a very difficult factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.389" offset="13376182">What do you do with someone who plainly has some mental illness, but at the same time whom six psychiatrists who have studied him, in some cases for years, who have treated him for years, six professional psychiatrists come in and tell the district court this individual is exaggerating?</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.601" offset="13449012">That is an incredibly difficult factual matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.570" offset="13460924">The only way our system can deal with it is to let the factfinder hear the competing experts and make a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.057" offset="13486837">In this case, the Federal district court concluded that the evidence of malingering, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.611" offset="13509093">"casts doubt on the extent of Panetti's mental illness and symptoms. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.098" offset="13527066">And that's at page 363 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.216" offset="13539500">Rather than resolve the question whether he in fact doesn't believe the State's reasons, what the district court said is the Constitution doesn't require that he believe the State's reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.024" offset="13590700">The Constitution simply requires that he know what is happening, that he understand what is happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.528" offset="13616718">The test we have proposed focusing on two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.749" offset="13633645">One, capacity, which Panetti now agrees; and the second thing we suggest is the test should be whether a defendant can recognize he's going to die and the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.021" offset="13670739">And "recognize", we submit is consistent with the words Justice Powell used, Justice Powell used the words "understand", "aware of", and "perceive".</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.210" offset="13707520">And so recognize was our attempt to capture what Justice Powell was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.364" offset="13728104">It is less than rational understanding, it is less than the full panoply of being able to make all the litigation decisions one is required, say, to waive counsel; because as Panetti concedes in his reply brief, there are no strategic decisions remaining to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.790" offset="13789858">At the time of execution, all that remains is for him to make peace and move on so that the State may execute a justly entered sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.229" offset="13827578">That test, we submit, is entirely consistent with this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.899" offset="13854223">It furthers both retribution and deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.835" offset="13866031">One point on deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.953" offset="13870419">The test Panetti points out really invites abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.339" offset="13887973">Because rational understanding is... is a standard that, particularly when you think about mental illness and the ability through medications of an individual to affirmatively decide to stop taking medications and exacerbate his symptom, it invites real abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.284" offset="13955787">Because rational standard we would... or rational understanding we would suggest is too high of a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.937" offset="13982432">In our prisons there are unfortunately a great many people suffering from some degree of mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.710" offset="14013466">At some level that's unsurprising.</text>
