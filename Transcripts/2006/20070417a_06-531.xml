            <text syncTime="7.356" offset="186838">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.868" offset="196869">The court of appeals held that plaintiffs who obtain a preliminary injunction are prevailing parties entitled to fees, even though the district court concluded that the State's nudity ban does not violate the Constitution, that plaintiffs were not entitled to any permanent relief, and that final judgment should be entered against the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.199" offset="270220">This Court's cases have found plaintiffs to be prevailing parties in only two situations, when they win judgment on the merits or enter into a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.207" offset="310240">And this Court has declined to confer prevailing party status based on interim rulings in ongoing litigation.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="44.790" offset="336572">Ms. Seitz, I'd be curious to get your reaction to one of the points made by opposing counsel, which is that there were really sort of two different pieces of litigation at issue here, that it was an as-applied challenge that produced the preliminary injunction, and what was rejected in the final decision was a facial challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.098" offset="445868">Is there anything to that?</text>

            <label>Ms. Virginia A. Seitz</label>
            <text syncTime="73.650" offset="452033">No, I don't think there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.110" offset="457884">In the preliminary injunction, the district court predicted that it would find the nudity ban significantly infringed free expression and that the State had less restrictive alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.348" offset="498844">That's at page 18a and 19a.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.548" offset="507621">In the summary judgment decision, the court held that the nudity plan's effect on free impression was de minimis and it had, that the State had no less restrictive alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.045" offset="549626">So in both instances the underlying legal claim was that as applied to nude expression the nudity ban was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.901" offset="581078">What do we make of what I understand was the court's post hoc statement that what was... the reason for issuing the temporary injunction was the perception that there was a content basis at work?</text>
            <text syncTime="123.773" offset="652549">And what do we make of it in light of the fact... I think this is of record; you correct me if I'm wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.967" offset="681283">what do we make of that in light of the fact that I believe it is in the record that I forget the appropriate State official said, well, it's true we've let you do this in the past, but this is political or this looks political, which suggests that there was a content basis going on?</text>
            <text syncTime="150.330" offset="758710">What do we make of the court's statement and the record statement by the official in deciding whether there really was in effect a separate kind of order involved in the preliminary injunction from the order that was denied at the end of the case?</text>

            <text syncTime="165.869" offset="820882">There's a factual answer to that and a legal answer, and I'll start with the legal answer, which is that the preliminary injunction itself states that it is assuming content--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="177.266" offset="866439">Because that's why I asked, what do we make of the court's statement subsequently?</text>

            <label>Ms. Virginia A. Seitz</label>
            <text syncTime="180.518" offset="879500">--I think we, as the court of appeals did, have to disregard those statements because under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the preliminary injunction itself is the operative document, and the bases that it states for the issuance of the preliminary injunction are the bases that must govern both on judicial review of the injunction and as a matter of notice to the parties of the operative effect and basis for the injunction.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="204.264" stopTime="211.940">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="204.264" offset="974482">Is that so when there is some evidence in the record that a content basis actually was the criterion?</text>

            <label>Ms. Virginia A. Seitz</label>
            <text syncTime="211.940" offset="1005202">And that's the factual part of my response, which is that this testimony that was relied on which we quote in full in our reply brief, was testimony by the State, a State official who did not make the decision so was not actually aware of why the decision was made, and was testimony only to the effect that the demonstration envisioned on February 14th might be different than her previous plays, because more people might be expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.965" offset="1105303">Now the court drew from that telephonic testimony a possibility that the reason for the State's denial on February 14 was the content; but in fact, although the court didn't recognize it, it also had before it a decision by the State in 2000 denying her permission to put on her play based on its decision to enforce its nudity ban against her at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.432" offset="1251171">The State denied her request in a letter indicating that the nudity ban would be enforced against the play.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="279.657" offset="1276039">So the factual answer in effect is there isn't enough fact to support the distinction?</text>

            <text syncTime="284.779" offset="1296519">And... and I guess there's in addition a legal elaboration on that factual record, which was this was all occurring in a preliminary injunction hearing that took place 24 hours before the demonstration, telephonic testimony of an ill-prepared State witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.249" offset="1354407">It was never followed up, even though that claim remained live through summary judgment, because the plaintiffs continued to have a claim against an individual defendant for damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.416" offset="1395053">But when you got to the summary judgment stage, the particular peace demonstration performance was... was behind them.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.909" offset="1421071">So they're, I'm not sure that it would have been expected to be reinjected into the case.</text>

            <label>Ms. Virginia A. Seitz</label>
            <text syncTime="322.083" offset="1445731">The challenge continued because there was a claim for individual damages from the park manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.797" offset="1464643">So in order to determine that individual claim for damages, of course, the plaintiffs could have put in evidence that, in fact, rather than just as a preliminary prediction, the injunction was issued to prevent content-based discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.788" offset="1536532">I mean in many of these cases you have fairly elaborate proceedings over the preliminary injunction and the event takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.254" offset="1562446">I would not want to get to a situation where people feel the need to artificially keep a case alive simply to ensure their entitlement to attorney's fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.436" offset="1643216">And at the point at which you only have a preliminary injunction, no matter how long that preliminary injunction has been in effect, what you have is a prediction of success on the merits, a balancing of equitable factors that determine interim fairness, but you do not have a decision that the defendant has violated the Constitution or any Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.139" offset="4825976">This Court, while repeatedly stating, including unanimously just two years ago, that the central justification for attorney's fees is that the defendant is a violator of Federal law, has found that it will also permit attorney's fees in the consent decree situation, but that's because there you have a defendant who is not fighting and continuing to resist any form of final relief, has instead agreed to provide final relief that runs to a plaintiff, in favor of a plaintiff, and that advances the purpose of Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.679" offset="4956170">Can't the parties... it seems to me an exception that isn't consistent with the theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.215" offset="4978322">Why can't the parties just agree on attorney's fees in the settlement agreement and the consent decree and then it wouldn't have to be an issue?</text>

            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Millett</label>
            <text syncTime="1211.647" offset="5004026">I think, I think that in reality certainly a party can say, I'm not entering into a consent decree if we're not going to resolve attorney's fees now or if we're going to have a fight over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.444" offset="5043210">So they certainly have that power because it's largely a contract, although one enforced by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.998" offset="5061391">I'm only trying to be candid with this Court's precedent, which is also recognized in Mayer versus Gagne.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.143" offset="5085946">For some reason, maybe they reserved the question there to be disputed in court whether you'd be responsible for attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.085" offset="5105799">But I do think That's much more of a side show because that can all be dealt with through the contract elements of the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.469" offset="5131295">And really what you're talking about when a court is coercively imposing attorney's fees on a defendant is that the defendant has a right to not pay those unless they have been found to be a violator of Federal law or have agreed to through contract to deal with that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1257.571" offset="5187719">Okay, but the argument is undercut, as you yourself say, by the settlement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.612" offset="5203915">Don't we have the settlement rule simply because we want to promote settlements?</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.817" offset="5224709">We don't want litigation to go on and on and on simply because somebody wants to establish a right to attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.414" offset="5267132">And doesn't that same reasoning apply here when there is a preliminary injunction and that's all the person wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.079" offset="5301718">By the same reasoning that we accept a settlement, why shouldn't we accept a preliminary injunction as being a sufficient determination of rights to justify fees because we don't want it to go on and on and on when nobody has any issue of substance involved, but is just litigating for the sake of establishing a right to fees later?</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.443" offset="13551187">And it was consistent with the stipulation they had entered into that her nudity was protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.846" offset="13572816">So again, she was certainly entitled to negotiate as she tried to do with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.398" offset="13599043">She was told one week before that she wouldn't be allowed to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.593" offset="13611791">She went to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.281" offset="13614508">She got the very relief that she sought and she was able to protest in the nude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.816" offset="13632689">Now in the other cases, you're going to get someone who just finds they were denied the right to register or to get on the ballot, and that's going to be disposed of immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.334" offset="13678769">It won't be capable of repetition by evading review because the person is now registered, the election is now over.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.928" offset="13709176">So we have a whole core of First Amendment cases that will be affected if Petitioner's per se rule that preliminary injunction is never enough goes into play, because then States have the unfortunate incentive of pushing the decisions very close to the actual event deadline so that even if they lose in court, they won't have to pay attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.011" offset="13801440">And I would add that in terms of the broader notion, here we have a midlevel state official sending a letter to an individual saying we don't think you have any First Amendment rights, and if you come, you'll be violating a law that's subject to criminal arrest, if you come and you're naked, you're going to be subject to criminal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.576" offset="13883778">Absent Section 1998, it would be incredibly difficult for persons in Ms. Wyner's situation to find attorneys.</text>

            <text syncTime="3452.960" offset="13969251">The plaintiffs were awarded costs incurred on the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.265" offset="13990462">My client was awarded a right to costs on the remainder of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.416" offset="14015122">Those costs were reduced to mirror the precise costs that the plaintiff was awarded on preliminary injunction, so in the end no one received any costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.453" offset="14051275">But costs were allocated for plaintiffs for the preliminary injunction, and defendants for the remainder of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.158" offset="14078025">I just want to make one point about the timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.241" offset="14094429">The time prior to the 2003 demonstration, in 2000 she wrote a letter requesting the right to protest nude and received a denial letter in response, similar to the one she received in 2003.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.068" offset="14145734">So she was on notice as of 2000 that we were enforcing the nudity ban against her activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.321" offset="14170707">Second, I want to say that the district court itself characterized its holding on summary judgment, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.967" offset="14197247">"as plaintiffs are unable to show actual success on the merits. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.240" offset="14214384">page 34a of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.842" offset="14224833">So there's no doubt that what even the court understood its own holding to be was that the prediction in the preliminary injunction had failed to materialize when the court considered the full case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.500" offset="14271435">And finally, I want to say that awarding fees, conferring fees for a plaintiff for obtaining a preliminary injunction essentially requires the State treasury to pay its opponents when, in fact, the State has done nothing but enforce a valid law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.591" offset="14331830">And we know that in this case because the case ended up getting litigated to conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.682" offset="14352101">But simply because we don't know that in other cases involving preliminary injunctions doesn't mean it isn't true, and that's why it's fundamentally unfair to impose fees on State defendants and local governments that haven't had a full and fair opportunity to defend their legal position.</text>
