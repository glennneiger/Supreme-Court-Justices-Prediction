            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="154547">We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 06-562, United States versus Atlantic Research Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.578" offset="188820">Mr. Hungar.</text>

            <text syncTime="9.648" offset="193104">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.370" offset="207941">In Section 113(f) of CERCLA, Congress created a precisely drawn detailed mechanism for potentially responsible parties to recover their response costs from other PRPs.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.297" offset="255693">Respondent seeks to circumvent the limitations that Congress imposed on that remedy by manufacturing a parallel mechanism for contribution-like relief under Section 107.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.476" offset="304385">Respondent's theory should be rejected because it violates fundamental canons of statutory construction, renders Section 113(f) superfluous, makes a mockery of the textual limitations enforced by this Court in Cooper Industries, and would frustrate Congress's clear intent to encourage settlements with the government in order to achieve supervised effective cleanups.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.311" offset="395709">Respondent essentially asks this Court to create a shadow contribution scheme under the guise of Section 107(a) by borrowing all of the features of the Section 113(f) remedy except the one that Respondent can't satisfy, namely the requirement that contribution be sought only during or following a civil action or settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.654" offset="485153">Mr. Hungar, was this Court wrong in your view, it wasn't dispositive of the case in Key Tronic when it said,</text>
            <text syncTime="91.412" offset="520157">"Section 107 unquestionably provides a cause of action for private parties to seek recovery of cleanup costs? "</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="101.357" offset="559967">Your Honor, we agree that Section 107(a)(1) through (4)(b), subparagraph (b) creates a cause of action for private parties, in particular the private parties who are not PRPs, who are therefore other persons other than the PRPs who are the subject of that statutory sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.269" offset="639589">So we agree in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.042" offset="646694">We don't think it creates a cause of action for the particular private parties who are trying to sue in this case, that is PRPs.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.091" offset="702909">Well, in Key Tronic, obviously the Court was facing a different question so I don't think it was trying to in any way authoritatively resolve this issue, as the Court held in Cooper Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.107" offset="742929">But I... certainly there is language in Cooper... excuse me, in Key Tronic that can be read to suggest that the Court assumed or thought there was some sort of remedy for PRPs.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.163" offset="783158">It's not clear whether it was referring to contribution or some other remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.856" offset="797891">But in Cooper Industries, the Court made clear that that was dicta and that's in our view correct, because the Court in Key Tronic was faced with a different question altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="2138.860" offset="8709963">And I think that was true in 1980 when the statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.343" offset="8735876">Contrary to the Government's representation, there are 10 cases holding that actions may be brought under 107(a)(4)(b) by so-called PRPs between the time that CERCLA was passed in 1980 and the amendment to CERCLA in 1986, in October of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.837" offset="8805884">Courts held without exception, without exception, that covered persons or PRPs indeed do have a right to bring a cost recovery action under 107(a)(4)(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.294" offset="8859696">And Congress when it passed 113, was looking at those cases only that had some doubt about whether contribution could also be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.031" offset="8898671">In other words, whether a party could seek restitution despite the fact that it was compelled to do a cleanup via a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.885" offset="8922077">And some courts found that there was an implied right to contribution, some found that there was a common law right, but Congress in 1986 specifically said, we are only concerned with the implied right to contribution, given this Court's holding in the Northwest Airlines case and in Texas Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.034" offset="8986651">Congress was concerned that there would be no right to contribution unless it codified that right, which it did in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.950" offset="9018312">And I think the legislative history makes it quite clear that Congress did not intend to disturb or to cut back on the rights that courts had found consistently in that six-year window between 1980 and 1986, all of which held that PRPs indeed do have a right to bring cost recovery actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.735" offset="10141473">And the Government says well, the insertion of the word other prior to the enactment of CERCLA indicates that what Congress intended was to withdraw from that huge basket, if you will, all PRPs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.043" offset="10190687">Well, that is not the case at all, because initially the definition section of person that was contained in the initial draft of CERCLA did not include the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2722.416" offset="11044160">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.978" offset="11050429">There are more than 400,000 sites across the country that are contaminated by hazardous wastes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.542" offset="11072686">The amici States recognize that if these sites are to be cleaned up, it's going to take the work of private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.135" offset="11095047">In turn, we recognize that private parties rely upon cost recovery to obtain their costs and financial incentives to do the site cleanup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.248" offset="11123468">The United States argument ignores this vast majority of sites that do not have the opportunity of litigation and do not have the opportunity of settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.316" offset="11155755">I'll turn first to the words "any other person" where the United States argues that it means innocent person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.617" offset="11180937">The words 107 of CERCLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.071" offset="11198805">To get there, the United States borrows from other sections of CERCLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.854" offset="11213956">If the word other were superfluous... and we do not think it is, we do not think that's the right reading... the better textual reading here is the natural reading of Section 107.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.233" offset="11259409">These are two sections that are practically twins and if words are known by the company they keep, you have three parallel structures in each of these cost recovery sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.270" offset="11295563">And further, we point out that the Government's argument leads to an implausible result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.861" offset="11313953">If people have to prove their innocence in order to qualify for a cost recovery claim, then there would be, indeed, a possible multiyear trial just in order to decide whether they had a right to cost recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.679" offset="11361182">A far better approach would be not to destroy a cost recovery claim after that work but to allow those issues, that is a plaintiff's potential liability under 107, to be raised as a contribution counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.738" offset="11417398">And that way you have an incentive for settlement between that private plaintiff and the defendants, and that way you have equity being done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.543" offset="11444669">Why wouldn't the States prefer to proceed, to force people to proceed under 113, so that the States would have, you know, a hand in deciding how the cleanup should go?</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.031" offset="11498586">I don't... I don't quite understand why you're here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.827" offset="11533799">The States recognize that to proceed under settlement puts a near impossible task.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.871" offset="11557936">EPA, of course, can settle very few sites, they have limited resources, and that's one of the reasons why we don't have settlements in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.965" offset="11582387">And apparently they sometimes have disincentives for proceeding with a settlement because it would open the Government to a contribution claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.380" offset="11607987">The States also have similar resource limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.782" offset="11621675">The States in order to go into a settlement, and this is an important point, the Government is blurring the State settlement right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.468" offset="11648320">It's referring to a cost recovery right which the States could seek under Section 107 of CERCLA, but there's a great deal of uncertainty as to whether a State settlement that orders a cleanup would be a resolution of CERCLA liability, and a Second Circuit case from Con Edison that's pending before this Court discusses that at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.290" offset="11723657">Uncertainty does not drive settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.982" offset="11734420">You asked a question, Justice Scalia, about other reasons why there are incentives for settlement, and I'd point out a third, fourth and fifth one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.267" offset="11767543">One, you do get to settle your claims that the Government is bringing against you, which is a powerful incentive to settle, to have peace with the Government in certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.094" offset="11798890">And then a further point is that you get no better remedy necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.855" offset="11813936">There is no reason to walk away from the settlement with the Government, and I don't believe the Government can point to any examples where people have walked away from settlements in order to pursue 107 claims, because 107 doesn't necessarily lead to a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.093" offset="11862838">If you're a liable person or potentially liable person, you're going to see your defendants raise your liability and they are going to interpose a cross-claim under Section 113.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.590" offset="12088849">Any person may seek contribution from... and this is at 67a of the petition, and I believe it's 9a or 11a of the U.S. brief... any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under Section 107 during or following the 107 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.312" offset="12159693">A 113 action supplements the 107 action that the government is so concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.495" offset="12180487">Turning then to the question that this would bypass contribution protection: As a threshold matter, that is an issue that is rooted in the language of Section 113(f)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.335" offset="12247883">It is not a signal as to how to interpret Section 107 itself, because there are a host of potential 107 actions that might come to bear that the United States admits to and those actions could equally be posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.635" offset="12301068">But more importantly perhaps is that because any person who does a settlement with the Government would raise their settlement either as a defense or as a counterclaim, as my colleague said, the court would have the authority under 113(f)(1), the third sentence, there to allocate and apportion responsibility among all liable persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.655" offset="12377136">And at that point, if it had been a judicial settlement that would be very strong evidence that you had paid your proportionate share to the site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.903" offset="12410155">Furthermore, what the Government is overlooking is the settlements, there are a number of checks and balances on settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.426" offset="12432203">This is not a real world problem that the Government describing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.089" offset="12446831">The matters addressed, provision of the settlement that the EPA very carefully crafts, doesn't overreach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.832" offset="12473789">Occasionally it will, but when it does address an entire cleanup at a site that signals that the EPA is going to be in control of the cleanup for the remainder of the site and you're not going to have unknown parties coming in and entering a site.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.002" offset="12526452">To do so would be in fact inconsistent with the national contingency plan and you would never make the elements of proving consistency with the national contingency plan in triggering a 107 right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3124.781" offset="12653616">State law is certainly a possibility there and that would of course be a stronger indicator that you could give a broader reading to contribution protection under (f)(2) and that's what several courts have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.909" offset="12698129">But the scope of whether a State law meets contribution protection has been debated in the courts and it's of course not before us today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.433" offset="12724251">In the end, the last and most important point is that the Government's construction not only bars cost recovery from potentially liable persons even an innocent person who reads Section 107 would not step forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.677" offset="12805231">If you touch a site and you begin operating and moving waste... and Mr. Chief Justice, your hypothetical about a do-gooder organization that might come in and do cleanups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.623" offset="12844937">There is a good likelihood that they would be receiving a counterclaim that would say that they had operated the site and become a liable party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.647" offset="12869074">And that could litigate for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.149" offset="12879105">So in the end, in the end of the case, the United States leaves no incentive for private cost recovery and there are 400,000 sites that do need cleanup, and Congress did contemplate there would be two cause of actions, one under 107 for cost recovery when people had incurred costs, and the other one would be for contribution when people had been sued or had settled their civil suit liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3277.603" offset="13264882">Your Honor, the point is that the settlement bar under their interpretation is either eviscerated, as Respondents amici argue, or that's the position that they take, that they want to be able to sue for cost recovery and evade the settlement bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.213" offset="13315350">Respondent of course doesn't make that argument because they don't have to in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.922" offset="13330188">But unless the Court imports the settlement bar into cost recovery actions, there's going to be this huge problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.650" offset="13377104">So previously, whether the cases were split or not, there was... your best argument for the proposition that 107(a) does not permit suit did not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="3345.518" offset="13536555">But, Your Honor, the point is it was not clear in 1986 what this language meant and what the extent of the PRP rights were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.413" offset="13568111">Congress addressed that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.075" offset="13574798">There is not a hint of a suggestion in the legislative history that Congress was recognizing a PRP action under 107 independent of Section 113.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.500" offset="13616490">Congress spoke to the question of PRP's suing and the only way it spoke to it explicitly was in Section 113.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.164" offset="13639164">When Congress says that, this Court has said over and over again that when Congress speaks in an area of uncertainty, as in Fausto, as in Brock against North Dakota, as in the State of Vermont, is where the prior asserted right was not clearly established, was not authoritatively recognized, it's not an implied repeal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.696" offset="13709277">It's a question of reconciling the statutes in a way that gives effect to the later statutes, a more specific statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.630" offset="13732996">Which as here, Section 113, their interpretation gives effect to part of it because they say oh well, let's borrow a settlement bar to make it all work, but you can't do... you can't do it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.094" offset="13766851">The Court rejected that very same approach in the Rancho Palos Verdes case from a couple of terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.529" offset="13788585">We agree that you need to borrow the limitations of Section 113(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.880" offset="13802064">You just need to borrow all of them, including the one that they can't satisfy, which is that Congress said for suits by PRP's against PRP's, just like is normally the case among joint tort feasors, it's a contribution suit and they have to wait for a law suit or for a settlement, or some discharge of the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.142" offset="13867056">And that also avoids burdening the courts with the extremely time-consuming and costly and difficult question of assessing whether the NCP has been complied with, whether the costs comply with the national contingency plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.231" offset="13915435">Because if they settled, then the expert agency has already had a chance to address that and the court doesn't need to get into it in anywhere near the same detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.804" offset="13945737">Their approach is a recipe for burdening the Federal courts with claims that Congress did not clearly indicate should be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.998" offset="13970501">If States want to provide contribution actions that allow these sorts of claims they can, and many States have done so, including Washington State, which is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.004" offset="13998505">So parties can bring these claims in State court if they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.956" offset="14010312">They can get settlements from the States if they want to and are willing to pay the costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.078" offset="14022851">So the burdens that they identify are not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.229" offset="14031419">Implied repeal does not apply here and because of the uncertainty, as we indicated at pages 9 through 10 of our reply brief and footnote 5, there was no unanimous widespread consensus among the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.046" offset="14074678">This just hasn't come up very much, and the courts were divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.987" offset="14086485">I'd also like to address... thank you.</text>
