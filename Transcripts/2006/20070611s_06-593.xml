            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="89887">Second case Long Island Care versus Coke that has to do with the Federal Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.296" offset="126981">The Fair Labor Standards Act which has to do with maximum hours and minimum wages and in 1974 Congress amended the act so the domestic workers fell within the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.402" offset="179435">But at that time, it made an exception for domestic sub-workers who provide companionship services for individuals who because of age or infirmity are unable to take care of themselves and then in the statute there is a parenthetical and it says, “as such terms are defined and delimited by secretary of labor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="48.439" offset="283611">Now within a year I think in 1975, the secretary promulgated some regulations and they said among lots of other things that “these companionship workers who are looking after old people or sick people and who are not covered by the minimum wage laws is their exempt” they include not only those who are employed by the old sick person but also those who are employed by agencies or third parties that’s called the “Third Party Regulation” and more recently that regulation has turned out to be very controversial and the department from time to time has considered changing it or withdrawing it but it never has.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.051" offset="450063">Now, in this case the domestic companionship worker who was paid by a third party, claims that the regulation which in fact exempts her from the Minimum Wage Law is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.192" offset="506592">Now she doesn’t have that easier job with her case because the statute says, that the “secretary of labor and delimit the terms of the exception.”</text>
            <text syncTime="114.350" offset="547239">In other parts it gives the secretary lots of regulation righting authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.226" offset="566778">But she makes them pretty good arguments, there are four basic arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.410" offset="583497">She says, “The regulation falls outside the scope of the acts delegation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="129.945" offset="609619">She says, “It conflicts with a different regulation it can’t prompt at other regulation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="136.650" offset="636473">She says, “This is listed in a section called interpretations so it must be an interpretive regulation which we shouldn’t pay that much attention to” and she says, “The department failed to follow proper procedures when it promulgated the regulation 30 years ago.”</text>
            <text syncTime="153.983" offset="705750">Now the second circuit accepted some of these arguments but we, while we think they are good arguments they are not quite good enough and we find them not convincing, and we setout our reasons in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.045" offset="757995">Now since those reasons are quite technical in nature I shall spare you a recitation of them and I will leave those with a keen interest in administrative law and labor law to read the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.032" offset="814001">So, we reverse the Second Circuit and the opinion is unanimous.</text>
