            <text syncTime="64.714" offset="419322">But the question is, you say the PTO has recognized that it issued this patent, that it's an invalid issuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.498" offset="450460">So why aren't they curing their own mistakes, never mind what a court is going to do?</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Dabney</label>
            <text syncTime="77.561" offset="470731">Well, there is the possibility of director-initiated re-examination of patents as certainly an administrative remedy that does exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.616" offset="502914">But where a case is in pending litigation such as this, the traditional way that these disputes are resolved is for a court to apply the law to the facts and render a judgment on a defense of invalidity which has been pleaded to the plaintiff's claim of patent infringement in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.868" offset="575952">This issue arises in the context of a defense pleaded to a claim for patent infringement and I'm not sure that the Patent Office really could swoop in and cut off the plaintiff's claim in the manner Your Honor is suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.125" offset="620988">The Federal Circuit in this case applied the approach it's applied in previous cases, which is a categorical approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.264" offset="665500">The Federal Circuit says that no matter what might be the nature of an alleged invention or improvement, no matter how broad might be a claim made in an issued patent, no matter how small might be the difference between a patent claim and prior art, and no matter how modest might have been the degree of skill needed to devise subject matter described by a patent claim, the Federal Circuit says regardless of any or all of that a court of the United States can never, ever sustain a defense of invalidity under Section 103 of the Patent Act except in a very limited and narrowly defined circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.009" offset="824534">That circumstance is a record that includes clear and convincing evidence, that yields a jury verdict or specific finding showing what the Federal Circuit calls a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine prior art teachings in the particular manner claimed by the patent at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.309" offset="893706">The decision in this case treats Section 103 not, as this Court has said, as a codification of a condition for patentability whose benchmark is skill and ingenuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.699" offset="939263">The decision in this case treats section 1 as implementing a supposed entitlement to patent protection that a court--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="204.384" offset="978029">We're talking about what the law should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.656" offset="991090">Would you make, be making the same argument if we were looking at the most recent decisions of the Federal Circuit, the ones that they issued within the year, and each as I remember they held that the patent was obvious and therefore invalid?</text>
            <text syncTime="230.122" offset="1080952">Suppose we were dealing in what was, the cases were, what were they, Kahn, Alpha, and Diestar?</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Dabney</label>
            <text syncTime="237.947" offset="1112194">Your Honor, what the Federal Circuit has done in recent times has been after a certiorari was granted in this case to erect a series of escape devices from what is otherwise a categorical test that must be imposed in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.848" offset="1175828">As a practical matter the Federal Circuit still characterizes as an issue of fact for determination by a jury the presence or absence of teaching, suggestion, or motivation, and so these seemingly remedial steps that have been taken by the Federal Circuit do not materially affect the problem that's praised by this case, which is the well nigh impossibility nowadays of being able to have an efficient, inexpensive, quick and predictable determination of whether claimed subject matter meets the statutory standard.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="286.427" offset="1306127">But what is the difference between asking whether something is implicit in the, in the prior art and simply asking whether it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art?</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Dabney</label>
            <text syncTime="300.888" offset="1364014">The statute and this Court's precedents make the benchmark of patentability skill, what degree of skill is needed to devise subject matter in respect to an objectively defined problem, objective looking at the claim and looking at the prior art?</text>
            <text syncTime="315.856" offset="1423887">What the Federal Circuit is talking about now is an inquiry into motivation, not skill.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.671" offset="1443113">Those two are very different concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.691" offset="1451263">There is not a word in this Court's precedents that says that whether a patent should be granted or not depends on whether a hypothetical person had hypothetical motivation to do what everybody knows he could do.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="333.020" offset="1492537">Of course, the reason that the Federal Circuit has devised this additional test or gloss on Graham is that they say obviousness is, it's deceptive in hindsight.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.596" offset="1538826">In hindsight everybody says, I could have thought of that; and that you need... if you don't have the sort of constraint that their test imposes, it's going to be too easy to say that everything was obvious.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_w_dabney" startTime="357.995" stopTime="446.723">
            <label>Mr. James W. Dabney</label>
            <text syncTime="357.995" offset="1592429">Well, the Court, Mr. Chief Justice, the Court needs to be very clear what is meant by the term "hindsight".</text>
            <text syncTime="364.590" offset="1618761">If by hindsight is meant looking at what's claimed now, the subject matter sought to be patented, and comparing that to the prior art, to call that analytical process improper hindsight is to make a frontal assault on the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.629" offset="1671005">If by hindsight means to posit a desired result, a clay doorknob, and to ask whether more skill and ingenuity than were required by ordinary skill in the art was needed to do that, to say that that constitutes improper hindsight is to make a frontal assault on the entire body of this Court's precedents construing section 103 and its common law predecessors.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.421" offset="1758150">With regard to the kind of bias Your Honor is talking about, this Court's precedents provide a wealth of mechanisms for protecting against that, including the statement towards the end of the Graham opinion, which is the only source of the word "hindsight" that I've seen cited in the amici brief, which was a discussion of the secondary consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.344" offset="1829830">So that in a case like Goodyear against Rayovac there's an excellent case where the claimed subject matter seems so simple in hindsight.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.618" offset="1862953">This was a case decided by this Court in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.452" offset="1874238">A leakproof battery that had been a problem that had defied solution for years and there was all kinds of motivation to solve it, and the fact that it was not solved was considered important by this Court in sustaining the validity of the patent in that case, which claimed nothing more than a sheet metal sheath wrapped around the electrodes and materials generated in the battery.</text>

            <text syncTime="920.137" offset="3840945">Here's the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.208" offset="3845229">What's shown in the figures of the Engelgau patent is an adjustable pedal assembly that has a large bore tube from which you suspended a pedal arm on a yoke, and it slides back and forth along the tube.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.785" offset="3891623">And that's the way that it provides for adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.866" offset="3899877">And in claims 1, 2 and 3 some of that structure is recited.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.058" offset="3912730">So those claims would not necessarily be invalid by the Asano reference because the Asana adjustment mechanism doesn't use a tube, and doesn't use a yoke; it uses pins and slots and it provides adjustment by a different mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.525" offset="3958601">The respondents have not asserted claims 1, 2 and 3 in this case because those claims don't describe anything remotely like the petitioner's pedals.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.130" offset="3984932">They limited their claim to claim 4 because only by claiming this enormous verbal abstraction that is claim 4 can they make a colorable claim of patent infringement against the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.950" offset="4036237">So I would respectfully submit that the Court does not need to decide whether 1, 2 or 3 would be valid but the point would be, the question would be what we did in the Hotchkiss case or in the Anderson's-Black Rock case or any of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.936" offset="4088168">Would it have required more than ordinary skill to devise that claim structure with those additional structural limitations to solve some objectively defined problem, and that hasn't been litigated or briefed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1116.259" offset="4625454">In fact in Graham itself, in the Sakraida case, in Dann against Johnston, lower courts had held patents valid because of a lack of suggestion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.336" offset="5465761">And in addition I would point out that this Court in Sakraida provided a framework for assessing patents like this one, where each of the elements is set forth in the prior art and each of the elements in the claimed invention is merely performing its already known, previously known function as set forth in the prior art.</text>

            <text syncTime="1349.524" offset="5558548">It isn't just the Federal Circuit that has been applying this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.547" offset="5570669">It's also the Patent Office and it's been following the Federal Circuit's test for 20 years or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.089" offset="5596792">What, what is... assuming that we sweep that test aside and say it's been incorrect, what happens to the presumption of validity of, of patents which the courts have been, have been traditionally applying?</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.710" offset="5659277">Does it make any sense to presume that patents are valid which have been issued under an erroneous test for the last 20 years?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Hungar</label>
            <text syncTime="1383.996" offset="5696475">Your Honor, I think that it would make sense because the statute requires it, and as a practical matter it shouldn't make any difference, because the only category of cases in which the result would change under our test is the category in which as a matter of law, in light of the factual issues that are required under Graham, as a matter of law the Court concludes that the difference between the claimed invention and the prior art is so trivial that it cannot be given the protection of a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.282" offset="5801592">And in those circumstances the presumption doesn't come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.675" offset="5815175">It's a legal determination; the presumption has been understood to effect the burden of proof, and in the Federal Circuit's view the measure of the burden of proof requiring clear and convincing evidence on the underlying factual considerations, not the ultimate legal determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.714" offset="5871286">But one of the problems with the Federal Circuit's test is that it transforms what this Court made clear in Graham is supposed to be a legal determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.669" offset="5903156">Ultimately it transforms it into a jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.051" offset="5916635">Because in a case like this one where you have as conclusory affidavits from respondent's experts saying</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.497" offset="5946414">"oh, this would not have been obvious. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.766" offset="5951534">And that in the Court of Appeals view is enough to create a jury question and then you then have to roll the dice in front of a jury in each one of these cases, except of course the many cases in which the challenger can't meet the teaching suggestion motivation test at all and simply is unable to challenge the validity of the patent, notwithstanding this Court's holding in Graham that it's ultimately a legal determination... admittedly one informed by detailed factual inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.265" offset="6053517">Another problem with the Federal Circuit's test is that it devalues and de-emphasizes the statutory focus and this Court's focus in Graham on the capabilities of the person of ordinary skill.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.723" offset="6163335">We were simply attempting to describe in perhaps imprecise terms the holding of this Court in Graham, and the holding of this Court in Graham is that the ultimate inquiry for the court, obviously suggestion, teaching, motivation, teaching a way in the prior art, all of these are factual, subsidiary factual issues that will shed light and a great deal of light on the ultimate question in each particular case, but ultimately the question for the court is whether in light of all those underlying factual showings the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are sufficient to, that they would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.347" offset="6313801">And that ultimately is a legal determination, you can refer to that as sufficiently innovative to justify a patent, but the ultimate question, the ultimate test is the one set forth in the statute and in the Graham decision.</text>

Mr. Asano himself, I would think at some point when the Ford company decides to switch to electronic throttles, of course will have every motivation in the world to do precisely what your client did, because he can't use that thing that pulls back and forth anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.434" offset="8698153">Rather, he has to get a little electronic cap and attach it to something that moves in fixed proportion to the accelerator going up and down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.360" offset="13177840">The second is the reason given by the PTO in its brief in this case and that is you wouldn't put it on the pin that would render Engelgau obvious.</text>

            <text syncTime="3267.961" offset="13232279">What I want to make clear is two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.994" offset="13240429">The first is, though the Federal Circuit has in recent opinions been quite emphatic about how inclusive its test is, it has consistently cited earlier Federal Circuit precedent and said that the other side and the people who claimed that their standard is too narrow and misguided are mischaracterizing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.496" offset="13310437">And the second is, the judgment in this case quite explicitly acknowledges and implies the implicit teaching, suggestion, motivation standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.690" offset="13343247">So I don't want you to have the mistaken impression that there has been some radical change in Federal Circuit law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.133" offset="13364981">But no matter what one thinks about the differential between Federal Circuit law today and Federal Circuit law a year ago or two years ago, there is a quite considerable cost by articulating a desire to head off in a new direction, because there will be dramatic instability in the patent system, the incalculable investments that underlie current patents.</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.868" offset="14347917">As someone who tries patent cases, there is no legal regime that is a greater generator of patent litigation than the teaching suggestion motivation test that is urged by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.876" offset="14403923">Where in this unbelievable situation where, in the District Court, this Court's precedents were cited, were not followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.872" offset="14431926">In the Court of Appeals, this Court's precedents in Anderson's-Black Rock and others were cited, not distinguished, followed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.876" offset="14455959">If the law of this Court had been applied in the District Court I wouldn't be standing here right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.662" offset="14479051">The reason that we have this, this proceeding going on is because of this extraordinary situation, where notwithstanding that this Court has issued precedents in a variety of circumstances dealing with multiple technologies, lots of different kinds of differences, lots of different kinds of alleged innovation, they are simply not paid attention to in the corpus of the Federal Circuit's case law up until about a month ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.615" offset="14574868">So the, this Court could do no greater service to the actual process of determining whether claimed subject matter does and does not comply with the statute than to decide with case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.086" offset="14628785">The worst possible thing that can happen in this case is for the case not to end here, and for the Court not to provide a precedent as it has done in so many particular past cases, and give the public an example of a particular claim and a particular difference that does not meet the standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3718.570" offset="15034728">What the statute calls for, Justice Kennedy, is not to focus on a particular subjective problem like fitting into a Ford F 350, or particular difference between a prior art pedal that provides wire chafing and a claimed invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.352" offset="15101810">The law has always required that the patentability be determined by the smallest amount of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.556" offset="15130650">So if it were true that there was wire chafing, that that was a problem that would have had to have been overcome, if you started with a prior art pedal that, that provided for wires to move... well then, maybe that combination would not make the claimed subject matter obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.107" offset="15192925">But that would not foreclose the defendant from saying well, this other technology over here that doesn't suffer from that problem, it's a simple matter to modify that, so the premise of the question, that because there is some other potential combination that might have been, might have been more difference or less reason to modify it than the one that's relied on by the petitioner, is legally not material to the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.633" offset="15286966">So I respectfully submit that the... I really have to emphasize this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.567" offset="15310685">I mean, this is a litigation between, you know, two real businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.720" offset="15331374">The justified expectations, Justice Souter that I think this Court has recognized over and over again, are the expectations of real innovators, who make real products and have real inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.657" offset="15379126">And... and I think it would come as a great surprise to the owner of the Asano patent to find as Justice Breyer suggested, that in order to supply it to a modern vehicle maker it would have to pay tribute to the Engelgau patent.</text>
