            <text syncTime="13.040" offset="205892">The per se illegality rule for resale price maintenance is widely recognized to be outdated, misguided and anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.036" offset="249883">It should be replaced with the same rule of reason standard that applies to other forms of vertically imposed marketing restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.691" offset="284469">The Sherman Act bars only unreasonable restraints of trade and the court presumptively applies a rule of reason analysis to determine whether a restraint is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.961" offset="337550">Per se rules should be rare and imposed only where the court is virtually certain based upon considerable economic experience that a practice is nearly invariably anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.312" offset="398990">Vertical minimum retail... resale price maintenance are plainly not invariably anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.299" offset="434934">In fact, a broad consensus of economists and decisions of this Court recognize that vertical restraints promote interbrand competition, which is the goal of the antitrust laws and are rarely, if ever, anticompetitive.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="86.989" offset="501703">There was an argument made, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context, that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made with the dealers was more successful in getting a horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers had attempted it themselves, in which case some might have held back.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.979" offset="617582">Well, the economists who have looked at the use of resale price maintenance have said that that would very rarely, if ever, be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.624" offset="652168">It certainly could not be the case in this industry in connection with this participant in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.481" offset="683620">There are something like 5,000 dealers that the Brighton products are sold through.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.614" offset="704204">There are thousands and thousands of other competing dealers, hundreds of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.077" offset="726043">What the Court has said repeatedly is that programs such as this may promote interbrand competition, perhaps--</text>

            <text syncTime="151.022" offset="757808">Mr. Olson, suppose just the dealers in New York, the retail dealers agreed among themselves on the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.078" offset="786020">Would that be lawful?</text>

            <text syncTime="179.822" offset="872955">Why should that be any different from the arrangement where those dealers all got together in the convention and recommended to the manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of precisely the same dimensions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="203.367" offset="967205">--Because the motivation for the arrangement, if it comes from a manufacturer... you're suggesting a hypothetical in which all of the dealers in a particular area would get together to impose this on a manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.986" offset="1017674">I think it's very unrealistic that that would happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.409" offset="1031362">They just passed a resolution asking the manufacturer to impose this vertical restraint and ways to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.412" offset="1051319">Should that be different from one in which the manufacturer does it independently?</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="228.394" offset="1067306">I think that if the manufacturer makes a decision, whether it's because dealers would like to see that happen or not, as this Court said in Business Electronic versus Sharp Electronics, there's of course relationships between the dealers and the manufacturers, that the dealers may have an interest in doing this, because they may find for the same reason that the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.169" offset="1158421">The record is clear in this case that this was an effective strategy for the Brighton company, the Brighton Leegin company that's manufacturing the Brighton products, to enter a very difficult and highly competitive marketplace, and it was successful.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.276" offset="1250790">Well, it might be a situation, the economists have written about this, say that it would be very rare, and would require retailers with a strong powerful market power to impose a situation where the manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a horizontal cartel.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.058" offset="1337935">That certainly was not involved in this case, and that would probably be found to violate the rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.363" offset="1363117">In addition, it would probably be unlawful under the horizontal rules established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.747" offset="1388717">That was not an issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1059.872" offset="4393216">Now those three sets of things require a balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.433" offset="4407427">And we have a hundred years of history where this Court and Congress and others have balanced those three sets of considerations, and they've come out one way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.087" offset="4790069">But the empirical data that are available would suggest that anticompetitive explanations for resale price maintenance do not have very much explanatory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.775" offset="4832805">When you actually look at the cases that have been litigated, they involve manufacturers without market power, unconcentrated markets, no evidence in the vast majority of those cases of any cartelization going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.353" offset="4879094">So the anticompetitive explanations, while certainly valid in some cases, do not appear to explain most of the resale price maintenance that has been litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.710" offset="4912531">It's true that resale price maintenance can but does not always result in price increases, but, as Justice Scalia pointed out, price is not the only thing that consumers care about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.398" offset="4959342">And there is widespread consensus in the economic literature and in this Court's recent cases that price-based vertical restraints, just like non-price based vertical restraints, while they generally reduce intrabrand competition, generally enhance interbrand competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.553" offset="11839891">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.394" offset="11851280">When a manufacturer agrees with its retailers to fix a minimum resale price, the whole point of the agreement is to prevent price competition among retailers, to prevent discounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.202" offset="11898510">For almost 100 years the Court has interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman Act to prohibit such price fixing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.687" offset="11924423">Any change in that fundamental understanding of the statute should be made by Congress and not by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.801" offset="11952949">The per se rule against resale price maintenance is different in at least three ways from other antitrust rules that this Court has overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.848" offset="11985132">First, unlike the other rules, it alone has been settled law for a century, reaffirmed over and over again by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2967.454" offset="12023479">Well, it's also been settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more inefficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.029" offset="12061827">Doesn't it make sense to allow them to adopt the most efficient means to an end that is already completely legal?</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.444" offset="12087427">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.844" offset="12089099">That tension that you... that supposed anomaly that you described is simply a result of the fact that the antitrust rule... law does not prohibit all anticompetitive behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.702" offset="12140508">It prohibits agreements that are anti... that restrain competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.226" offset="12158585">And so it will often be the case that it is possible for somebody unilaterally to do something that has the same effect as an agreement, or approximately the same effect, as the antitrust law simply draws that line because of a different value, a value in preserving--</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.975" offset="12225563">the independent action of individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.158" offset="12246356">Give me some other examples where you can achieve the same industry-wide effect unilaterally.</text>

            <label>Ms. Barbara D. Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="3030.374" offset="12275195">--Well, as you have observed, virtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished by having the manufacturer integrate the retailing function and become one entity instead of two entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.654" offset="12336322">Then the possibility of conspiracy or agreement is eliminated and the manufacturer, if he simply integrates the whole function, is... can fix prices, fix his, what are in effect his own prices and be outside the reach of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.264" offset="12394732">There are other reasons why a manufacturer might not find it convenient to do that integration, but it is certainly possible by ceasing to be multiple entities and to become one entity to avoid the prohibitions of the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.792" offset="12448857">It is also... so, this is old and well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.168" offset="12470382">Unlike the Schwinn rule against territorial restraints which was overturned only 10 years after it was established, or the Albrecht rule against maximum resale price maintenance which was overturned 29 years after it was established, this has a much more settled pedigree in the law and expectations have grown up around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.819" offset="12557004">Second, it was endorsed and relied on by Congress, not enacted by Congress but endorsed and relied on by Congress, when Congress repealed the fair trade laws in 1975 by amending the very statute this Court is now asked to interpret.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.147" offset="12714261">The legislative history described in some detail in the Antitrust Institute's brief shows that actually they were returning the law to the per se rule against resale price maintenance because they thought resale price maintenance was bad and should be prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.639" offset="12788240">But of course, they could always pass a law saying that if their intent is so clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.092" offset="12810079">--That's true, they did not do that here and I'm not suggesting that they did, only that, uniquely among the rules that this Court has established in the antitrust area, this rule has received the repeated attention of Congress; and so the Court's deference to Congress and reluctance to overturn the rule should be at its peek as compared with those other rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.858" offset="12909135">And third, price is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.760" offset="12920733">This Court has said that price competition is the central nervous system of the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.644" offset="12944243">Other restraints, to be sure, might indirectly affect price, but not with the same absolute force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.359" offset="12975172">Territorial restraints don't absolutely prevent price competition because customers can travel or order by phone, mail, or Internet, and indeed under territorial restraints there are often multiple retailers in a particular territory who can compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.331" offset="13039016">Maximum price maintenance doesn't prevent competition at all unless, as the Court noted in Khan, it's really Minimum resale price maintenance in disguise, in which case the Court in Khan said it's illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.008" offset="13085723">Manufacturers can of course pay retailers for the services that enhance the product that are being advanced as the pro-competition benefit of resale price maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.366" offset="13135146">But the question for this Court is whether the manufacturer should be allowed to use a price-fixing agreement to make that payment to buy those services, and that's not a question of fact for a jury to decide in a rule of reason trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.174" offset="13186346">That's a question of statutory interpretation for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.826" offset="13200975">It's a question really of what kind of currency a manufacturer can use to buy those retailer services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.428" offset="13223440">It's also true that the claim that price-fixing works to induce those services is both debatable and untested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.165" offset="13254369">The retailers have no obligations to provide services under the retail price maintenance agreement at issue in this case and in other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3455.982" offset="13977648">But Congress has consistently... well, and the repeal... the reason the repeal of the Miller-Tydings Act seems particularly relevant is that it is indeed... it was an amendment to this statute that this Court is being asked to interpret, so it sheds some light on the on the meaning of this statute as it stands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3487.104" offset="14102095">But when Congress repealed that, there were considerable... there was considerable expression of legislative history, for those who find legislative history helpful, that declared opposition to resale price maintenance, not simply that it was sometimes helpful and sometimes hurtful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.506" offset="14175760">So to the extent Congress's intent can be gleaned from that legislative history, it was an intent to return to the regime of per se illegality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.340" offset="14327061">Thank you, Ms. Underwood.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.972" offset="14345556">The Respondent and its amici seem to recognize that what this Court said in State Oil versus Khan, that a vertical restraint imposed by a single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand competition and, by the way, it enhances intrabrand competition on matters of service and availability and other things in addition to price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.154" offset="14470317">The Respondent and their amici seem to have acknowledged these pro-competitive factors but say you should do it by a contract with 5,000 different retailers, which you then have to go out and enforce, or you have to do it under a Colgate system, which the Ping brief demonstrates it's a blunt instrument, it requires terminating retailers with which you had a relationship for years, it prohibits even talking to the loyal retailers to fix small problems.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="3615.877" offset="14617230">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.137" offset="14618274">What we're suggesting is that the agreement is something, the details can be worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.682" offset="14636456">The manufacturer can... and the Ping brief explains this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.883" offset="14653279">The manufacturer can go to the retailer and say: Look, maybe you didn't get it right, your sales person said the wrong thing; let's fix it, because we want to be dealing together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.688" offset="14688492">The antitrust laws... in other word, what the Respondent and its amici want or they suggest forward integration, so you just acquire all your retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.103" offset="14722137">The benefits of these type of arrangements provide the consumers with choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.728" offset="14744603">It stimulates interbrand competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.589" offset="14756096">It promotes intrabrand competition on things other than price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.612" offset="14772188">It provides consumers with more choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.094" offset="14782114">It ultimately gives more freedom to the manufacturer to stimulate the sale of its products, to enter the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.410" offset="14811372">These are things that the Court has said, and provides a more varied marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.842" offset="14833105">The court has repeatedly said that the presumptive rule is a rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.977" offset="14853585">Per se rules should be crossed out or not adopted unless they're dealing with a practice which is invariably anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.613" offset="14888172">This practice, as acknowledged, is procompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.694" offset="14904472">It provides many opportunities, and it is irrational for vertical restrictions to exist in this world in the non-price area or the maximum price area as subject to the rule of reason and the minimum retail price maintenance under a rigid per se rule that cannot be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.966" offset="14977615">And as this Court has repeatedly held, Congress intended by the use of restraint of trade and the unreasonable restraint of trade for this court to continue to breathe life into the restrictions of the antitrust laws in the benefit of the consumer and in the benefit of competition, eliminating rigid per se rules which make it unlawful for a manufacturer to do something that's rational in the marketplace, to give consumer choices, or to do it in some indirect way that is a lawyer's dream and an entrepreneur's nightmare makes no sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.229" offset="15114601">For all those reasons, the rule of reason in this area, as in the other areas, should replace the per se rule which is rigid and anticompetitive at the end of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.368" offset="15159218">Thank you.</text>
