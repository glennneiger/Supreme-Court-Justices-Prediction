            <text syncTime="27.317" offset="242018">That conclusion that I've stated to the Court was supported by the holding in United States versus Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.839" offset="276082">That case, as the Court well knows, dealt with a situation in which the Government sought to recover money through a tax lien as opposed to a tax levy, which is the situation in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.368" offset="454237">But nonetheless, the holding that I have read in that case very definitively deals with the breadth of section 1346.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.558" offset="494988">And the breadth of section 1346, according to the holding and United States vs. Williams, is certainly broad enough to encompass a third party like Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.449" offset="538560">I do not view the fact that 7426 was not available to be a controlling issue because the question was whether or not 1346 would permit a third party to bring a refund action.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.291" offset="593939">And that was the holding of the court as I read that opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.077" offset="605120">But when Congress provides a special remedy for a particular class of persons, that special remedy usually excludes a more general provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.801" offset="659977">Justice Ginsburg, in the case of 7426, Congress never made that remedy expressly exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.942" offset="700519">The language is completely missing from that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.060" offset="717028">And the argument was raised in United States vs. Williams that if section 1346 was made available to third parties, like Mrs. Williams, it would render meaningless the short statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.987" offset="772722">1346 offers only post deprivation relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.772" offset="791843">section 7426 offers both pre and post deprivation relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.776" offset="811905">So the two statutes can live in harmony and can be harmonized and should not be held to have preempt... one over the other when there is no express declaration from Congress making that the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.702" offset="867598">The Government does cite the principle that when there's a specific statutory scheme that controls over a more general one.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.291" offset="901975">It doesn't cite a tax case for that, at least as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.243" offset="913783">Has that principle ever been applied in the tax code, do you know?</text>

            <text syncTime="201.314" offset="938024">Justice Kennedy, I don't believe that's been applied in the tax code, but I can answer your question, I think, by saying this.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.218" offset="961639">Congress on many instances has made provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.222" offset="993613">Congress knows how to write those provisions into the tax code when it wants to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.876" offset="1012317">In this case, it was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.895" offset="1020362">And I would also like to point out that after the decision in United States vs. Williams, Congress amended 7426 to add a special provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.916" offset="1056411">And in that special provision, it was made exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.885" offset="1072294">And I use that to exemplify the fact that Congress can, when it wants to, make a tax provision exclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.808" offset="1108029">In the law, we don't... we certainly don't want to deprive any statutory provision of its whole purpose and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.664" offset="1139481">And as I understand the purpose of this especially short statute of limitations, it is to enable the Government to dispose of the property that it has seized, and to be able to give clear title to it without somebody coming back, you know, many years later and saying this property should not have been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.827" offset="1224117">How is that purpose served if indeed you can proceed under the provision that has a longer statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="279.747" offset="1251807">Justice Scalia, 7426 has four different components.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.135" offset="1273332">Two of the components are clearly pre-deprivation type remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.270" offset="1289842">They are the ability of a taxpayer or third party to seek an injunction to prohibit the Government from either selling property or conducting a levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.478" offset="1330697">Those are clearly pre-deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.513" offset="1338847">The other two are primarily post deprivation remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.632" offset="1351282">And so the object that the Government was trying to achieve can be achieved through looking at it from a pre-deprivation/post-deprivation analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.820" offset="1392033">I don't believe that the Government's underlying purpose is in any way diminished when the two statutes can live in harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.558" offset="1418991">And without having an exclusivity provision expressly stated in 7426, and given the fact that 1346 on its face plainly waives sovereign immunity for third parties to bring refund suits, the two statutes must be construed--</text>

            <text syncTime="360.985" offset="1576666">And isn't that the basic difference between the two statutes, that one of them deals with a fight about how much money the taxpayer owes, and the other one deals with the method of collection.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.074" offset="1617104">7426 clearly prevents a person from contesting the underlying assessment, whereas in 1346, that is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.597" offset="1655138">But in this case, 1346 is broad enough because it uses the term collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.501" offset="1674782">And just like in Williams, we are not seeking to contest the underlying assessment.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="391.154" offset="1697352">But it does seem to me if you think of the two statutes as performing rather separate functions, one primarily focused at the method of collection, the other the amount of tax, makes quite good sense to have different statute of limitations for the two, because there is an interest in the prompt resolution of the former issue that doesn't apply to the latter.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.568" offset="1775092">Justice Stevens, there is certainly... Government has demonstrated by... or Congress has demonstrated by passing 7426, that there is an interest in a shorter statute of limitations in certain cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.209" offset="1825561">However, I return to my original argument that if 1346 is broad enough to encompass third party refund suits, and if Congress has not made 7426 exclusive, the two statutes should be allowed to coexist.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.337" offset="1894106">This Court has held on other occasions that it will not preempt statutes without a very clear expression from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.741" offset="1923781">And Congress, once again, knew how to do it after the Williams case.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.049" offset="1972996">The Government has the money before you can bring the refund suit.</text>

I think, Your Honor, the Flora requirement, which is a judicially interpretation on the refund statute which requires you, a taxpayer to pay all of its tax liability for a given year before it can bring a refund statute challenge, actually supports our argument here because it shows how complicated it would be to apply that scheme when you're talking about a party who doesn't owe the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.018" offset="7596846">It believes the trust is a nominee or alter ego of the taxpayer and the... the wrongful levy statute has a short statute of limitations for the precise reason that if we seize the property of the trust the Government needs to know promptly if the trust claims it's not the taxpayer's property because the Government, as the Chief Justice indicated, will cease going after the taxpayer if it believes it has already collected the tax from someone else that it believes to be holding the money for the taxpayer, which is different and crucially different than in a refund suit, as Justice Stevens alluded to, because in a refund suit where the taxpayer brings the challenge and has paid the tax, at the end of that suit either the Government has to pay the money back to the taxpayer in a refund or the Government gets to keep the tax and that's the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.665" offset="7791406">In a third party challenge, whether the third party brings it pre-deprivation or post-deprivation, the Government's interest is knowing whether or not the third party has taxpayer property or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.640" offset="7835291">Because if it turns out that it's not the taxpayer's property the Government needs to pursue the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.126" offset="7857234">And Congress accounted for that not only in 7426 by the short statute of limitations, but also for the expression suspension of the Government's period of time that it can pursue the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.768" offset="7903837">The, the section 7426 expressly suspends the time period during the running of a third party challenge whether that's pre or post deprivation.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2434.368" offset="9870230">Thank you, counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.070" offset="9877022">Mr. Ainsa, you have 5 minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis S. Ainsa Jr</label>
            <text syncTime="2441.522" offset="9898860">The Government argues that A.S. Kreider has relevance to this case and I will submit to the Court that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.294" offset="9929998">The analysis in A.S. Kreider about a more specific statute following a general statute controlling was based upon the peculiar syntax of the statute in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.101" offset="9977228">The analysis in A.S. Kreider was that the more general statute was phrased in the negative and that therefore all it did was set an outside time limit that Congress was free to shorten with a subsequent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.278" offset="10033861">We do not have that situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.230" offset="10045668">There was... there is no similar analysis that you can apply to 1346 and 7426.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="2484.134" offset="10069283">And both statutes in Kreider I take it applied to the refund suit?</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis S. Ainsa Jr</label>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="2488.969" offset="10088614">So there were two statutes bearing on the same remedy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="francis_s_ainsa_jr" startTime="2493.657" stopTime="2650.089">
            <label>Mr. Francis S. Ainsa Jr</label>
            <text syncTime="2493.657" offset="10107422">Two statutes bearing on the same remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.109" offset="10117244">And I submit that the A.S. Kreider analysis is not relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.061" offset="10133022">The Government ALSO relies on Brown versus the General Services Administration for the proposition that a very detailed, complete, balanced, structured statute will control over a more general statute, and the argument is of course that 7426 is that type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.926" offset="10220480">But the problem is in the Brown case we were dealing, the Court was dealing, with the Civil Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act was clearly the first piece of legislation that had been enacted by Congress to remedy Federal employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.352" offset="10286204">It was a brand new remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.738" offset="10299683">In the case before the Court today, 7426 was a response to a particular issue that was raised in 1966 and that was that claimants who desired to seek redress from the Government when their property was taken were suing the director.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.051" offset="10380976">They were suing the tax collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.586" offset="10387141">This was just a statute to give them a remedy directly against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.305" offset="10401979">It wasn't creating a brand new situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.323" offset="10414099">It was clarifying that now you could sue the Government directly as opposed to the tax collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.227" offset="10441685">And in fact, the Federal Tax Lien Act prohibited suits against Government officials, as was previously the practice in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.618" offset="10479197">And so it's, this issue of implied repeal with the shorter statute I don't believe is apropos to the situation that confronts us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.390" offset="10522351">And I would like to also simply conclude my argument with regards to the Government's contention that the Government needs to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.044" offset="10556937">In this particular case the tax years in question were 1981 through 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.066" offset="10585045">The Government did not assess the taxpayer until 1993 and 1994, 12 years after the first tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.422" offset="10622452">The government did not levy until 1999, which was 18 years after the first tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.277" offset="10653904">During this time the Government knew, very clearly knew, what the situation was in this case and for whatever reason did not take prompt action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.133" offset="10689326">Therefore, on behalf of the Petitioner, I ask that you reverse and send this case back to the district court for proceedings under the refund statute.</text>
