            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="89866">Today we also decide case No. 05-9222 Burton v. Stuart in a Per Curiam opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.158" offset="126437">We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether our decision in 2004 in Blakely v. Washington announced a new rule and if so, whether it applies retroactively to prisoners seeking Federal Habeas Relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.707" offset="188609">We do not answer these questions however because we conclude that the petition in this case is a second or successive petition under the Federal Habeas Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.979" offset="229778">The petition challenges the same custody imposed by the same judgment as an earlier petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.421" offset="255482">The Federal Habeas Statute requires a prisoner who wishes to file such a second or successive petition in District Court to first authorization from the Federal Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.871" offset="301249">The petitioner here did not seek, much less obtained this authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.708" offset="320684">Accordingly under the Federal Habeas Statute the District Court could not entertain the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.422" offset="343463">We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand with instructions to direct the District Court to dismiss the Habeas Petition for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.417" offset="383482">Our Per Curiam opinion is unanimous.</text>
