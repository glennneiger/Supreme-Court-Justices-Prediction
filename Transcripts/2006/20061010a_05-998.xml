            <text syncTime="8.103" offset="183229">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.039" offset="194932">In Neder versus United States, this Court held that the omission of an offense element from petit jury instructions can be harmless error, even though that omission violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.031" offset="254909">Our submission is that the same analysis applies to the omission of an offense element from a grand jury's indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.237" offset="287719">Such an error violates the Fifth Amendment, but it is harmless when the petit jury, having been properly instructed on all of the elements of the offense, returns a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="48.581" offset="345084">I'm not quite sure if this works, but at the trial before a petit jury there's an opportunity for counsel to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.087" offset="375177">There isn't an opportunity to object when the grand jury indictment comes down.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.872" offset="394298">Now, I guess you could move to quash.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_dreeben" startTime="64.322" stopTime="118.891">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="64.322" offset="408091">That's correct, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.792" offset="413942">In fact, parties do move to dismiss indictments for failure to allege all of the elements of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.512" offset="436826">That happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.479" offset="444662">The motion was erroneously denied by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.750" offset="457828">The trial judge, under Ninth Circuit law, under the assumption that the Ninth Circuit has properly interpreted the law, should have concluded that this indictment failed to allege the substantial step that was part of the attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.741" offset="513730">And if the judge had done that, then the Government would have gotten back to the grand jury and obtained a superseding indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.145" offset="539330">Instead what the judge did was deny the motion, finding that the indictment itself was sufficient, and then instructed the jury on all of the elements that the Ninth Circuit requires as part of this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.368" offset="588231">And so we have now a petit jury verdict beyond a reasonable doubt finding that the attempt did involve a substantial step towards the completion of the offense.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="118.891" offset="626370">Isn't the problem that the motion to quash is going to be made, if counsel is on his toes, is going to be made at the beginning of the trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="128.514" offset="664822">And we want to induce the court to look very carefully at it at that point, because if the court is wrong, somebody has to go through an entire trial as a result of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.007" offset="718844">And the way to induce the court to be very careful at the beginning is to say, this is not harmless error, and you've got to take this very seriously and you can't take any chance on the, in effect, the evidence saving you in harmless error analysis later.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.599" offset="781224">Well, first of all, Justice Souter, motions like this are typically made long in advance of trial, as this one was.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.539" offset="808914">Waiting until the day of trial is far from the optimum practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.693" offset="833573">But that simply reinforces my point.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="173.895" offset="846321">Well, I think what it reinforces is that the judge has enough time to look at it and conscientiously attempt to get the law right without the need for the court to apply the heavy hand of automatic reversal.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="186.285" offset="895954">But you concede that the error would always be harmless if you have a trial before a petit jury, and all of the elements are instructed to be found by the jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="200.212" offset="951647">That doesn't necessarily make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.645" offset="961364">You can imagine a situation where the probable cause and the eventual evidence that supports guilt is adduced after the indictment and the prosecutor says, you know, we're going to find that evidence once we get into it, we don't have it now, but indict anyway without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.607" offset="1029178">In other words, what's your response to the situation where there's no probable cause on an element at the time of the indictment, but that evidence is later adduced and is a sufficient basis to convict?</text>

            <text syncTime="230.481" offset="1072750">My response, Mr. Chief Justice, is the same response that this Court gave in United States versus Mechanik, where it was confronted with an analogous problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.551" offset="1105038">And that was in that case, a violation of the rule that allowed two witnesses to testify at the same time before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.091" offset="1139101">And the Court was specifically confronted with the question: Was this harmless error because the petit jury has now found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?</text>
            <text syncTime="255.597" offset="1173165">And it answered that question yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.714" offset="1181629">And en route to that answer, it said, we could logically be persuaded that what we're supposed to do is compare the evidence in front of the grand jury to the error and see whether the error was prejudicially consequential for the grand jury's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.891" offset="1242337">But we're not going to do that, the Court explicitly said in Mechanik, because once there is a finding of beyond a reasonable doubt, the question of probable cause is shown a fortiori and--</text>

            <text syncTime="284.966" offset="1290612">Excuse me, you mean you can never decide this question until after the trial is completed and you see whether the jury convicts beyond a reasonable doubt?</text>

            <text syncTime="303.411" offset="1364381">And this Court has recognized that trial judges don't need incentives of an automatic reversal rule to get them to comply with the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.828" offset="1466050">But it was an extension of its prior precedents in a way that wasn't directly foreseeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.799" offset="1489978">The United States Attorney's office had every reason to believe, based on language in prior Ninth Circuit cases, that alleging an attempt to enter was adequate to allege the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.340" offset="1544104">I wonder whether we can answer the generic question that you presented, whether the omission of an element of a criminal offense from the indictment can constitute harmless error, without considering the nature of the alleged defect here.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.382" offset="1600319">I don't know how you can answer... if you look at whether the alleged defect here is susceptible to harmless error analysis, or whether if we were to agree with you, in fact, it is harmless, how you can answer those questions without reaching a conclusion about whether there was any defect in the indictment in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="893.436" offset="3724493">I mean, we're talking about a Federal system here in which 70 to 80,000 cases are indicted a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="914.383" offset="3808293">I think that this is a good example of that, where the Ninth Circuit extended its prior precedents to find that an indictment that didn't allege the overt act was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.222" offset="3847686">And then the Government is stuck, and the rule of automatic reversal, which the Court may appear to think in this case is particularly disproportionate since the indictment looks fine, functions identically even if there's a conceded violation that every member of the Court would say yes, there's a missing element here.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.285" offset="3919888">The fundamental problem is that the grand jury sits to decide probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1031.093" offset="4275154">And if in fact they get to trial and they don't prove the element, then it can either be thrown out because an element has not been proven or he can go back and revive the motion to quash.</text>

            <text syncTime="3230.180" offset="13071523">I wouldn't necessarily describe it as lesser included, but Rule 31 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure does allow a trial judge to submit an attempt offense to the petit jury when attempt is a violation of the substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.656" offset="13129410">I should say that the Government's position is that there does not need to be a separate charge of attempt in the indictment in order to permit Rule 31 to operate, but there is a circuit split over whether lesser included offenses can be submitted to the jury unless they are included in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.920" offset="13210494">So we're not operating under a uniform rule that would always allow us to do that, and I'm not sure which way the Ninth Circuit goes on that, although I could hazard a guess.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.083" offset="13495124">And the reason that they do is because the entire criminal justice system, victims, witnesses, the judge, the prosecutors, the defense bar, jurors, everybody is being asked to go through a trial that was conducted on an error-free basis by hypothesis, simply because there was a mistake at the charging phase.</text>
