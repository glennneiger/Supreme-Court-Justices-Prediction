            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90380">I have the opinion in case number 05-7058, Jones v. Bock and the consolidating case is 05-7142 Williams v. Overton and 05-9222 Walton v. Bouchard.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.518" offset="156418">These cases were brought by three prisoners confined in the Michigan state prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.061" offset="178569">Each file a grievance complaining about some aspects of prison conditions or their treatment in prison and after these grievances were denied, prisoners filed suit under the federal civil right statute, Title 42 Section 1983, raising the same claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.098" offset="246697">There is nothing unusual about that last year nearly 10% of all suits filed in federal court were suits by prisoners complaining about prison condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.140" offset="286925">In 1995, Congress passed a law to try to reduce the numbers of such prison suits called the Prison Litigation Reform Act or the PLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.515" offset="328408">There were two key components to that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.207" offset="339170">First, before prisoners could file suit, they have to exhaust available prison grievance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.903" offset="365920">Second, federal district judges were given authority to screen prisoner suits even before an answer was filed by state authorities and dismiss those that were frivolous, malicious or failed to stay the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.793" offset="421508">In the cases before us, the Sixth Circuit applied three procedural rules that it and some other federal Courts of Appeal have adopted to carry out the purposes of the PLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.312" offset="471559">These rules require a prisoner to demonstrate in his complaint that he has exhausted available grievance procedures permit suit only against the defendants who were named by the prisoner in his grievance and require courts to dismiss the prisoner’s law suit, if he fails to satisfy the exhausting requirement as to any single claim in his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.950" offset="566122">The Sixth Circuit dismissed the prisoners law suit in the case is before us for failing to comply with these rules, other circuits have declined to apply such rules and we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.599" offset="624741">First, the Sixth Circuit Rule that prisoners must plead and show exhaustion in their complaints, now the usual rule is that exhaustion is an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.322" offset="667582">Defendants have the obligation to raise failure to exhaust if they seek to argue that and plaintiffs don’t have to show exhaustion when they file a complaint to start a law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.152" offset="714916">The Sixth Circuit reasoned that because the PLRA requires exhaustion and provides for judicial screening prior to a defendant’s answer the act would be more effective in reducing prisoner’s suits if prisoners were required to show exhaustion in their complaints prior to the screening.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.909" offset="789939">Maybe so but the PLRA is silent on whether exhaustion should be pleaded in the complaint or raised as a defense, and therefore we think court should follow the usual procedural rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.374" offset="839781">As noted that rule is that exhaustion is an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.520" offset="860365">The Sixth Circuit should not have deviated from the usual practice due to perceive policy concerns when there was no basis for doing so in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.320" offset="899653">The Sixth Circuit also imposed the rule requiring the prisoners name in the one step of the prison grievance process, any individual later named as a defendant in the federal law suit, otherwise the suit would be thrown out on the ground that the prisoner did not satisfy the exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.011" offset="970393">Here again there is no basis in the PLRA for this requirement that Act simply requires prisoners to exhaust “such administrative remedies as are available” and the prisons grievance policy in place of the time petitioners filed their grievances in this case and these cases makes no mention of identifying particular individual in the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.779" offset="1065479">It is the prison grievance requirement that must be exhausted and the Sixth Circuit was wrong to impose an additional requirement not spelled out in the Prison Litigation Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.303" offset="1115529">The final procedural rule imposed by the Sixth Circuit requires courts to dismiss an entire complaint if any one claim in the complaint is unexhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.700" offset="1153146">Now here the Sixth Circuit can point to language in the PLRA, the act provides that “no action shall be brought” if administrative remedies have not been exhausted but this language referring to an action rather than a particular claim is boilerplate.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.906" offset="1225975">Courts do not typically dismiss entire complaints if a single discrete claim is flout for example if one claim is barred by the statute of limitations and another is not, only the bad claim will be dismissed even though such statute typically say “no action shall be brought” just like statute edition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.727" offset="1305283">We see no reason for a different result under the PLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.555" offset="1324509">We fully appreciate the challenges faced by federal court around the country and trying to deal with the flood of prisoner complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.268" offset="1355438">The job of the Judge however remains that of construing the statue not making it better by yielding to the temptations of policy making.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.877" offset="1389815">The new rules adopted by the court below cannot be found in the Prison Litigation Reform Act and should not have been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.219" offset="1419177">We reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.524" offset="1440388">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
