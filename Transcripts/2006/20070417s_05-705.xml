            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="6.027" offset="113935">The first is called Global Crossing v. Metrophones, and it begins with telephone deregulation which allowed callers a choice of what long distance carrier they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.694" offset="156671">But sometimes they go a pay-phone, and the pay-phone company would connect them not with the long distance carrier that the caller wanted but with the company that the pay-phone operator wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.213" offset="202751">Well Congress thought that was a bad idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.646" offset="212469">So, they passed a law and they said that the pay-phone company has to connect to however the caller wants connected to, whatever carrier, and moreover has to be for free, you don’t have to put $0.25 in the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.212" offset="266699">At that point the pay-phone company said, well who is going to pay us for the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.377" offset="283313">So Congress passes another law and says let the FCC work that out, and the FCC tried to work it out over a couple of years, and finally what they said was, well here is who pays, the caller connects to a particular carrier through the pay-phone, then the carrier pays, $0.24 a call, or whatever they agree upon and the carrier can charge the ultimate customer with his long distance bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.013" offset="393863">Now apparently after that some carriers still wouldn’t turnover the $0.24 to the pay-phone operator, atleast that’s what the pay-phone operator will say.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.736" offset="432838">So, the pay-phone operators, some of them, or one of them anyway went to the FCC, and the FCC issued an order saying that you have to pay, and if you don’t it is unreasonable practice under Section 201(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="102.333" offset="499189">Later the pay-phone operators said they are still not paying us, so they brought a suit in Federal Court, under a different Section 207 which seems linked to §201(b) and the only question before us is whether they can bring that suit in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.077" offset="582153">Well ultimately what we say it is ultimately because it takes a while to explain this case, ultimately what we say is, well §207 if you read the words is linked to violations of §201(b), and what we have here is a regulation under §201(b) which says, when you don’t pay for that call, you don’t pay the pay-phone operator, you have committed an unreasonable practice that seems to us like a violation of §201(b), it says you can bring the suit for a violation of §201(b) its reasonable for them to say that, bring the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.286" offset="726976">Now, that’s the opinion of the court, we affirm the Ninth Circuit similar determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.909" offset="749442">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion, and Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
