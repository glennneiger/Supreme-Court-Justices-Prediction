            <text syncTime="26.900" offset="262621">The Ninth Circuit's rejection of a reasoned State court factual determination and decision is improper under any deferential standard of review, and it is particularly improper under the highly deferential standard of review required under the AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.677" offset="325733">This morning I'd like to try to develop three... three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.629" offset="341615">First, the State court's factual finding that Landrigan instructed his attorney not to present any mitigating evidence was not an unreasonable finding and, in fact, is the most logical interpretation of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.705" offset="393860">Although Landrigan now argues that the record does not show whether his decision not to present mitigation evidence was knowing or voluntary, that is not a claim that was ever developed in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.810" offset="434298">He never alleged in his State post-conviction proceedings that that, his decision to do that was not knowing or voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.750" offset="462092">Secondly, an evidentiary hearing is unwarranted in this case--</text>

            <text syncTime="81.752" offset="482050">Does the Constitution require there be no involuntary?</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="89.474" offset="512979">So if the record showed that he didn't get, there wasn't a procedure followed to voluntarily waive those Constitutional rights, wouldn't the district court be able to reexamine that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent E. Cattani</label>
            <text syncTime="98.364" offset="548505">Well, there's no colloquy requirement for a defendant to waive presentation of mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.900" offset="570657">And I think it would have been enough if the defendant or defense counsel had simply said my... if the attorney had said my client has instructed me not to present any mitigating evidence, and that would be adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.708" offset="621857">If a defendant chooses to make a claim that his waiver was not knowing or voluntary, the burden would shift to him to do that in a post-conviction proceeding, and he did not do that in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="129.598" offset="673475">How would he make such a claim in this case where in open court he was asked by the judge, right, with nobody twisting his arm, whether it was the case that he did not want any mitigating evidence introduced?</text>
            <text syncTime="143.525" offset="729168">And he said, right, yes, that's correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="147.177" offset="743797">It would be very difficult for him to make that argument and I suspect that's why the argument was not raised in the State post-conviction proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.570" offset="797295">You were outlining three different points.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.439" offset="804819">But it seems to me that from the very start, what happens is that you and your brother for the respondent are talking past each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.097" offset="855392">You want to talk to us about the adequacy of the State court's finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.918" offset="878693">The respondent says what we... all we want is a hearing in the district court, and those are two different issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.923" offset="918712">We want a hearing in the district court, i.e., so that we can show the findings are insubstantial or incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.529" offset="953194">Those, it seems to me, are two different issues, and I sense the briefs are talking past each other on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.933" offset="974823">Did you see the same thing?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent E. Cattani</label>
            <text syncTime="206.635" offset="981615">Yes, I did, Your Honor, and I think the reason for that is, in our view an evidentiary hearing is not necessary because the factual finding by the State court obviates the need for one.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.693" offset="1029785">An evidentiary hearing would be developing evidence that would never have been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.395" offset="1048593">Given this factual finding, the State court is in effect saying no matter what counsel might or might not have developed, it would not have been presented at sentencing because this defendant specifically instructed his attorney not to present any mitigating evidence.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="237.154" offset="1103659">In your view, what is the standard for when the district court may hold an evidentiary hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="242.308" offset="1124244">I know there's an element of discretion in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.991" offset="1135006">A district... the district court can order an evidentiary hearing if the defendant has been denied an opportunity to develop relevant facts necessary to resolve a colorable claim in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.449" offset="1180877">And I think here the defendant fails on two different points.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.125" offset="1235525">Certainly it's the petitioner's obligation, a defendant's obligation to present these claims in State court and the only... the reason--</text>

            <text syncTime="281.266" offset="1280143">But if he has done that, when can he ask for a further hearing?</text>

            <text syncTime="287.420" offset="1304698">He has not done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.687" offset="1309818">He did not attempt to develop facts or he was not precluded from developing facts that would be relevant to a resolution of his ineffective assistance claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.793" offset="1342210">If I could, Your Honor, there are two different parts of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.495" offset="1357047">First, the facts are not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.447" offset="1364884">The facts that he's seeking to develop in an evidentiary hearing is this additional, this mitigation that should have been developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.100" offset="1395499">If, in fact, his avowal that he did not want any mitigation to be presented is accurate, then these other facts are not relevant.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="320.141" offset="1435623">No, but isn't that the problem in your argument?</text>
            <text syncTime="323.593" offset="1449416">Because your argument assumes, and I think you said this quite candidly a moment ago, that once there has been a finding that he informed the court that he did not want mitigation evidence presented, that in effect is a matter of... binds him as a matter of law for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.472" offset="1524962">And what he is saying here is look, if I had known that there was this kind of mitigating evidence, as opposed to what was proffered to the court at the end of the trial in fact, I would not have made that waiver, if you want to call it that.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.885" offset="1606569">I would not have made that representation to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.587" offset="1617436">And what I want is an evidentiary hearing to show that, to show that in fact, when I said to the court no mitigating evidence, I didn't mean this.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.263" offset="1672084">And he wants a hearing for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.882" offset="1682533">The only way it seems to me that you can properly win on the issue that he thus raises is exactly the way that I think you said a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.254" offset="1724015">That once there is a finding that he made a statement, whatever its predicate, a statement that I don't want any mitigating evidence presented, that is the end of the issue as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.654" offset="7541694">I'd like to begin by clearing up what exactly we did and didn't argue with respect to waiver and what exactly is and isn't before this Court on that set of issues in our judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.748" offset="7594043">I then would like to spend a couple of minutes on what I think the Ninth Circuit did and what effect that would have on this Court's disposition of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1871.287" offset="7640228">I'd like to turn to the question of whether we have asserted colorable claims that warrant an evidentiary hearing here, which is all that we're asking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.826" offset="7678366">Now, with respect to this question of whether we pursued or didn't pursue waiver, I'm afraid counsel for the State is just wrong about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.230" offset="7707937">It's important to understand how this comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.996" offset="7715042">We asserted a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, deficient performance and prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.281" offset="7736149">The State asserted as a defense to that claim: No, no, he's waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.185" offset="7755793">And the trial judge, the State habeas judge in the State court conviction ruling, agreed with that and said, well, yes, he's waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.974" offset="7794977">We then filed a petition for rehearing in which we said, no, you can't rely on that defense because it's got to be a knowing and intelligent waiver under Johnson against Zerbst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.396" offset="7828623">That's at page 92 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.865" offset="7838549">That motion for rehearing was denied without any further comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.752" offset="7858089">We then took a petition to review to the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.704" offset="7869896">That's also in the joint appendix and I believe the page cite is 101 and 102, in which we specifically argued that you can't look to this so-called waiver as a defense to our claim of ineffective assistance because it wasn't knowingly and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.564" offset="7933321">Now, in the State's response to our petition, which unfortunately is not in the joint appendix but is in the record, the State says: No, this waiver is binding and, furthermore, you're procedurally defaulted because this procedure was decided on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.688" offset="7985775">But the one thing the State does not say is that you raised this Johnson against Zerbst issue too late, it can't be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2237.888" offset="9106637">There's an assumption in the State's argument that Landrigan's conduct at the sentencing hearing itself was a waiver and considered to be a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.095" offset="9147388">But if one looks at the transcript of that hearing, and this is D to the appendix to the petition and beginning at page D-4... D-3 is where the colloquy occurs where this alleged waiver happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.689" offset="9213844">The very next thing that occurs, the very next thing that occurs, is the trial judge says: Okay, I want to hear from the mitigation witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.080" offset="9251356">Then the mitigation witnesses say: Well, we're not going to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.199" offset="9267865">Then the very next thing that occurs is the trial judge says: Well, I want a proffer of what they would have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.554" offset="9297227">Then when... then when all that's said and done, the trial judge says to the lawyer... and this is at D-15... you got anything else, and the lawyer says, no, Your Honor, that's all I've got, all I've got is what's in the sentencing memo and these two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.628" offset="9353547">Then the judge proceeds to pass sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.814" offset="9366294">That's the... the particularly important pages are D-20 and 21, and on those pages you will see that what the judge does is not treat Mr. Landrigan's statements as a waiver, because if she had treated those statements as a waiver what she would have said is, well, here's the aggravation case, Mr. Landrigan has waived mitigation, he has a right to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.864" offset="14358503">He has continued to want to proceed with the appeals, signing the IFP papers, et cetera, and it turns out there were neurological problems that were afflicting him, very serious, at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.470" offset="14400926">So that's what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.588" offset="14409390">If I could say in conclusion, just remind the Court what it said in the first Norrell decision, that even in the world of habeas there's a difference between deference and abdication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.562" offset="14457246">And in a situation like this one, in which the State court has not afforded an evidentiary hearing and has not allowed the development of the evidence that bears directly on Mr. Landrigan's claims, it would be a form of abdication to hold that he can be conclusively barred from proceeding further, even to an evidentiary hearing, on the basis of the present record.</text>
