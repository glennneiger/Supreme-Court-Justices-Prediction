            <text syncTime="7.817" offset="178929">Mr. Farr.</text>

          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="9.236" stopTime="190.956">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="9.236" offset="184572">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.240" offset="200559">In the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress made one thing very clear, that it wanted the Department of Labor to define the boundaries and fill in the details of the companionship services exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.640" offset="266178">And I think that has two important implications for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.513" offset="281643">First of all, when the Department has filled in the details, after notice and comment rulemaking, its regulations should receive Chevron deference as long as they are permissible implementation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.763" offset="338694">Second, and particularly specific to this case, if there are ambiguities in the regulations, or as we have here, an apparent facial inconsistency, the court should accept the Secretary's resolution of that ambiguity provided that it is a reasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.766" offset="414658">And here we submit it's not only a reasonable one, it is by far the most sensible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.929" offset="435347">Now I'd actually like to turn, if I may, to the second issue first, because I think that's the source of a lot of the concern in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.464" offset="469516">Plainly the two regulations, section 10... 552.109(a), which is the regulation directly at issue before this Court, and 552.3, which is the regulation relied on heavily by the Second Circuit to strike down the present regulation, have some inconsistency between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.139" offset="564183">But it is also plain that the Department could not have intended to say at one and the same time that the only employers entitled use the exemption were homeowners and then say in another section promulgated at the same time that also third-party employers are entitled to the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.754" offset="650701">So the question is, how does one resolve this apparent inconsistency?</text>
            <text syncTime="130.667" offset="670345">And the Secretary says, well, the only regulation that we promulgated that, in fact, deals specifically with the issue of third-party employment is 552.109(a), which is in fact headed Third-Party Employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.887" offset="739204">And that section 552.3, while containing some language that might be read to address that issue, in fact deals with several other topics.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.465" offset="777447">Specifically it deals with the topic of what kinds of jobs are involved in domestic service, maids, chauffeurs, footmen, et cetera; where those have to be performed, in a private home; and in fact, somewhat more than that, in the private home of the person receiving the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.887" offset="859158">So it's not enough, for example, for somebody to conduct a service like laundry or baby sitting in his or her own house, it has to be in the house of the person receiving the services.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="190.956" offset="911507">I thought the words were home of the person who employs, not who receives the services but who employs.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.083" offset="944004">Oh, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.052" offset="947870">The literal language is not specifically what I was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.906" offset="963230">What I'm talking about is the Secretary's attempt to resolve what is an apparent inconsistency between the literal language in 552.3 and the literal language of section 552.109(a).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="217.623" stopTime="222.528">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="217.623" offset="1018087">By... reading out the words "of the person who employs" her?</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="222.528" offset="1037731">Well, essentially reading them to say they, they were not intended to address directly the subject of third party employment which is the subject addressed in 109(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="235.476" offset="1089558">And I think if one is... even leaving aside the question of deference to the Secretary for a moment, Justice Ginsburg, if one is simply talking about making a fair resolution of these conflicting provisions from the ground up, it seems to me the first thing that one would do is apply the canon that the specific provision controls the general.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.458" offset="1173463">And if one looks at the two provisions, section 109(a) is a provision that deals with one thing and one thing only: that is third party employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.526" offset="1213692">And it says explicitly and straight out that persons who are employed by third-party employers are... or third-party employers who employ persons performing domestic services are entitled to the exemption.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="279.554" offset="1265832">I thought it also addressed, unlike the more general regulation, just people who have companionship services.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.662" offset="1306270">So if you have a maid or a cook or a footman, who doesn't provide companionship, then 109 is inapplicable.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="302.090" offset="1356007">What's a footman?</text>
            <text syncTime="302.691" offset="1358410">I don't even know what a footman is.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.431" offset="1365411">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="304.771" offset="1366769">What is a footman?</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="306.141" offset="1372203">--I think that may be beyond my expertise, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.377" offset="1393101">The... of course that doesn't address anything beyond companionship services, of course, because there is not an exemption beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.841" offset="1431031">And that's one of the interesting things about 552.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.334" offset="1444928">In addition to generally dealing with this question of what kind of jobs are domestic service, it is, in fact, going well beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion of the exemption for companionship services, because jobs like chauffeurs, and maids, and all of that are not subject to the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.877" offset="1523191">So it really looking at what 552.3 is doing despite the couple of words that... at the beginning of it, is giving a general definition of what constitutes domestic employment, what constitutes domestic services for purposes not only of the exemption but, in fact, really for the purposes of coverage as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.603" offset="1610022">And the Department has taken that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.153" offset="1616291">It says this is, in fact, the only definition of domestic service that we have in the regulations, and it is not just intended to be limited to the particular situation of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.871" offset="1663103">It applies more broadly than that to coverage as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.503" offset="1673656">So I think in all those senses, Justice Kennedy, 109 is a very specific provision, 552.3 deals with a number of other subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.070" offset="1715870">Now, one other thing on the statutory interpretation part is that the reading of 552.3 that Respondent offers also leads to the problem that essentially sets up a tension with another one of the regulations which is 552.101(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="410.530" offset="1789744">552.101(a) which I'm sorry... I don't have the right page number here... it is on page 77a of the appendix to the petition... has, carries over the language from 552.3 about in the home of the employer that Justice Ginsburg referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.556" offset="1877829">But then it also says that this includes people who are commonly referred to as private household workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.201" offset="1912415">And the one thing we know from the Department of Labor submissions to Congress in 1974 and also from what the Department has said before this Court is that that term at the time was defined by the Department and known by Congress to constitute more than just employees employed by the homeowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.016" offset="1995694">There was a special second category for people who worked in the home of the homeowner at the homeowner's request but were employed by a third party agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.471" offset="2037489">Now somewhere underlying all of this question, I think, is statutory interpretation and indeed all of Respondent's arguments against deference to the Department is a basic underlying premise, which is that Congress really would not have wanted, even if it didn't say so, for the exemption to apply to employees who work for third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.455" offset="2129440">And I would just like to suggest that there really is no basis for thinking that Congress would have wanted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.090" offset="2155981">First of all, third party employers such as private agencies provide services for the particular group of people which Congress was trying to assist with this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.038" offset="2203837">People who by reason of age or disability are unable to care for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.730" offset="2222541">Agencies acting as the employers specifically can do the hiring, they can do the vetting and the screening, the background screening for employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.928" offset="2263396">They can provide necessary paperwork, filing Social Security documents and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.231" offset="2284608">So, in fact, for Congress to have some sort of bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit unusual.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.578" offset="2681983">The report uses the term private households workers frequently interchangeably with the term domestic employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.628" offset="2730152">Now, the Department of Labor when it was reporting to Congress, as Congress has required it to do, the Department of Labor used the term private households workers, specifically defined in there by the Department, to say this means not just employees employed by the homeowner but also people who are employed by third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.102" offset="2820014">So I think it is a fair assumption that when the Senate report was using that phrase, it was using it in the same manner that the Department of Labor reports have.</text>

            <text syncTime="943.857" offset="3923112">So what Congress would have been addressing here, if it had been squarely facing the issue, would have not just been the question of how to treat large and small corporations, but whether it wanted to deny the exemption to covered enterprises such as state and local agencies who, in fact, do provide a lot of the direct employees who provide companionship care.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.101" offset="4020079">They have a lot of employees who actually go into homes and care for people who are employed by state and local governments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.909" offset="5387223">The exemption here expresses no limitation based on the identity of the employer and we think it was well within the agency's discretion to conclude that what Congress had in mind here was a categorical exemption based on the type of services that are being provided; and while that may mean that there are certain workers who are now exempt who were not previously exempt, that's because Congress for the first time in 1974 focused on this problem of companionship services being provided to those who cannot care for themselves; and we think that follows from the text, and for the reasons Congress adopted that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.193" offset="6312376">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.857" offset="6323034">On October 1, 1974, just five months after the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act took effect, the Department of Labor exercised its delegated law-making function to define this term "domestic service employment", which exists in the companionship exemption and nowhere else in the amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.411" offset="6413313">And they defined its clearly and explicitly to apply only to companions and baby sitters employed by the household.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.067" offset="6447899">At the same time, DOL provided a persuasive explanation for that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.231" offset="6472559">The Department found that such companions and baby sitters when employed by covered enterprises had been covered prior to the amendments and that it could not have been Congress' purpose, when amendments were explicitly designed to extend coverage, to at the same time contract coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.091" offset="6548000">The very preamble to the Act states that the purposes of the amendments are to expand the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.056" offset="6575899">Therefore, the DOL itself concluded in October of 1974 that it was not the purpose of those amendments to deny the Act's protection to previously covered domestic service employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.976" offset="6627517">The definition in 552.3, which expressly applies only to the exemption, conflicts directly with the final third-party regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.634" offset="8246169">They adopted it in 1961, expanded it in 1966, and indeed expanded these very amendments in 1974.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.371" offset="8537068">Number one, contrary to what has been suggested, the language in the exemption is not identical to the language in the extension provision extending the minimum wage and overtime requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.050" offset="8587850">There is an important difference, and that difference is the word employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.283" offset="8604778">Now that's important for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.895" offset="8615227">Number one, of course, coverage provisions are to be read broadly and exemptions narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.569" offset="8637901">So there's an additional word that can and would suggest it should be read as a term of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.982" offset="8659530">Number two, that difference must be given significance, if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.985" offset="8675622">The word should not be read to mean the same as the coverage provisions when it doesn't exist in the coverage provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.760" offset="8702685">And number three, we should avoid redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.702" offset="8714492">There is a reading of that unique language, "domestic service employment", which makes sense and in fact, is exactly the reading given by the Department.</text>

Mr. Becker, if there is room for the Agency to read this statute either way, one way that the third party employee would come under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they would not, would be treated the same way as the person employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to end up being the householder paying for it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.821" offset="13266903">So why isn't the most reasonable interpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption that the exemption would apply across the board, so that all workers in this category would be exempt?</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.990" offset="13319566">Your Honor, setting aside, of course, all the reasons about Congress's intent in 552.3 which we've already explained, we would not say that that there is any credible evidence in the legislative history or the text of the Act to suggest that cost was a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.631" offset="13394172">And let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.963" offset="13399501">The Department for the first time when it promulgated its advisory memorandum suggested this was the basis of the third party regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.417" offset="13429280">It said nothing of the sort in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.780" offset="13442760">As support for the assertion it cited four isolated comments in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.715" offset="13462508">None of them except the last... and there is only one of them related in any way to the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.209" offset="13492497">The one that related to the exemption in fact directly supports our position, because it describes those people who are not within the exemption as the professional domestics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.869" offset="13539099">So we don't think that there's any basis for suggesting that cost was the underlying rationale; and, in fact, it is really implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.823" offset="13566894">Because at the same time, for example, Congress extended the provisions of the Act which covered nursing homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.167" offset="13596255">At the same time, as has been pointed out, Congress only exempted casual babysitters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.482" offset="13621542">Now We would submit that if Congress was concerned about cost, in creating this babysitter and companionship exemption, the primary intended beneficiaries of that would have been working families where both people worked and therefore who require a full-time baby sitter--</text>

            <text syncTime="3393.398" offset="13721225">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.511" offset="13729689">Respondent in response to Justice Scalia's question about how Respondent would reconcile the regulation 552.3 and 109(a) actually did not I believe attempt any reconciliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.903" offset="13799279">If I understand respondent's position correctly, it's simply 109(a) has to be invalidated dated and 552.3 stands in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.439" offset="13837418">I think that's incorrect for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.240" offset="13852569">First of all, the basis for it is essentially this apparent distinction between the define and delimit authority and the more general authority to enact necessary rules and regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.739" offset="13902619">But, in fact, as Justice Breyer pointed out in his question, both grants of authority were invoked by the Department when it enacted both regulations simultaneously, not limited to either subpart A or subpart B, and for the reasons that Justice Alito points out, it is a very odd thing to attribute to the Department to say that it would exercise two different legislative powers in different parts of the... of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.396" offset="14017245">There's no reason it would do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.788" offset="14022783">The subpart B regulations clearly are regulations that delimit the terms of the exemption in 213(a)(15).</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.372" offset="14053085">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.904" offset="14059249">So why in fact if it was doing what Congress authorized it to do under 213(a)(15), would it instead of relying on the grant of authority in that provision, rely on some other general grant of authority?</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.712" offset="14114525">It makes no logical sense to attribute that to the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.326" offset="14132915">And it seems to me, in... excuse me... in fact, that that argument points up one of the difficulties here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.881" offset="14159142">It seems to me that the arguments here are a way of simply trying to push the Department aside so that the courts can ultimately do the final job of exposition on this exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.998" offset="14203654">Not only contrary to the basic principle of Chevron, which is where that where is ambiguity in the statute, or room for interpretation, the agencies are given the opportunity to do that within reasonable bounds; it is also contrary to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.217" offset="14268543">It is clear as I said at the beginning of my argument, the Department was the agency chosen by Congress to do the work of defining and delimiting the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.735" offset="14314623">Now I'd like to say just one other thing in response to Justice Stevens' question about the particular nature of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.752" offset="14346596">This is a suit for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.444" offset="14357463">It is a suit claiming willful damages.</text>
