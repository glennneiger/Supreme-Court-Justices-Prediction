            <text syncTime="982.898" offset="4083260">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="985.084" offset="4092037">It might help if I could start by putting this case into its context in both the United States and international patent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.988" offset="4115652">Section 271(f) is a limited extension of normal territoriality principles that is designed to shore up the prohibition against actually making a patented invention in the United States, but it does not take the further and extraordinary step of applying United States law to the conduct of copying parts abroad for assembly and sale abroad conduct is properly the subject of foreign law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.067" offset="4195900">As a result, in the context of traditional manufacturing, for example, it has always been understood pursuant to the statute's text, that while companies cannot make parts in the United States for final assembly abroad... that's too close to making it here... they may make copies in a foreign country by, for example, sending the design to the foreign country or sending a specific part to the foreign country that can be copied there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.931" offset="4283358">That distinction between copying in the United States and copying in the foreign country has two critical dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.251" offset="4308645">The first is that it protects the foreign government's sovereign prerogative to establish the rules of competition that will govern companies that wish to compete in that foreign country's markets by copying their products abroad, assembling them there and selling them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.159" offset="4364338">The second, which is the flip side of that point, is that it enables United States companies to compete on an even playing field abroad against their foreign competitors by manufacturing, assembling, and selling parts abroad, subject--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="1064.131" offset="4408223">Mr. Joseffer, to the, to the extent that you are claiming that there are foreign nations that would have an interest in this, usually when that is so, hear from them and in this case there is a strange silence in that regard.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daryl Joseffer</label>
            <text syncTime="1079.124" offset="4468200">--I think that... I can say... a couple points I can make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.890" offset="4479276">One is, this case has, has been viewed because of the Federal Circuit's attempt to tie this to software on the grounds that software can easily be copied abroad, I think this case has been somewhat narrowly viewed as a software case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.765" offset="4522744">But in truth, there's no basis for distinguishing software from anything else, and if the Federal Circuit's decision was actually taken to its logical conclusion I have no doubt that other nations would be quite concerned, like in... in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.239" offset="4568615">One is we have looked, not exhaustively but we have looked, and we have not been able to find a single other country that would apply its law in the circumstances if they were reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.428" offset="4605396">In other words if a German condition wanted to compete in the United States subject to German law by making copies here, assembling them here, selling them here, Germany would stay out of that because it's the United States' prerogative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.153" offset="4652311">Also there are significant differences between the nations' patent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.705" offset="4666522">For software in particular, the United States is much more bullish on the patentability of software-related inventions than many other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.544" offset="4697869">But even for more mundane reasons, if we were talking about anything... it could be that the foreign government doesn't think that an invention is particularly novel, it just disagrees with us about that, or it doesn't think there is sufficient advance in the prior art sufficiently inventive to warrant patent protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.303" offset="4756906">And if the foreign country is going to make that determination regarding competition policy in its own borders, it's entitled to make that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.287" offset="13496850">And our... we have given dozens of references to the use of intangible software, program software as components.</text>
