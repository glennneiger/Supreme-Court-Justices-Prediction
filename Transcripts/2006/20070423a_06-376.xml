            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Redding</label>
            <text syncTime="7.963" offset="180102">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.537" offset="190446">The Federal Circuit's opinion is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.662" offset="198910">Enactment of Section 6404(h) did not repeal district court and Court of Federal Claims refund jurisdiction over interest by the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.814" offset="235586">Both circuits have found that there was pre-existing jurisdiction prior to the enactment of Section 6406(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="29.687" offset="267037">Nothing in Section 6404(h) expressly repeals that jurisdiction, and there are many instances in the code where Congress when it does intend to expressly limit jurisdiction, will state that in the enabling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.759" offset="327328">Reference to the tax court, specific reference to the tax court in 6404(h) was mandated unnecessary by Section 7442 and the nature of the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.598" offset="374662">The tax court is only given jurisdiction over those matters where it is specifically set out in the tax code.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.751" offset="399321">And the established framework of pay and sue jurisdiction in the district courts and prepayment jurisdiction in the tax court is a well established framework for tax litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.169" offset="444984">That has been accepted and enunciated by this Court as far back as the Flora opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.823" offset="467553">It's a well established pattern of duality of jurisdiction in the two forums.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="84.413" offset="485944">But not with respect to abatement of interest in particular.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_e_redding" startTime="89.506" stopTime="136.285">
            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Redding</label>
            <text syncTime="89.506" offset="506319">Not with respect to abatement of interest, Your Honor, but as a general basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.972" offset="532128">The availability of a prepayment forum that was originally enacted to be complementary to the ability to pay and sue in order to protect smaller taxpayers, and avoid the hardships faced by having to pay in full before having access to refund jurisdiction, and in fact perhaps to avoid bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.232" offset="605166">That is completely consistent with the way this section is enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.198" offset="629095">Section 6404(h) even includes the limitation that only taxpayers with a net worth below $2 million or corporations below $7 million have prepayment access to the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.428" offset="677996">And abatement by itself is generally a prepayment remedy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="136.285" stopTime="179.783">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="136.285" offset="693460">That's a... on that point, Mr. Redding, it seems odd that given this tripartite system, Congress would want only the tax court to be restricted in the people who could claim the abatement, the net worth test applicable in the tax court on your theory, if there is authority in the claims court and in the district courts, they're not limited to the net worth restrictions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_e_redding" startTime="179.783" stopTime="219.672">
            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Redding</label>
            <text syncTime="179.783" offset="867436">That is correct, Your Honor, but I do believe that it is consistent with the intent of the formation of the tax court to provide a prepayment forum to especially avoid hardship and the potential even of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.166" offset="920935">It's very consistent with that pattern to say that the larger taxpayer can afford to pay the tax and sue, whereas the smaller taxpayer may be in greater need of a prepayment forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.179" offset="972970">It's also consistent with imposing the very short limitation period for bringing an action in the tax court, because there the government has a very vested interest in being able to proceed with collection of the tax.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="219.672" stopTime="228.839">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="219.672" offset="1026992">But why would you not want some... a larger taxpayer to be able to proceed in the tax court if you can also proceed in the claims court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_e_redding" startTime="228.839" stopTime="347.525">
            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Redding</label>
            <text syncTime="228.839" offset="1063668">Your Honor, I can't speak to Congress's reasoning behind that but I can understand the logic behind saying we're going to create a special prepayment remedy that allows the smaller taxpayer an expedited means of resolving these issues without having to first pay it and sue, whereas the larger taxpayer is not put into a hardship position, is not inconvenienced as bad by having to follow the old well established procedures of pay and sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.295" offset="1173486">And I will note that 6404(h) does not apply only to 6404(e)(1), which is the subsection we're coming under.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.042" offset="1208490">6404(h) applies to all of the abatement grounds under Section 6404.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.631" offset="1238793">And if we were to repeal jurisdiction in the district court and the Court of Federal Claims over all of those provisions, then we would be completely taking away a remedy that has been there all along to the larger taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.751" offset="1295321">But to create a new remedy that is consistent with the pattern that allows a small taxpayer access to a prepayment forum, I think is completely consistent with the entire history of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.369" offset="1345790">This court meaning the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.245" offset="1353313">And its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.715" offset="1359165">In evaluating two statutes that appear to either conflict or overlap, I think it is, in reviewing whatever doctrine you call it, whatever canon you call it of interpretation, it appears to me that what this Court has always done is to look to see if the two statutes can be harmonized rather than seeing if one supersedes the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.735" offset="1467207">And here considering the extension of prepayment jurisdiction to the tax court merely an additional form of prepayment jurisdiction being granted to the tax court is completely consistent with the long-standing pattern of pay and sue jurisdiction in the district courts, prepayment jurisdiction in the tax court--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="347.525" offset="1538365">But you have no basis for an abatement of interest action apart from 6404(h), correct?</text>
            <text syncTime="356.724" offset="1575145">That is the only place you get the actual cause of action to sue for abatement of interest?</text>

            <text syncTime="362.284" offset="1597401">--Abatement as a prepayment remedy, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.595" offset="1610672">Once the IRS has failed to abate the interest and you make payment then you have the normal refund, refund provisions available.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.075" offset="1648601">But what would you cite to, in response to the prior cases that said you had no cause of action for abasement of interest?</text>

            <text syncTime="383.135" offset="1680784">Actually Your Honor I don't believe that's what the cases said.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.960" offset="1696144">They said you had no cause of action that could be pursued under 6404(e)(1) but even the seminal cases, Horton... or Selman and Horton Homes compared a Section 6404(e)(1) action to a Section 6404(e)(2) action and basically said you could have brought a refund claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.452" offset="1770123">If you qualified under (e)(2) there would have been no impediment to bringing that as a refund action because there was a clearly established standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.418" offset="1805963">The (e)(2) provision is a must standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.495" offset="1814218">Now, under 6404(h) if it is exclusive over abatement jurisdiction, then any taxpayer who would have had access to the courts, for example for an (e)(2) abatement case, unless they are a small taxpayer they will be completely denied any remedy whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2965.362" offset="12009705">The other, the other anomaly the Fifth Circuit identified was the taxpayer, the taxpayer seeking a refund having to split off his claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.468" offset="12054113">This too is not a significant anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.499" offset="12062264">The vast majority of taxpayers seek redetermination of their tax liability in the tax court and those taxpayers must split their claims because the interest abatement claim doesn't ripen until the taxpayer's underlying liability has been assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.369" offset="12109806">Moreover, the interest abatement question is distinct from the taxpayer's underlying liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.330" offset="12637584">In the legislative history of the 6404(h) it concludes with the statement that no inference should be made from that legislation as to other courts' jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.560" offset="12674574">I think that should be taken very seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.716" offset="12683142">As to the claims court--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3134.855" offset="12687739">Who said that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Redding</label>
            <text syncTime="3135.744" offset="12691292">--That's in a House committee report, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.914" offset="12703935">As to claim splitting, it is actually a horrendous problem when you're talking especially about partnership-related cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.489" offset="12738208">I will note that there are several hundred cases below waiting the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.489" offset="12758270">As in the Cramer and Weiner opinions that came out of the Fifth Circuit, the Court can note that there are claims for interest abatement, abatement not under 6404, but that interest was overcharged by applying the penalty rate of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.718" offset="12823158">There is a refund claim for the penalty portion of the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.229" offset="12833189">There is also a refund claim that the tax was assessed outside the statute of limitations; that's clearly a refund claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.668" offset="12858998">None of those claims would be encompassed under 6404(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.728" offset="12871224">These taxpayers would have had to have completely split their claims, asked for an interest abatement in the tax court for abuse of discretion on 6404(e)(1).</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3191.877" offset="12915841">But the point that Mr. Marcus just made, that the issue is discrete on interest abatement, and it involves mishandling within the Internal Revenue processing, and it's not like other questions that have to do with the... with the intricacies of the Internal Revenue Code--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_e_redding" startTime="3209.589" stopTime="3405.478">
            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Redding</label>
            <text syncTime="3209.589" offset="12986685">That's only relatively true to 6404(e)(1), Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.588" offset="13006642">But I will note that under 6404(a), where cases are now coming out of the tax court for the first time, because it now has jurisdiction under (h), it provides authority for the Commissioner to abate interest where the IRS has erroneously or illegally assessed the tax liability after the statute of limitations runs or whether it's simply an erroneous assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.736" offset="13095250">Those claims have nothing to do with discretion, and they are not really just ancillary to the tax liability; they arise out of the substantive challenge to the liability itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.592" offset="13134642">The Woodrall case that has come out, which is the, I think is the first of the 6404(a) cases, was an assertion that the interest had been charged after the tax had been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.290" offset="13173408">Now that's not a discretionary abatement; that's an illegal assessment of interest and that's a 6404(h) claim now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.695" offset="13203083">Previously it would have been strictly a refund claim under 16... under 1346.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.674" offset="13222936">I would also note that in terms of the being able to pay it to cut off the interest accrual, that in these cases, these cases that are before the Court, the F quality... the document the Government first sent out proposing adjustments to the partnership level, if you had computed the liability based on what the Government's position was, the ultimate tax liability including interest to any point in time would have been at least three times the amount that results from the tax court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.211" offset="13337144">It's just ludicrous to say that the taxpayer should be expected to take whatever the Government's proposed adjustments are, compute what his maximum liability may be, and pay it in advance or post a bond in advance in order to cut off the interest accrual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.705" offset="13395135">That argument just doesn't... in my mind does not fly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.780" offset="13411436">This, this Court in Bob Jones University did address the pay and sue versus prepayment jurisdiction issue in terms of constitutionality and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.620" offset="13474757">And, and basically said that as long as there is a pay and sue remedy available, the taxpayer has no due process rights to a prepayment remedy, but that the Court might have come down differently had there been no remedy available in terms of pay and sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.128" offset="13544765">I would also note that both the tax court, the district courts, the Court of Federal Claims and the appellate courts have long reviewed other discretionary acts within the tax code by the Commissioner where no standard is set forth on an abuse of discretion standard, such as the authorization of the Commissioner to abate certain penalties where the taxpayer has sought an independent appraisal on the overvaluation penalty under 6659.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.957" offset="13680079">Those cases have been reviewed for years by the tax court and by the district courts in refund cases on an abuse of discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.953" offset="13724069">It is the Federal common law standard for reviewing an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.264" offset="13737339">The determinations in Horton and Selman Holmes are unique in holding that it's totally discretionary.</text>
