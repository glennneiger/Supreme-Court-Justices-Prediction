            <text syncTime="1533.398" offset="6288321">The State sees this as having two distinct components in a situation where a passenger is subject to a, in a vehicle that's subjected to a routine traffic stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.706" offset="6337536">First, you have the stopping of the vehicle, the physical stopping of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.193" offset="6355508">In our view that does not result in a seizure of a passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.478" offset="6376615">It's a show of authority much like Hodari D discussed, which is directed at the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.917" offset="6402424">The driver is the operator of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.733" offset="6413604">When the driver submits to that show of authority, under this Court's precedents the driver is seized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.020" offset="6522796">You would still say that, that the show of authority is only directed at the driver and hence it is only the driver that's seized?</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.564" offset="6593013">By necessity, the show of authority to stop if it's done in a routine manner, as was done here, is directed at the driver.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.196" offset="12155528">Whereas again in the traffic stop I think it's, it is probably the most likely place that a citizen encounters a policeman, much more so than a, an officer approaching me at an airport and saying, can I see your identification, or approaching me on a street corner, or, as in Chesternut, following me as I'm walking home in his squad car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.846" offset="12262107">Those seem to me to be more anxiety-creating and yet the Court has held that those are consensual encounters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.750" offset="12293768">And in the parked car, there's ambiguity about what the police want, whereas in the routine traffic stop there isn't that ambiguity, so there's no reason why the passenger shouldn't feel free to leave.</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.728" offset="12561679">And the... and the comparison with the parked car and the other consensual encounter cases of this Court in my view indicate that there is nothing that's been done to the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.136" offset="12607237">I mean, the arrest of one person as this Court said in Drayton does not mean that everyone around him is detained so it doesn't seem to the State that anything has been done to the passenger.</text>

I don't think it's really, it's really far-fetched to argue that it's reasonably foreseeable that automobiles often have passengers in them, and there is certainly a large body of statutory law at least in California that shows that the car can be stopped for reasons related to the passenger.</text>
