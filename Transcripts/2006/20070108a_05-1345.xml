            <text syncTime="12.641" offset="202345">The barriers to interstate commerce imposed by the flow control ordinances in this case are even more severe than those resulting from the ordinance this Court struck down in Carbone.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.798" offset="251037">As in Carbone, no local waste can leave the counties for processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="270890">In addition, now that Respondent's landfill is up and running no local waste can leave the counties for disposal either.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.589" offset="302132">The issue here is whether Carbone is inapplicable to this outright embargo merely because Respondent's own the facilities to which the haulers are required to bring the waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.914" offset="351452">The answer is no, and the reason is that the concerns underlying the Commerce Clause are implicated whether interstate commerce was being obstructed for the benefit of a public enterprise or a private one.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.840" offset="407145">The whole point of the Commerce Clause was to promote the national economy and to put an end to parochial barriers to interstate trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.964" offset="447687">This Court has consistently held that embargoes, local processing requirements, and other barriers to interstate commerce violate the Commerce Clause because such laws inevitably prompt resentment, retaliation, and ultimately--</text>

            <text syncTime="105.318" offset="573074">And I thought it was fairly common for a municipally owned pipeline, gas pipeline, or electricity distribution to say, if you live in our town you've got to buy from us; you've got to buy from the local community.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.827" offset="631171">And I guess that's been going on for about 110 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.195" offset="644650">And yet I've never seen anybody think or write or anything that that violated the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.933" offset="671608">But of course, there could be somebody in another State who'd like to sell electricity to the people in our town.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.958" offset="927608">And that was common and it was called a service area, and in the local town, the service area, I never even heard of a company trying to come in and sell from abroad, because I thought that this certificate gave them an exclusive right to provide the local electricity service or the natural gas service.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.372" offset="1009319">I mean, it's a fairly obvious thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.796" offset="4403043">Indeed the best way to accomplish recycling is to charge volume-based fees to, to the... between the haulers and the, and the generators.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.434" offset="4529580">None of these people have flow... none of these communities have flow control but there's a direct straightforward way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.371" offset="12345313">First of all, I think this Court has answered that question with respect to waste management more than a hundred years ago in the California Reduction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.609" offset="12374256">It was clearly held there the provision of waste management services is an essential function that governments appropriately provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.113" offset="12408320">So that's been answered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.465" offset="12413649">With respect to this question about hamburgers and other services that look commercial, I think there are two checks on those kinds of ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.487" offset="12445727">First of all, I think it is very likely that in most circumstances if you were to say that hamburgers will be sold at a government operated facility, that that would disadvantage local interests significantly, and there would be a political process check.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.331" offset="12505182">Secondly the Court has been clear that it is not bound by formalistic distinctions in the Commerce Clause arena and so it will look for discrimination that is protectionist in nature whether it is, as the Court has said, forthright or ingenious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.971" offset="12555755">So if case were to present itself, and the facts in the facts in this case no whiff of that protectionism, where you were to believe that the motive of a government entity was, in fact, to favor some local private interest, then strict scrutiny might be appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.049" offset="12832026">Several of you asked about whether or not there are other mechanisms that the localities could use to further these goals, goals which are set forth in both Federal and State laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.648" offset="12922410">The Second Circuit concluded and rightly so I think on page 20a of the appendix to the petition that there was no other option that presented itself in the record that the counties could address, or could use to address their liability concerns and to encourage recycling across a very wide range of products.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.487" offset="13373806">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.273" offset="13380911">The first point I'd like to make is I'd like to ask the Court to review Reeves versus Stake which is a market participant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.379" offset="13417378">But what is significant there... that's the cement plant case... there's two significant things about that case which I think are of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.449" offset="13445590">First, the Court's footnote 1 is an interesting historical footnote about how South Dakota had elected to make a lot of these different industries state-run industries, so the hypotheticals we've been discussing are not completely off the wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.994" offset="13515807">If you can do it for waste you can do it for, in that case coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.481" offset="13533780">They wanted to do it for stockyards but I think the legislature rejected the government's proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.135" offset="13556349">So the hypos are right on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.170" offset="13568470">Secondly, the Court made a point there in rejecting the argument, the constitutional argument that the state was not prohibiting competing cement companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.812" offset="13619043">And I think the inference from that is that it had, there would have been a Commerce Clause problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.966" offset="13639732">Second, Mr. Cahill's user... user fee point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.284" offset="13660944">I just want to remind the Court that in addition to paying for the recycling and everything, they were using the user fee to pay off the bond for their failed energy recovery facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.558" offset="13702008">So, if you start focusing on what you use it for, it is a very slippery slope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.629" offset="13722384">On his point about protecting the generator from liability, we've addressed that at great lengths in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.068" offset="13756134">But one other point I want to make is he's wrong about their ability to determine whether other facilities that the haulers want to use are safe for environmental purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.507" offset="13797825">That's exactly what the city of New York does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.126" offset="13808379">Because it doesn't have its own disposal facility, its got very stringent requirements for where the waste can be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.913" offset="13835442">Fourth, Justice Souter, I believe you were raising an inquiry about the political process and whether that's adequate to protect the out of State interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.706" offset="13886642">And I'd like to refer you to the West Lynn Creamery decision where the Court said the people whose oxen are being gored by a tariff are the local residents as well, but a tariff is the prototypical Commerce Clause violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.299" offset="13945052">The political process is simply not a good answer to our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.636" offset="13974413">In terms of your other question about--</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.905" offset="13983399">A tariff is also imposed by a State, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.891" offset="14007432">It would go to a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.177" offset="14016523">I suppose it could be done by a subdivision, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.145" offset="14032405">On Ms. Halligan's point about California Reduction, I just would like to remind the Court that that was a case of flow control to a private company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.770" offset="14074932">So Carbone, to the extent that case was concerned at all with the Commerce Clause, and it didn't say that it was, it was a taking case, I think, it has been overruled to the extent it had any Commerce Clause implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.561" offset="14130103">Finally, I would like end with the point that Carbone has been the law for 13 years... may I finish?</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.616" offset="14158315">If the Respondents have a problem with Carbone, Congress can fix it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.254" offset="14188826">That's one of the unique things about the Commerce Clause that is different from other constitutional provisions.</text>
