            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="5.610" offset="112213">The first case that I have to announce is Cunningham against California, No. 05-6551.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.650" offset="152441">John Cunningham was tried in the California State Court and convicted by a jury of a grade B felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.483" offset="187759">Under California’s Determinate Sentencing Law (DSL) Cunningham’s crime was punishable by one of three precise terms of imprisonment, a lower-term sentence of 6 years, a middle-term of 12 years, or an upper-term of 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.878" offset="277307">The DSL required the trial judge to sentence Cunningham to the 12 year middle-term and nothing more unless the judge found at least one additional fact in aggravation of the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.185" offset="346583">The judge found by preponderance of evidence several aggravating facts but only one mitigating fact concluding that the aggravator outweighed the sole mitigator, the judge sentenced Cunningham to the upper term of 16 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.824" offset="425055">The California Court of Appeal affirmed the harsher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.878" offset="445326">We reverse that disposition because the four year sentence alleviation based solely on a judge’s fact finding denied Cunningham his Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.197" offset="498616">In Apprendi v. New Jersey, we held that under the Sixth Amendment any fact other than a prior conviction that exposes a defendant to a sentence above the otherwise applicable statutory maximum must be found by a jury ,not a judge, for other this sentence elevating facts must be established beyond a reasonable doubt not by a mere preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.719" offset="608644">Four years later in Blakely v. Washington we applied the rule stated in Apprendi to the Washington Sentencing Reform Act under that Act the maximum penalty for Blakely’s offense, was 10 years imprisonment but if the trial judge found no facts beyond those reflected in the jury’s verdict Blakely could not receive a sentence above a standard range of 49 to 53 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.681" offset="716477">Blakely was sentenced to 90 months imprison based on the judge’s finding of deliberate cruelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.781" offset="748974">Applying the rule recognized in Apprendi we held like these sentence unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.047" offset="778022">Last term in United States v. Booker we held the Federal Sentencing Guidelines unconstitutional as a mandatory system.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.248" offset="814802">There was no meaningful distinction we observe between the federal guidelines and the Washington system invalidated in Blakely.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.864" offset="849284">Both systems exposed defendants to greater punishment based solely on facts found by judges not juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.353" offset="883243">As a remedy for the Sixth Amendment violation we determine that the federal guideline should remain operative but as advisory only informing but not finding the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.459" offset="935592">We also held that sentences imposed under an advisory guidelines regime could be subject to appellate review or reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.451" offset="975612">In all material respect, California’s DSL resembles the sentencing systems invalidated in Blakely and Booker because aggravating facts that authorize the upper-term are found by the judge under California system and maybe established by a preponderance of the evidence and assessment less confining then beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.063" offset="1078012">We hold that the DSL violates the rules stated in Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.527" offset="1095880">In People v. Black, the California Supreme Court attempted to rescue the DSL’s judicial factfinding authorization by describing the system as imposing only a reasonableness constraint equivalent to the constraint operative in the federal system for Booker.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.147" offset="1174352">The reasonableness check the Booker court anticipated however would operates within constitutional constraints delineated in this Court’s precedent and not as a substitute for those constraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.502" offset="1235792">Because the DSL allocates to judges sole authority to find facts on which the imposition of an upper term sentence turns the system violates the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.003" offset="1281767">The remedy prescribed in Booker, in short, is not properly regarded as a recipe for rendering this Court’s Sixth Amendment case law toothless.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.566" offset="1324085">As to the adjustment of California sentencing system in light of our ruling the ball lies in California’s court.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.910" offset="1353447">Several States have modified their systems in the wake of Apprendi and Blakely to retain determinate sentencing, by calling upon the jury to find any fact necessary to the imposition of an elevated sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.374" offset="1419276">Other States have chosen to permit judges genuinely “to exercise broad discretion within a statutory range”, for example a range running from 6-16 years without a mandatory middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.899" offset="1477372">California may follow the path taken by its sister States or otherwise alter its system, so long as it observes Sixth Amendment limitations declared in this Court’s decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.132" offset="1530348">Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Breyer joins, Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Kennedy and Breyer join.</text>
