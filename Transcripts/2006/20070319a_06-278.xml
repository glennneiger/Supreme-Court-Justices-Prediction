            <text syncTime="3547.130" offset="14343918">That's the one that hinges on the fact that he was not among the released students.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.480" offset="14449349">For the reasons that have been discussed, under no circumstances should Deborah Morse, a conscientious principal, be subjected to the possibility of punitive damages or compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.365" offset="14496891">A very brief factual point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.069" offset="14503683">In light of the richness of the discussion with respect to the facts, I would guide the Court to page 109 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.658" offset="14534090">This is Deborah Morse's interrogatory answer and there she sets forth the facts, and that bleeds into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.622" offset="14561884">To promote drugs... and this is our fundamental suggestion and submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.914" offset="14583096">To promote drugs is utterly inconsistent with the basic educational mission of the school, and for this Court to suggest to the contrary would really be quite inconsistent with much of its drug jurisprudence, Bernonia and Earls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.766" offset="14646521">The opinion of the Court in Earls 2002 is especially powerful with respect to the scourge of drugs and their dangers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.292" offset="14684555">More broadly, the Court does not need to go more broadly, but the Court has spoken more broadly with respect to the need to defer to school officials in identifying the educational mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.005" offset="14727396">But we know that there are in fact constitutional limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.238" offset="14740353">Those limits are captured in Tinker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.675" offset="14750070">A passive pure political speech that reflects on the part of the school board a standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.448" offset="14813182">We are light years away from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.994" offset="14823422">I thank the Court.</text>
