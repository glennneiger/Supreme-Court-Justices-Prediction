            <text syncTime="9.597" offset="192754">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.391" offset="207905">Complaints alleging violations of the FCC's pay phone compensation regulations allege just that, violations of regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.886" offset="245939">The regulatory violations do not give rise to private cause of action under section 206 and 207 of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.430" offset="276032">The proper point of departure in this case begins at section 276.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.523" offset="296408">There Congress directed the FCC to create a system guaranteeing pay phone providers compensation for the services that they provide to callers who make dial around calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.551" offset="336532">There can be little doubt that the FCC has ample authority to enforce the system it created administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.528" offset="360460">But nothing in Section 276 or anywhere else in the Act contemplates that violations of the FCC's implementing regulations should give rise to a private cause of action for damages in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.684" offset="405077">Accordingly, this Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision allowing pay phone operators to bring through the back door the kinds of cases that Congress declined to allow through the front.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.019" offset="446455">There's nothing upsetting about reaching that result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.472" offset="460248">The Communications Act quite sensibly limits private damages actions in Federal court to those alleging violations of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.020" offset="494416">And claims that long distance providers... I'm sorry... claims that long distance providers have violated the pay phone compensation regulations require the parsing and the application of the extraordinarily complex and ever-changing FCC rules and regulations and orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.879" offset="4669828">And, therefore, the long distance facility in every pay phone case is using the pay phone in order to get the customer to what the long distance facility provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.970" offset="4730223">Why then isn't it just as fair to characterize the use of the pay phone here as for the benefit of the carrier as for the benefit of the customer?</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.806" offset="5077547">So to calculate that 24 cents, it is purely a function of the amount of money that the caller owes the pay phone operator.</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.874" offset="5601877">And so another way to understand the distinction between the accounting rules, the rate making exercises and all the rest in this case is that section 201(b) of the Act doesn't cover everything in connection with a communications service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.412" offset="7539954">Now, what Mr. Fisher's argument amounts to is to say that if it is covered in a regulation, it is exempted from being called an unjust or unreasonable charge, classification, practice, et cetera, because that would allow the FCC to enforce too much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2117.171" offset="8622990">We cited the second half of section 201(a) not to say it applies of its own force here, but to say that it disproves the contention that the communications services referred to in the phrase such communications service in 201(b) have to be limited to carrier-customer relations, because 201(a) isn't limited to carrier-customer relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.502" offset="8696342">Yes, all 201(a) does of its own force is allow the prescribing of through routes and interconnections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.517" offset="8716404">But there is no possible way to read 201(b) as limited to carrier-carrier communications in light of the full breadth of practices covered by 201(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.940" offset="8754125">So that's the reason to cite 201(a) is simply to disprove Mr. Fisher's contention about the limits on 201(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.624" offset="9128826">In other words, the world would look quite different without a regulatory scheme, but it would not be a regulatory scheme in which they get all the money they are currently purporting to keep.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.078" offset="9162680">Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you also asked a question about the flash point on whether the FCC was improperly or suspiciously commenting on the scope of the private right of action as opposed to interpreting a substantive provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.860" offset="9225792">The private right of action provisions are 206 through 208, the provisions that let the complainant go to either court or the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.343" offset="9255676">The FCC said nothing controversial about the scope of 206 through 208.</text>

            <text syncTime="2296.959" offset="9342194">It is not a matter of the FCC reaching out to say, we are going to create a private right of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.674" offset="9489002">And this is quite important, that it is their business, because 208 is the provision under which each and every one of those Commission proceedings cited in the Sprint brief, which Mr. Fisher alluded to, has proceeded before the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.491" offset="9528290">208, just like 206, requires a violation of the Act, so it is very much their business to decide whether these pay phone controversies state violations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.387" offset="9567892">If they don't, the Commission has absolutely no power to proceed under 208, which is the only provision under which any administrative proceeding has ever gone forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.012" offset="9598403">There are some arguments made here that they clearly have the authority to proceed administratively even if you can't go to court, but Mr. Fisher hasn't identified the source of that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.178" offset="9639049">And the sources identified in the brief are section 4(i), which has been problematic, and others... and other sections on which the FCC has never relied on in this setting, and some kind of divination of an action within Section 276 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.868" offset="9693802">The question was put at one point to Mr. Fisher, could the FCC mandate fee-shifting as part of this administrative remedy it's going to create.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.723" offset="9725253">Well, if you read 276 broadly, it's giving the Commission great powers to create administrative remedies, notwithstanding 208, which was supposed to be the administrative provision, then maybe anything goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.129" offset="9762870">But we're getting awfully far from the statute that Congress wrote and giving the FCC awfully expansive powers to construe 276, while also denying the FCC rather mundane powers to construe rather ordinary phrases of administrative law, 201(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.461" offset="9828176">Now, with respect to the question of whether this is a practice in connection with a communications service, Mr. Fisher argues strenuously that it is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.848" offset="10125763">But there's another angle of approach for that issue, which is that in the Louisiana Service... Louisiana Public Service Commission case, this Court was asked to draw the inference, just as it has been in this Court, from other provisions in the Communications Act, that those phrases always refer to carrier-customer relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.990" offset="10190337">And the Court said, no, that phrase can also refer to depreciation rules, so it's not limited to carrier-customer relations, the inference from other provisions of the Act doesn't flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.276" offset="10227431">And the reason is there are words of limitation when those words,</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.788" offset="10249479">are used in those other sections that make it clear that they apply only to tariffed services.</text>

            <text syncTime="2534.765" offset="10293364">Now, there remains the argument that there's a mismatch between section 201 and the relevant regulations because the regulations apply to intrastate as well as interstate calls, and section 201 applies to interstate or foreign communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.034" offset="10346445">That argument appears for the very first time in merits briefing in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.040" offset="10378524">And that's a problem, because the limits of the FCC's ability to regulate jurisdictionally mixed communications depend on factual determinations, factual determinations neither the agency nor even the lower courts have ever been given a chance to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.110" offset="10438814">But had this issue been raised in a timely fashion, I suggest that it would have been appropriate for the FCC to reach intrastate as well as interstate communications because long distance... dial-around calls are overwhelmingly long distance, overwhelmingly interstate, and it is difficult to sort out which calls are which.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.584" offset="10520734">In fact, the seven years of rulemaking the FCC underwent in this case largely were because of the difficulties of keeping track of particular pay phone calls.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.446" offset="10900137">Global Closing doesn't even try to defend the Ninth and D.C. Circuits' reasoning that the statute does not contain rights-creating language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.731" offset="10925319">That leaves the tricky question whether a violation of the regs can be deemed a violation of the Act itself when Congress specified only the right, but didn't specify what fair compensation was, and didn't specify who had to pay the compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.118" offset="10978817">In that respect, I think Alexander v. Sandoval, though it's been cited against us repeatedly, is actually helpful to our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.102" offset="11002746">That case says it's meaningless talk about a violation of the regs separate from a violation of the Act, and that a Congress that intends an Act to be enforced intends the regulations filling out the Act to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.421" offset="11052065">I think the theory of Chevron itself is also helpful to our position in this regard, because the point of Chevron is that the use of broad language constitutes an administrative... a delegation of authority to the administrative agency, not just to fill in details, but to give definitive content to a statute whose direct content is less than definitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.324" offset="11135657">So it is perfectly appropriate to talk about this statute, section 276, and its rights-creating language as ordering the FCC not just to create a plan, but ordering the FCC to create a plan that has a particular goal such that violation of that goal can be deemed a violation of section 276 itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2867.856" offset="11625818">In those provisions, Congress found it necessary to say, okay, we have to now give you the authority to create a damage action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="3336.448" offset="13500156">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.291" offset="13515516">Let me begin, Mr. Chief Justice, with your question about whether the FCC can opine on remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.316" offset="13535578">All you need to do is look to what the FCC was telling everybody it was deciding in these order proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.000" offset="13566403">It was deciding, and asked for notice and comment, on whether PSPs have a remedy for violations of the pay phone regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.575" offset="13592630">That is cited everywhere in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.947" offset="13598168">It never asked for notice and comments, or considered whether failure to pay under the regulations is a violation of 201(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.412" offset="13623977">So the question this Court needs to ask itself is when the FCC, by its own acknowledgment, until now, is simply opining on the presence of a Federal court remedy, whether it gets deference simply because it hangs the hook on a substantive provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.799" offset="13677580">Now, there are three problems with what the FCC has done in construing section 201.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.272" offset="13699418">The first is that this is not a covered practice, because I want to make clear our position, it's that the FCC has plenty of authority with respect to carrier-customer relationships, but not with respect to carrier-supplier relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.750" offset="13745394">And that's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.902" offset="13749991">On unjust and unreasonable, I think we need to unpack two separate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.844" offset="13769740">One is whether the rate the FCC chose is reasonable, whether the amount of money that it said needs to be put into pay phone operators' pockets is a fair and reasonable choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.201" offset="13803177">We have no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.762" offset="13809446">And we think that in and of itself could generate deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.112" offset="13826791">But the FCC's determination to put the payment obligation on long distance carriers simply can't be shoehorned into the unjust and unreasonable phrase in 201(b), because if that's... the only reason why anything, us failing to pay the money, would be because of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.544" offset="13892515">And you hear it again and again in their argument, the FCC having concluded that long distance companies are the ones that pay, the failure to pay is unjust and unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.219" offset="13923235">There's no way to get there without the regulations, and that's what distinguishes--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3444.653" offset="13932953">That's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.511" offset="13936401">You can say that this is a way you make a lot of money from your customers that you wouldn't otherwise make, because if there wasn't a pay phone there, they wouldn't be able to use your service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.067" offset="13970674">--The FCC might have said that, but as I said to Justice Souter, that would be a very different proceeding and a very different scheme than we have here, and a very different dollar figure or cent figure that the FCC might have come up with when it was trying to encapsulate that figure, which we think is zero, but under your reasoning may be something very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.459" offset="14036189">But that would be a very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.830" offset="14045697">Two more things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.971" offset="14050190">One is, on the jurisdictional mismatch question, Mr. Chief Justice, you are exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.132" offset="14066909">It is not hard... there are plenty of hard things in this case, but figuring out whether a call is interstate or intrastate is not one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.958" offset="14094181">All you need to know is where the call originated from, and the number that was dialed, and pay phone operators have that information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.379" offset="14171921">--I think it still constitutes a long distance call, depending on where the cell phone owner lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.384" offset="14191879">And that's still an easy thing to figure out, where the area code is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.787" offset="14205462">Finally, Justice Stevens, you asked a question about the co-extensive nature of the remedies under 206 and 208.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.259" offset="14231376">We don't dispute that the statute itself is co-extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.251" offset="14243392">What we're saying is that 276 gives the FCC more than ample authority to do what it's doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.826" offset="14269619">Nobody has denied that, and so we think that that's the place to look for the FCC to craft the arrangement under Southwestern Cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.052" offset="14298563">Combined with section 154(i), the FCC would have ample authority to do that.</text>
