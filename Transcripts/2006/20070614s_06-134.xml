            <text syncTime="8.946" offset="125750">First case I have is The Permanent Mission of India, et al. versus The City of New York, 06-0134.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.655" offset="180607">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Courts of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.256" offset="211013">For several years New York City has levied property taxes against the Permanent Mission of India to the United States and the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the portions of their New York buildings used to house lower level employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.850" offset="285410">Petitioners have refused to pay those taxes by operation of the New York Law the unpaid taxes converted into tax liens and the City sought a declaration in State Court that the tax liens were valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.013" offset="354060">Petitioners remove to Federal Court and argued that they were immune from the suits under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.166" offset="402647">The District Court disagreed relying on the acts exception to immunity for “immovable property” which provides that a foreign state shall not be immune from jurisdiction in any case in which “rights and immovable property situated in the United States are in the issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="100.400" offset="491568">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.642" offset="504525">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.897" offset="529498">We hold that an action seeking a declaration of the validity of a tax lien places rights and immovable property in the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.025" offset="566070">Contrary to petitioners’ position, the immovable property exception does not expressly limit itself to cases in which the specific right at issue is titled ownership or possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.887" offset="617478">Rather the exception focuses more broadly on rights in property.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.258" offset="639003">At the time, of the acts adoption in 1976, Black’s Law Dictionary defined a lien as a charge or security or incumbrance upon property.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.610" offset="684352">Incumbrance in turn was defined as “any right or interest in land which may subsist in another to the diminution of its value.”</text>
            <text syncTime="159.700" offset="728760">The most recent edition of Black’s similarly defines lien as a “legal right or interest that a creditor has in another’s property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="169.887" offset="769511">The practical effects of a lien are consistent with these definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.988" offset="789887">A lien on real property runs with the land and is enforceable against subsequent purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.633" offset="816532">As such a lien has an immediate adverse effect upon the amount to which property could be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.941" offset="845684">This constitutes a direct interference with the property and inhibits one of the quintessential rights property ownership the right to convey.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.623" offset="884450">It is therefore plain that a suit to establish the validity of a lien implicates rights and immovable property.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.346" offset="915379">Two well recognized and related purposes of the act adoption of the restrictive view of sovereign immunity and codification of international law at the time of the acts enactment support our reading of the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.290" offset="971072">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Breyer has joined.</text>
