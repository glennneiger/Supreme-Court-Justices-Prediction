            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="89901">I have the announcement in two cases this morning the first is number 05-1541, EC Term of Years Trust versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.753" offset="136817">Justice Souter has authored the opinion in this case, and he has asked me to announce it for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.670" offset="156565">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.774" offset="180912">The internal revenue service determined that Elmer and Dorothy Cullers claimed unwarranted income tax deductions in the 1980s but by the time the government tried to collect from the Cullers’ they have transferred some of their assets to petitioner EC Term of Years Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.986" offset="249770">The IRS levied on the Trust’s bank account and collected over $3 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.453" offset="271713">Almost a year after that the Trust filed an action claiming that the IRS has wrongfully levied on it’s property to collect taxes owed by another.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.862" offset="309330">Such wrongful levy actions are specifically authorized by statute, but they are subject to a nine month filing deadline because the Trust had missed that deadline the District Court dismissed it’s complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.653" offset="364500">The Trust then re-filed its action as a claim for a tax refund which has a less demanding filing deadline, but the District Court dismissed it again reasoning that a wrongful levy claim was the Trust’s only recourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.735" offset="420820">The Fifth Circuit affirmed and we granted certiorari to resolve a conflict with the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.538" offset="447988">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.484" offset="463765">We have repeatedly held that when Congress creates a precisely drawn and detailed statute it preempts more general remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.577" offset="496157">Here Congress specifically tailored a remedy for third parties challenging a wrongful levy and provided a nine month statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.543" offset="528027">That short period was no accident since the IRS must be promptly be told if it has seized property from the wrong party.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.775" offset="560941">But this deadline could be easily awaited if as the Trust argues third parties could always reformulate their wrongful levy claim as one for a tax refund, resort to a tax refund claim is therefore preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.334" offset="619142">The trust also relies on United States against Williams, a case in which we held that a wrongful lien claim could be brought in the form of a tax refund action.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.741" offset="660833">But we said in Williams that no remedy other than a tax refund was open to the plaintiff in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.077" offset="694165">Here on the other hand, the Trust challenges a levy not a lien and could have made a timely wrongful levy claim for the relief it now seeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.857" offset="733245">Justice Souter’s opinion for the Court is unanimous.</text>
