            <text syncTime="6.389" offset="176792">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is here following this Court's remand to the Oregon courts to reconsider their decision in light of State Farm, a task at which we submit the Oregon courts completely failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.944" offset="234992">It presents two independent but thematically interrelated issues, both of which implicate what the Court said in State Farm, which is that, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="30.581" offset="273549">"courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered. "</text>
            <text syncTime="40.562" offset="313464">Now significantly, Respondent defends neither... oh, I should stop for a minute and describe the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.059" offset="343453">So the first issue is whether the Oregon Supreme Court properly held that Philip Morris was correctly denied an instruction which would have told the jury that it was not to punish for harm to nonparties.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.100" offset="403639">The Oregon Supreme Court held that that instruction was legally incorrect, it was proper for the jury to punish for harm to nonparties, and therefore the instruction was correctly denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.795" offset="478454">The key paragraph from number 34 which is set forth at page 4 of our brief, as well as numerous other places in the materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.995" offset="507188">It says, the size of any punishment should bear reasonable relationship to the harm caused to Jesse Williams by the defendant's punishable misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.181" offset="535923">Although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what that reasonable relationship is, you're not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct of other persons who may bring lawsuits of their own, etc.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.861" offset="590676">--You don't think that would confuse the jury if they are first told that they may consider the extent of harm suffered by others, and then the next instruction seems to say they can't?</text>

            <text syncTime="127.495" offset="661206">First of all, I don't think that's what it says, and I don't think it would confuse the jury, and I'm confident that with that instruction, counsel could explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.321" offset="692553">But let me stop here, because I know this was something that Justice Scalia expressed some uncertainty about in the State Farm argument, and that the Oregon Supreme Court said they didn't clearly understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.190" offset="743962">To consider the conduct means to evaluate it in connection with assessing the blameworthiness of the conduct being punished.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>

            <text syncTime="157.499" offset="781265">If the instruction had said that, you would have a very different instruction, and I'm bothered by the instruction too for just that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.996" offset="823270">It says you may consider, and if I were a juror parsing the instruction, I would say,</text>

            <text syncTime="176.789" offset="858378">Well, the second part of it is, what punishment means is what would be done in a class action, for instance, to impose punishment for all the harm suffered by Oregon smokers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="193.157" offset="923894">Well, let me say a couple of things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.060" offset="943433">First of all, the Oregon Supreme Court did not rely on this aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.434" offset="960987">It held that it was proper to punish for harm to nonparties.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.402" offset="976870">Now this, in our view, this instruction, and there's always a danger when you add words to an instruction that you will add something that a court will find was incorrect and therefore deny the instruction, even though the essence of it was correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="219.943" stopTime="271.749">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="219.943" offset="1030996">Where did the Oregon Supreme Court say it was proper to punish for harm to nonparties?</text>
            <text syncTime="226.971" offset="1059103">Your brief quotes something to that effect, but... the sentence on page 18(a) of the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.389" offset="1100795">It says, what the Oregon court said is, Philip Morris asserts that Campbell prohibits the State acting through a civil jury from using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.335" offset="1172579">The Oregon Supreme Court on its own, I think, didn't put it in terms of harming particular nonparties, but to exposing Oregon residents to the risk of a deadly disease.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="271.749" stopTime="343.018">
            <label>Mr. Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="271.749" offset="1238199">Well, I would refer the Court to pages 20(a) to 21(a) of the appendix, where the court discusses, comes to its conclusion on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.699" offset="1274039">And it says, the instruction would have prohibited the jury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged conduct on other persons even if those persons were Oregonians who were harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.945" offset="1327015">But on 28(a) it says, because the proposed jury did not accurately reflect the law, this is not a statement about Philip Morris's position, the trial court did not commit reversible error when it refused to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.690" offset="1369960">So I think the court was quite clear in saying... let me complete my answer, because I think considering it moves the needle along the scale of allowable punishment for the harm to Jesse Williams, but it does not abandon the principle of proportionality to that harm, whereas punishing for it is what you would do in a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.305" offset="1464419">You would punish for all the harms to all the Oregonians.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.194" offset="1476018">This is a one-way class action in which Philip Morris was exposed to global punishment by the jury without any of the protections of a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.128" offset="1515724">So--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="343.018" offset="1523352">Let me... let me... let me focus the problem that I have right now this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.922" offset="1538920">If I look at the Oregon Supreme Court opinion, and particularly at the point that you mention in 20 and 21, I have to say I, I read the opinion the way you read the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.777" offset="1590329">I read them the same, just what you claimed they were saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.290" offset="1604436">The difficulty that I have is because I think the instruction that was proposed on behalf of your client was not a clear instruction, I have great difficulty in seeing how I could find that it was error to refuse to give the instruction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="381.940" stopTime="382.362">

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="382.362" offset="1680713">So my problem is, if I think they really did have the wrong view of the law but the issue was focused at the trial court by a request for an instruction which I think was properly denied, what do I do?</text>
            <text syncTime="395.670" offset="1733898">Do I concentrate on what they said in the opinion or do I concentrate on what I think was the deficiency of the instruction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="402.980" stopTime="411.007">
            <label>Mr. Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="402.980" offset="1763156">--Well, I think what you do is decide the Federal issue, which I think is whether they were correct in the legal proposition that they asserted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="411.007" stopTime="429.889">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="411.007" offset="1795234">But then they would respond, when they made that, when they gave that explanation in the Oregon Supreme Court, they were responding to a claim of error which was focused and raised at the trial level by the request for an instruction, which strikes me as probably an unsound instruction, an unsound request.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.889" offset="1870780">Well, I guess we could leave it up to them whether they want to disallow the instruction for a different reason, but the fact is they disallowed it for the reason that you say.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.326" offset="2648498">But let me try to explain the difference this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.808" offset="2662499">If you're considering the conduct in relation in determining what is the proper punishment for the harm to Jesse Williams, you should come up with a number that can be properly replicated in case after case if other juries arrived at the same conclusion about the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.584" offset="2721536">If you are punishing for the conduct, you should come up with a number that precludes further punishment for the same, punishing for the harm, further punishment for the same harm, for the same causes of action for punitive damages that various Oregonians had.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.281" offset="2784334">So there's a fundamental difference in that respect between considering and punishing for it, and the Court has said repeatedly, and I don't think we can contest this, that the character of the conduct can be considered in determining the proper level or allowable level of punitive damages, that included the character of the conduct is the intended scope of the harm, if it's an isolated incident, if it's a consistent pattern of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.536" offset="2889347">So, I don't think we could properly have told the jury that they may not consider the conduct without getting ourselves in serious trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.908" offset="2926858">So... and I don't, I don't think, and the difference is potentially enormous.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.841" offset="2958623">If you think about a jury that was deciding a punitive damages class action and a jury that was told that they had to punish for the harm to the particular plaintiff in the, in the particular case, it's, it's obvious that the results would be vastly different in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.523" offset="3021317">And the problem we were worried about was that the jury would think of itself as the punishment agency to impose statewide punishment for the harms to all Oregon smokers who were deceived by Philip Morris--</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.949" offset="12906992">And as a practical matter, the statute of ultimate repose practically prevents any future Oregon plaintiff from bringing such a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.288" offset="12944400">They would have to show that they contracted cancer or a disease from smoking within the repose period, which is eight years, if one were filed tomorrow, eight years ago, and that indeed that the fraud was a substantial factor in contracting that disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.059" offset="13039485">That is what we were put to prove in this case, the relevant date being 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.291" offset="13064458">Now imagine, that window is rapidly closing on eight years, because it was after this case that Philip Morris decided that they were no longer going to deny that smoking causes cancer and they were no longer going to deny that nicotine was addictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.348" offset="13124645">So that window is rapidly closing, and it's highly unlikely that a smoker can point to eight years ago as the point at which their cancer basically became active.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.499" offset="13173232">So as a practical matter, there is going to be no awards, future awards in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.543" offset="13197369">And as a legal matter, doctrinal matter, I believe that Oregon has taken the step necessary to prevent multiple awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.150" offset="13231851">You know, six States do not permit punitive damages in most instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.460" offset="13253063">Another 20 or so cap punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.521" offset="13269363">And then 12, of which Oregon is one, has chosen a method like this to address that duplicative award approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.221" offset="13300083">I think that kind of experimentation which is done in good faith, which has been authoritatively construed by the courts to address this question, is sufficient to address any concerns with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.981" offset="13351178">But let's, let's remember also, that while the Constitution contains many places where numbers are important, the President must be 35 years of age, it has implied in other places numbers, like in one person, one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.288" offset="13412409">But the due process clause in its spaciousness and majesty doesn't talk about numbers, and that is where the concern is only about reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.611" offset="13457654">It's about fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.986" offset="13463192">And here the Oregon legislature, supplemented by the Oregon courts, have taken those steps to properly constrain awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.435" offset="13492971">Since the decision in Oberg, there have been only 14 punitive damage decisions in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.870" offset="13518676">Four of them have been overturned entirely by the Oregon Supreme Court, so no punitive damages awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.415" offset="13544903">There are only two out of all those awards that exceed single digits, and this is one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.678" offset="13569980">So I think that the courts have done a good job there of trying to address these concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.848" offset="13590669">And one of the areas of agreement between our opponents and us is that the statement in their brief that, reprehensibility ensures that the greater wrong receives the greater punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.109" offset="13635704">But the regime that they are suggesting, one that has a categorical ratio limit and atomizes this kind of consideration so you don't look at the broader societal and public purpose, that one guarantees a regime of underdeterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.664" offset="13705921">And Oregon has, as it is their right, opted for optimal deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.224" offset="13732148">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.191" offset="13755972">Let me, let me start with, let me start with the observation that Mr. Peck has argued as though this was a class action, as though total deterrence, disgorgement, and all these things were all to be achieved in this case, which is the heart of our problem here with the denial of the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.183" offset="13823995">He referred to this other case in Oregon, which is the Schwarz case, as finding liability also, but what he didn't mention was that on the issue of the fraud relating, involving the relationship between cancer, between smoking and health, the jury found for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.989" offset="13895152">They found liability on a different issue, but not on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.503" offset="13909258">So it hardly proves that we would lose all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.627" offset="13921797">It's also true that in that case, where the jury did not receive... we asked for but we didn't get an instruction like this... the jury actually came back and said: Does our award have to be reasonably related to the injury to Mrs. Schwarz?</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.839" offset="13978640">And the judge refused to tell them the answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.540" offset="13997448">So juries do understand this problem and they do think about this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.319" offset="14020540">The suggestion was made that you can present prior awards to the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.771" offset="14042378">Now, I, I hope during my opening argument I covered the reasons why there's a structural deficiency in the system if the system even called for getting credit, which the statutes don't require.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.046" offset="14091384">But you should know that the Oregon plaintiffs' lawyers have argued that under the Oregon Constitution it must be presented to the jury or is it may not be considered by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.619" offset="14137673">So while here he wants to assure you that it can be presented to the court, that's not the position they are taking below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.039" offset="14167348">On the question by Justice Souter about whether you should send it back and what the Oregon Supreme Court meant by its discussion, if it didn't mean what we say it meant they should have reversed and said were entitled to the instruction or identified some other reason why we're not entitled to the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.859" offset="14242685">Now, there may be some independent State ground that you're not aware of, but you ought to say at a minimum that they were wrong and that a defendant in a punitive damages case is entitled to an instruction of this general nature, and then we can let the Oregon courts on remand address whether there is some other problem which we frankly don't see, but that would be for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.083" offset="14343623">Now, if Mr. Peck is right about the nature of the conduct, there should be plenty of lawsuits and plenty of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.611" offset="14381657">If there isn't, the Court can't speculate that we ought to punish Philip Morris more in this case because other people are not sufficiently aggrieved to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.952" offset="14415094">That seems to me totally impermissible speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.326" offset="14428573">On the question of harm versus conduct, the unit of prosecution is the cause of action, so that it's not, it's not, you can repeatedly... in our, in our submission you can repeatedly punish a defendant for the same conduct, for the impact of the same conduct causing injury to different people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.722" offset="14526166">What we are basically saying is that there are, there are potentially many causes of action out there for this conduct and the punishment in this case should be limited to the cause of action that is being tried before the jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.545" offset="14577471">Let's see if I... if I have anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.042" offset="14603384">Justice Stevens talked about the ambiguity of the closing argument and I agree it's not clear what plaintiff's counsel was exactly saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.804" offset="14638493">It could be interpreted in different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.161" offset="14643926">But that is a reason to have a cautionary instruction, not a reason to forgo one, to make sure the jury understands the applicable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.597" offset="14677676">Thank you.</text>
