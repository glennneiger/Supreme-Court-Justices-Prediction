            <text syncTime="11.129" offset="198117">Petitioner is before this Court because he followed an order of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.673" offset="220268">He filed his notice of appeal within the time authorized by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.906" offset="245137">It was only when the matter came before the court of appeals was it raised that the district court apparently had no authority to grant a 17-day extension, although it specified a specific date rather than the 14 days in connection with the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="40.338" offset="314936">Yes, it was authorized by the district court in the sense the district court put it on a piece of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.861" offset="336984">It wasn't authorized because the district court had no authority to extend that.</text>

            <text syncTime="54.607" offset="371988">When you look at the actual entry itself, it's a handwritten entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.469" offset="391423">There's no way of telling from the handwritten entry whether that entry was even entered on the docket on the same date because all you have is the handwritten entry, February 10, file your appeal by February 27, which is unusual in a civil case because normally in a civil case you get a judgment; you don't get a directive from the Court that you have 30 days to file a notice of appeal or anything in connection with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.899" offset="509183">So I don't think it's unreasonable to rely upon a directive from a court.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.320" offset="574802">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.509" offset="579609">When the order came out... well, first of all, we were glad to get the order to allow time to appeal; but looking at the order, or just looking at the date, something had to be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.357" offset="747002">But here certainly this order is not unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.610" offset="759958">It's certainly within the confines.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.960" offset="769362">And you have a specific end date, do your notice of appeal by this date.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.459" offset="819413">The rule said 14 days; this judge obviously made a slip.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.016" offset="849611">He miscalculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.388" offset="859119">Wouldn't a lawyer faced with what the rule clearly says and an inconsistency scribbled on an order, say the judge probably made a mistake?</text>
            <text syncTime="193.227" offset="926411">So I better, if I want to protect my client, do what the rule says?</text>

            <text syncTime="197.779" offset="944696">Well, looking back, that is probably correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.543" offset="955772">But looking at the order, and the way it came out, and the fact that you know, the... the rule allowed for a reopening of the appeal, just looking at the end date of the order, make sure the notice of appeal is filed by that date, it would seem to me that the party who is adversely affected by it may object on that basis, saying Judge, you have no authority to do this, what are you doing in connection with--</text>

            <text syncTime="231.842" offset="1080951">In terms of looking at it from some equitable sense, I don't understand why you wait toward the end of the period assuming you hadn't focused on the difference between the 14 days and the days allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.220" offset="1134450">What... why, why would you delay filing the notice of appeal?</text>

            <text syncTime="253.936" offset="1169245">And you don't want to get all briefs due within a short period of time, once you get your notice of appeal filed in a particular case, because you have time limits for getting the record, your briefing, and you know, there's a number of appeals going out... not in this Court, but you know there were a number of appeals going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.379" offset="1239044">And my normal practice is you know, file your notice of appeal near the end of the applicable appeals time.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.609" offset="1292020">In other words, you've got the 30 days to file; and then this rule allows you to... it's a safety valve, if you didn't get the notice or whatever, you've got a certain procedure that can give you the extra 14 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.096" offset="1337891">And now it seems to me that you're asking for a safety valve on top of a safety valve.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.440" offset="1355341">And I wonder if there's some point where you cut off the... allowing an out for missing the deadline.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.292" offset="1382717">Well, I suppose at some point, someone may say well, if the court gave you 180 days to do the act, someone may say well, that appears to be unreasonable in connection with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.122" offset="1426081">I think the safer thing is just to put the order down, say application, reopen the appeal time, granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.714" offset="1452412">And then it would cause someone to go you know, go back, look at the rule, see how much time is allotted under the rule in connection with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.321" offset="1482819">But I don't think it's unreasonable; in these circumstances we're only talking about three days to do an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.195" offset="1510300">The act was done in two days.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.056" offset="1517823">Well, but as soon as you start talking about an exception from the provision in the rules, then you're going to get a lot of applications and there are going to be a lot of different reasons for why it wasn't filed on the last day.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.884" offset="1565052">Once that... it seems to me, you open it up for an indeterminate ruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.860" offset="1600997">Because it allows something where an appeal time has expired, can you come in and show the circumstances, one, you were not notified, which obviously the court did.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.636" offset="1704128">No, but Justice Kennedy's point I think is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.288" offset="1710711">In other words, the drafters of the rule obviously wanted to provide a safety valve.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.231" offset="1730460">But they also appreciated that you can't have it open-ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.162" offset="1742162">So they did impose limits on the... if you want to call it equitable exception to the 30-day rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.947" offset="1773300">And it seems to me that you sort of restrike the balance the drafters of the rule struck if you allow further equitable departures from their, their rule.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Mancino Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="414.434" offset="1811335">--Well, I think in past cases the Court has always recognized there are deadlines but there are exceptions to deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.857" offset="1836935">And the most compelling exemption is where a court says do the act at this particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.002" offset="1861594">And you know, it's coming from a judicial officer, it's not coming from someone miscalculating on the calendar, calculating the time when it's 30 days run, when is 14 days run, when it's 10 days run in connection with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.592" offset="1919900">Because in civil litigation you are not given any specific time to do an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.374" offset="1939021">Criminal cases are a little bit different.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.657" offset="1952187">You are told about an appeal, when an appeal has to be filed in connection with a case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.542" offset="6555694">The petitioner's failure to meet the 14-day statutory deadline for filing his notice of appeal is fatal to his case for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.537" offset="6587668">First, the 14-day period is mandatory and jurisdictional, and Federal district courts do not have the power to enlarge this time period.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.088" offset="6649944">Third, even if there could be some sort of limited equitable exception to the 14-day time requirement, the petitioner here falls far short of demonstrating why he is entitled to such extraordinary relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.296" offset="6706786">The petitioner's claim that notice of appeal time requirements are not jurisdictional contradicts 150 years of practice, countless lower court decisions, settled congressional understanding as to the meaning of its governing--</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.890" offset="6849101">And the reason why is that notice of appeals are classically jurisdictional in that sense, in that they transfer the locus of the case from one court to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.386" offset="6887135">In the appellate system, there's actually a changing of the jurisdiction, and the notice of appeal is that triggering mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.313" offset="6918796">And in that sense, it is classically jurisdictional and different from the other kinds of time limits that this Court addressed in Kontrick, in versus Eberhart because those took place within a particular court system, the district court system, where here there was a transfer of jurisdiction triggered by the notice of appeal from one court to the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.775" offset="11500673">For four basic reasons the deadline for filing a notice of appeal in a civil case should be treated as jurisdictional and therefore as nonwaivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.801" offset="11528781">First, the time limit sent forth in Section 2107 directly implicates the concerns that underlie the special treatment of jurisdictional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.727" offset="11564412">It's a fundamental precept of our legal system that Federal courts should take special care to avoid adjudicating cases where Congress has not authorized them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.194" offset="11606313">Or to put it another way, our legal system has presupposed that the unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction is an error different in kind from the misapplication of law in cases that a court is authorized to adjudicate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.175" offset="11678202">We would... we would characterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.319" offset="11694815">That is, this Court has often said that it's the fundamental duty of this Court when doubt is... when doubt is apparent, to inquire into its own jurisdiction and that of the court from which the record comes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.038" offset="11745702">And that division presupposes that there are cases over which the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction, over which this Court would not have appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.554" offset="11787811">For example, situations sometimes arise, particularly in cases that are adjudicated by three-judge district courts, in which there is a dispute as to whether a particular district court order is directly appealable to this Court or should go instead to the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.775" offset="11844654">And if somebody comes to this Court and this Court determines that the appeal should have gone to the court of appeals instead, the error is characterized as one of appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.430" offset="11883315">This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the ruling even though there's nothing to suggest that the case as a whole fell outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.329" offset="12746819">I think the courts of appeals have not required that they be written on the record but have required that there be a basis appearing in the record for those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.416" offset="12779211">So, for instance, if Petitioner's counsel had filed a document asking to reopen in the time, but had not represented that he had not been informed of the judgment, then I think that if the court had granted the reopening, that could be set aside on appeal on the ground that there was no support in the record for such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.147" offset="12846188">But I don't believe the courts of appeals have required there be explicit findings as opposed to findings that are implicit in the grant of the reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.232" offset="12878476">The point I was going to make about the certiorari petitions is that this Court's Rule 13.1 imposes a 90-day limit for filing a cert petition in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.678" offset="12916301">It is not divided between civil and criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.009" offset="12925601">But this Court has recognized that the 90-day limit has a very different status is criminal cases than in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.454" offset="12951410">That is Rule 13.2 of the rules of this Court states that when a cert petition is jurisdictionally out of time, the clerk is directed not to file it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.580" offset="12987877">And Rule 13.2 cites 28 U.S.C. 21.01(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.196" offset="13010342">So the clear implication is that the Court recognizes the time limit imposed by statute in civil cases to be a jurisdictional limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.170" offset="13042211">And the crucial point of Rule 13.2 is not simply that it uses the word jurisdictionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.044" offset="13065722">It's that it gives an instruction to the clerk not to file the petition regardless of whether any other party objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.167" offset="13094247">It's the very type of thing that a court will do as to matters of its jurisdiction, as to matters over which it has an obligation to take cognizance, regardless of the other party's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.006" offset="13137611">In criminal cases by contrast the 90-day rule applies under the rules, but the Court has recognized that it retains the authority to grant petitions that are untimely filed even in cases where the other party objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.235" offset="13194453">The other thing I would say about 2107(a) and it's... part of it is reprinted at page 16 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.884" offset="13237085">In the last full paragraph of page 16, it says, the basic time limit for appeals in civil cases is set by 28 U.S.C. 2107(a), which states that... and then the part we haven't reproduced says except as otherwise provided in this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.562" offset="13299779">And then it goes on to say no appeal shall bring any judgment order or decree in an action, suit or proceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals for review unless notice of appeal is filed within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.241" offset="13350561">And the significance of this provision, this language, is it doesn't simply say a notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.325" offset="13382848">Language like that would conceivably leave open the question of what happens if the notice of appeal is untimely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.011" offset="13409597">This language actually says if a notice of appeal is not filed within 30 days, the appeal will not bring the judgment--</text>

            <text syncTime="3377.323" offset="13662881">Well, are two things we would say about Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.374" offset="13671031">The first is that as this Court explained in its recent decision in Hibbs versus Winn, it's long been recognized that a timely motion for reconsideration will suspend the finality of the judgment and toll the time for taking an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.652" offset="13720141">And the Court in Hibbs versus Winn further explained that under certain circumstances, even an untimely motion for reconsideration will have that effect, if the judge appropriately considers it on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.179" offset="13766221">And Thompson can be explained as holding simply that where the Government does not object and the district court evinces an intent to treat the motion as timely and consider it on the merits, it will suspend the finality of the judgment I don't think Thompson has to read... has to be read to stand for a broader equitable principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.092" offset="13833931">The other thing I'd say about Thompson is that for better or for worse, the Government's brief in opposition in Thompson, and the case was decided on the cert papers, didn't cite 28 U.S.C. 2107; it relied exclusively on the time limit that was stated in the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.241" offset="13894535">Therefore the Court in Thompson was not required to grapple with congressionally imposed limits.</text>
