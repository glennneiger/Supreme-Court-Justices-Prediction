            <text syncTime="7.146" offset="182868">Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.417" offset="191958">The Clean Air Act requires that the owner of a major emitting facility obtain a prevention of significant deterioration permit before engaging in a modification, which is defined to include any physical change that increases the amount of any pollutant emitted by such source.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.101" offset="270744">Since 1980, EPA's PSD regulations have measured such increases in terms of actual emissions in tons per year.</text>

            <text syncTime="38.745" offset="309300">That's a disputed point, I gather, central to the case, whether or not the regulations measured PSD emissions through that device rather than the hourly emissions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sean H. Donahue</label>
            <text syncTime="51.675" offset="361023">That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but the text of the regulations refers pervasively, and I'm referring to the definition of major modification which is in 40 CFR 51.166(b)(2) and subsequent paragraphs of that regulation, refers pervasively to actual emissions and measures emissions exclusively in tons per year.</text>

            <text syncTime="79.973" offset="474185">It is a little of an exaggeration, though, to say that EPA has since the issuance of the regulations always interpreted them the way that you prefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.172" offset="519011">In fact, the director of the PSD program gave two opinions in which he took precisely the interpretation that opposing counsel took.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.545" offset="608455">I mean, it was the earliest, application of the regulation by the officer of the agency specifically in charge of the program.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.893" offset="649833">Well, Justice Scalia, as we point out in our brief, Director Reich does not adopt Duke's theory, in fact contradicts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.569" offset="684523">He doesn't say that a new source performance standard modification must precede a PSD major modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.973" offset="714198">Instead, in both he relies on the express exclusion in the PSD regulations for increases in hours of operation and the production rate, and as EPA explained in its contemporaneous preamble, that provision by its terms is an exception from the definition of physical change.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.766" offset="797372">It is not a provision that says... increase is attributable to a physical change, to increased hours that are enabled by physical change, are not considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.672" offset="840944">The plain language of the regulation actually contradicts this reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.685" offset="853065">These determinations themselves are quite ambiguous, and of course they are two of dozens of such determinations.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.542" offset="884412">Well, whatever the reason he gave, was it... these opinions were out there when the challenge to the regulations, in which Duke did not participate, when that challenge was brought, were these... were those opinions already out there?</text>

            <label>Mr. Sean H. Donahue</label>
            <text syncTime="201.522" offset="960376">Those opinions were out there but the plain language of the regulation and the preamble which explain that the increased hours exclusion was simply to allow companies to respond to demand and to link the coverage of PSD to construction activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.473" offset="1020144">What we have here is a physical change in the plants, massive renovations of these elaborate networks of pipes and tubes that compose a central component.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.163" offset="1074897">I understand that, and I think you may have the better of the argument on me on the interpretation of the PSD regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.356" offset="1103736">But what I am concerned about is that companies can get whipsawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.149" offset="1126933">They don't challenge the regulations when they come out because as far as they know, the agency is interpreting them in a way that they favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.206" offset="1163086">And then some years later, when it turns out the agency is using a different interpretation, you have the jurisdictional bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.391" offset="1195896">Well, Justice Scalia, these regulations were challenged early on and there was a... as the Court is aware, there was a settlement agreement in 1982 to which Duke was, in fact, a party, that proposed to add the hourly rate test that is completely absent from these regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.229" offset="1299237">They did in fact precisely that, Justice Kennedy, and that was resolved in the New York proceeding by the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.573" offset="1328598">Duke didn't challenge the very prominent aspect of the 1980 regulations, which was to move away from the potential emissions test of prior--</text>

            <text syncTime="335.871" offset="1497767">As Judge Posner in the Cinergy opinion this summer said, the argument that the statute mandates an hourly rate test is a challenge to the validity of these 1980 regulations because they don't say it, they don't provide for it, and they are very specific and detailed, and instead turn on actual annual emissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.872" offset="1573731">And the entire rationale EPA offered was linked to that effort to capture real world changes in emissions.</text>

NSPS definition?</text>

            <text syncTime="804.090" offset="3370642">He made that perfectly clear and it has always been clear that that is, in fact, the EPA's official position beginning with the 1980 preamble.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.977" offset="3718175">They raised the very incorporation theory that they advance here, that is the statutory argument that Congress was required to follow for the PSD regulations the same regulatory approach that the NSPS regulations had followed in 1977 with the hourly maximum achievable test.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.218" offset="3791214">They made that very argument in their brief in the D.C. Circuit in 2004, the D.C. Circuit addressed and rejected that argument on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.672" offset="5981006">On page 26 of your brief, I think it's explained well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.374" offset="5995740">You set out the regs and the reg says that a major modification is</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.478" offset="6012249">"any physical change in the method of operation that would lead to a significant net emissions increase. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.351" offset="6035655">Then you have little (iii), which is an exception, and it excepts a physical change which leads to... is just an increase in the hours of operation or the production rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.930" offset="6093960">Now, the question is what's in it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.132" offset="6102842">If that's out of it, what's in it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.585" offset="6112664">I think what they've said is, if you think about that, we'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical change that does nothing to increase the capacity, but just means you can run it more hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.312" offset="6155504">And they say their proof of that is that that was the EPA's interpretation for years and years and years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.006" offset="6182358">Indeed, we did what we did thinking that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.418" offset="6191971">And then after we did what we did, they pulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't it; now it means any physical change, like you change a nut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased capacity to emit more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.428" offset="6256024">It's just you run it more hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.909" offset="6261875">Now, that they say is basically unfair, it's not what this reg has been about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.463" offset="6288102">And they made that argument, according to them, very strongly and the Fourth Circuit took the argument and changed it all around and made some propositions of law that it's hard for even them to defend.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.061" offset="6334495">Now, that's what I think, that's what I think is lying... maybe that's lying at the heart of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.646" offset="6368873">There are several things, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.237" offset="6375246">First of all the language of the regulation simply does not support that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.582" offset="6396667">What the regulation says is that hours of... a change in hours of operation is not a physical change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.596" offset="6420700">Fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.965" offset="6426133">But we have a physical change here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.725" offset="6433238">It is undisputed that Duke made physical changes to its facilities, major modifications, sort of using that term in the non-regulatory sense, but substantial replacements of physical equipment at the facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.475" offset="6484229">So physical change has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.797" offset="6489454">The hours of operation exclusion, therefore, has no longer any relevance because it applies only at the physical change step of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.121" offset="6522786">There has been a physical change here regardless of whether hours of operation changed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.604" offset="6540758">Therefore, the hours of operation exclusion no longer applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.585" offset="6552670">The next question is whether the... if the physical change that did occur resulted in a significant net emissions increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.480" offset="6580255">Here it did under the plain language of the regulations and under the test that EPA applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.183" offset="6599064">It is true that 1981 they were arguably mistaken to the extent one can discern what the, Mr. Reich was actually saying, they seem to be simply a mistake in interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.151" offset="6646920">But in 1988, the administrator of the agency, the head of the agency, made very clear EPA's position, the very same position it is taking here today on the hours of operation exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.339" offset="6687671">The First Circuit in the Puerto Rican Cement case, as Your Honor knows, upheld that interpretation in 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.212" offset="6711181">The Seventh Circuit in footnote 11 in the WEPCO decision upheld that determination in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.304" offset="6731557">It was restated by the EPA again and again and it is well established.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.590" offset="6824657">Because it seems to me it is very clear that the understanding of everyone in the industry, outside the industry, from 1980, candidly well beyond 1988 all the way up until 1999, was that these regulations didn't apply under any circumstances in the absence of an increase in the capacity.</text>
