            <label>Mr. Robert C. Owen</label>
            <text syncTime="12.292" offset="194608">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.338" offset="206834">When this Court granted review in mid October in these consolidated cases, the cases exemplified the Fifth Circuit's settled approach to reviewing claims of error under this Court's 1989 decision in Penry v. Lynaugh.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.706" offset="264303">In both cases the court below failed to take seriously the requirement that capital jurors have a meaningful basis for giving effect to the relevant mitigating qualities of a defendant's evidence, and in both cases the court below found as a factual matter, both against common sense and this Court's holdings, that reasonable jurors would regard evidence that a defendant had experienced significant mistreatment or abuse as a child or had mental impairments as an adult as reasons to find him less dangerous rather than more dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.883" offset="388959">But those opinions, however incorrect, no longer represent the Fifth Circuit's view of Penry.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.786" offset="412574">In mid December the Fifth Circuit decided in its en banc decision in Nelson vs. Quarterman to take a sharp turn away from its prior treatment of Penry claims and to follow instead this Court's guidance in Tennard and Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.046" offset="469625">Under such circumstances, where the assumption that we imagine underlay this Court's decision to grant review in this case has been so profoundly changed by an intervening decision of the court below, we respectfully suggested by motion that the Court return these cases, vacate the judgments, return them to the Fifth Circuit for further consideration in light of the new opinion in Nelson.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="103.474" offset="559382">Why, when we are told that, that the State will surely challenge Nelson in this Court, and we already have the issue before us, so all that you would achieve is delay, just substituting the Nelson case for this one?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_c_owen" startTime="121.310" stopTime="171.650">
            <label>Mr. Robert C. Owen</label>
            <text syncTime="121.310" offset="630644">I don't believe, Your Honor, that, that all that would be accomplished by that would be certainly not just delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.949" offset="657289">I think that if the Court chooses to wait for the State's cert petition in Nelson, the Court could certainly put our cases aside and hold them awaiting Nelson... Nelson's cert petition should be filed by mid March... and then could make its judgment about whether to grant cert in Nelson or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.834" offset="716744">If it granted cert in Nelson it could decide the three cases together; if it found Nelson raised no questions that were worthy of review, it could either proceed to decide these cases or send them back to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.047" offset="761674">I think that the State's decision, though, Your Honor, is based on a, a misreading of Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.982" offset="785394">I think that the State has suggested to the Court that Nelson is in the State's phrase a narrow fact-based decision and I think that's not, I think that's not a fair characterization of the Nelson--</text>

            <text syncTime="171.650" offset="831996">Well, why can't we just read Nelson and then say in these cases whether or not it's correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="175.992" offset="849446">--I think the main reason, Your Honor, is that these cases aren't Nelson, and that Nelson if it presents issues that are worthy of the Court's consideration, that would be the better vehicle, rather than trying to use in effect these cases to decide issues that are presented by a different set of facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.857" offset="940874">Well, Your Honor, I am, I am confident that if the Court chooses to proceed on the merits of this case that we will prevail on the merits, until it finds--</text>

            <text syncTime="209.213" offset="982252">--Then let me turn, let me turn to our, our merits, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.322" offset="990716">The issue before the Court in this case as we said is whether the jury instructions gave the jurors a meaningful basis for considering the relevant mitigating qualities of these two Defendants' mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.424" offset="1047140">In Mr. Brewer's case that included the fact that he was hospitalized for treatment for a major episode of depression about three months before the murder, and the fact that the evidence indicated he had suffered serious abuse, serious physical and emotional abuse from his father as a teenager.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.495" offset="1115477">In Mr. Cole's case the evidence indicated that as a result of neglect and deprivation that he suffered as a child, he had himself emotional problems, fragmented personality, chronic depression, enormous need for nurturance, a lot of emotional turmoil and problems that continued into adulthood.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.019" offset="1193531">And in addition to that, the expert who testified at Mr. Cole's trial indicated that he had been given a set of generally accepted neuropsychological tests and that on those tests he had scored below normal and on some of them very far below normal, under the fifth percentile.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.621" offset="1259882">And as a result that he probably suffers from some sort of central nervous dysfunction which limits his impulse control.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.290" offset="1286631">We respectfully suggest that under this Court's decision in Penry, those are all the kinds of facts about these two Defendants that could reasonably support a juror in concluding that a life sentence rather than the death penalty was an appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.550" offset="1343682">But because the jurors were never asked whether the mitigating evidence reduced the Defendant's culpability in such a way as to call for a life sentence, the resulting death sentences are unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.780" offset="1392584">The jurors are asked only two questions as the Court well knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.841" offset="1408780">But just to review, under the pre-1991 Texas statute jurors were only asked two questions: Was the crime committed deliberately and is the Defendant likely to pose a continuing threat to society?</text>
            <text syncTime="327.087" offset="1453815">And those instructions alone as has been mentioned earlier this morning, don't mention mitigating evidence; the verdict form doesn't mention mitigating evidence; and so this Court has held repeatedly that whether that two question format satisfies the Eighth Amendment's individualized sentencing requirement is a matter of the evidence that's presented in a particular case, how it's argued to the jury, and what are the jurors told about the meaning of their instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.341" offset="1554856">And we believe that in this case, throughout the trial... in both of these cases, excuse me... throughout the trials the jurors were emphatically told that they were not entitled in deciding the future dangers test question to engage in any sort of broad inquiry into these Defendants' moral culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.709" offset="1628313">Instead, the prosecutors in both cases made very clear to the jurors during jury selection that in answering the future dangerousness question you must put to one side your opinion about whether the Defendant's background, for example, calls for a particular sentence and answer the question solely on, as the prosecutor put it, the basis of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.528" offset="1707516">And we feel that the evidence in this case very strongly would have supported the inference that these, both of these Defendants were likely to be dangerous--</text>

            <text syncTime="413.036" offset="1797586">I think that in, in the juror's mind, the only conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence in these cases is that the Defendants are likely to be dangerous in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.906" offset="1841054">That is exactly the same conclusion that would have been compelled by the evidence in Penry.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.224" offset="2250340">Tennard was itself both a habeas case and a case governed by the antiterrorism act, like these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.002" offset="2277403">And so in Tennard the Court was called on to decide not squarely the question of whether the State court decision in that case had been objectively unreasonable, but whether a reasonable jurist could have found it to be objectively unreasonable such that a certificate of appealability was warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.700" offset="2340202">Mr. Tennard's case was decided by the State court in 1997, so I think it is immanent in this Court's ruling in Tennard that at least as of 1997, it was apparent that a, a low IQ score alone implicated the concerns of Penry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.033" offset="7097622">--Mr. Marshall, I heard what you read from this charge, and I don't have the exact words of what the Court was talking about in Penry, but it did say a special instruction that would enable the jury who believed Penry committed the crime deliberately, that he committed it deliberately, not slowly, whatever you just read, but also believed that his background and diminished mental capacity diminished his moral culpability, making the imposition of the death sentence unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.845" offset="7252789">So what Penry said very clearly is yes, it's deliberate, but you give them a charge that tells them even though it was deliberate, because of his abuse, because of his retardation, he is not morally culpable to the same extent as someone who doesn't have those impairments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.400" offset="7339098">That's the instruction that Penry said could be given and that would be okay under the deliberateness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.406" offset="7431049">And then counsel argues to the jury that Brewer is uncapable of engaging in that sort of premeditation because of his mental problems, and so that's what reduces his culpability under the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1881.818" offset="7672734">However, future dangerousness also provides that vehicle in this case, just the same as it did in Graham, and so... and in Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.785" offset="7696558">The Court said that this kind of evidence, the evidence of a troubled childhood, could find effect within future dangerousness in some manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.390" offset="7735010">And granted we can conceive of other ways it might be relevant to culpability, but the Court explained... and this was what the State court was working with at the time it considered this claim... this Court explained that just because we can imagine other ways in which it might be relevant doesn't mean that we have got Eighth Amendment error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.149" offset="7802092">It's just important that the jury had some way of getting to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.554" offset="7815676">And I don't see how this is markedly different than the evidence that the Court said fit within future dangerousness in Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.394" offset="7847023">Now, in... I think another thing that I need to mention about Cole is, is that my colleague noted the expert testimony that Cole lacked impulse control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.264" offset="7898536">Now, I think the, the mitigating nature of that testimony in this case becomes especially apparent when you realize that, that Cole planned this crime 2 days in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.650" offset="7944094">He planned to strangle this 66-year-old blind man 2 days before he did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.602" offset="7959872">And so I don't think that an impulse control problem mitigates his culpability for this crime in any way and I don't think any reasonable juror would ever see that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.457" offset="7999265">So I think that the mitigating significance of that evidence in this case is severely diminished as opposed to the testimony that the jury heard in Penry, for example, which is that he'll never learn from his mistakes, he had previously committed a rape, he didn't learn from it; this time he committed a murder and a rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.106" offset="8065825">And so the mitigating relevance of that evidence was only aggravating within future dangerousness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.653" offset="8220051">And so evidence of intoxication, for example, while it does mitigate culpability in some manner, would not create the reasonable possibility of Eighth Amendment error in that sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.663" offset="10768140">I'd like to make two points about Graham since it's been a subject of some discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.628" offset="10800009">First is to remind the Court that Graham was a Teague case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.955" offset="10817250">Graham was a case about whether the law in 1984, prior to Penry... Mr. Graham's case became final on direct appeal... dictated the result that he was asking for, which I think doesn't mean it has no persuasive impact on these cases, but I certainly think it limits its precedential value outside the scope of the question of youth that Johnson later settled squarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.710" offset="10912336">The second thing I want to say about Graham is this is the State's brief in Graham, 91-7580, and I want to just note that at page 26, squarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.972" offset="10953296">This is the State's brief in Graham 917580 and I want to note at page 26, footnote 8 the State says the insubstantiality of Graham's evidence of a troubled childhood is readily apparent, which certainly suggests that there is a fair reading of the evidence in Graham of this background evidence as not being substantial, not being evidence about abuse or mistreatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.355" offset="11018915">The fact that he was moved from one relative to another because of the circumstances in his family, in that case was not shown to have any negative impact on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.039" offset="11061651">Whereas I think in Mr. Cole's case certainly there is expert testimony that it had a very devastating negative impact on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.162" offset="11090073">So Graham really does not even give the Court much guidance on the question of troubled background because there is no indication that Graham actually had a, a background of mistreatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.439" offset="11127167">By the same token with respect to the State's comment or my brother's comment that the, the record doesn't bear out that Mr. Brewer was struck by his father with a stick of firewood, that is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.769" offset="11412528">It's not just the difference between being hit and watching someone else being hit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.749" offset="11456414">But the argument is that the jury hearing this evidence in light of all the instructions will only conclude that the evidence shows that he will be violent again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.548" offset="11739686">And I do think that the, that the fact of Mr. Brewer's... the fact that the jury knew that he had endured this mistreatment as a teenager could only have been given aggravating effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.748" offset="11784407">I don't think there is any way to reason from the premise that he was mistreated physically and emotionally by his father when he was a teenager, to the conclusion that therefore he will be less dangerous in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.648" offset="11824009">That doesn't seem to me to be a reasonable connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.367" offset="11834876">And I think that what the Court was calling for in Johnson was that there be some sensible link between the proffered mitigating evidence and these narrow questions, which as has been pointed out already were the only options for the jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.347" offset="11886807">There was no, there was no mercy option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.158" offset="11898092">There was no mitigation instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.220" offset="11902376">The jury was told solely these two... these two special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.703" offset="11916274">With respect to the Brewer argument that there was a deliberateness instruction, I think Justice Ginsburg has it exactly right in observing that in Penry, what the Court said was that to satisfy the, you know, to fix the deficit in the former Texas special issues, a definition of deliberateness would have to direct the jury's attention to the defendant's personal culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.490" offset="12003418">And I don't think this instruction does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.474" offset="12011359">This instruction directs them to the sort of quantity of forethought, how much did he think about it, how long did he think about it, did he mull it over?</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.518" offset="12039467">But I don't think that that captures the moral culpability aspect that Penry says is required under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.250" offset="12066425">If the Court has further questions I'm happy to entertain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.452" offset="12079278">Otherwise we would ask that the Court grant our motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.342" offset="12090771">In the alternative we would ask that the Court reverse the judgments in both cases with directions to reinstate the District Court's favorable judgment in Mr. Brewer's case and to grant habeas relief in Mr. Cole's case.</text>
