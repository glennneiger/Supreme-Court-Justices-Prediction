            <label>Ms. Jean M. Manning</label>
            <text syncTime="9.116" offset="193072">Justice Stevens and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.800" offset="203835">If I may, I would like to quickly frame the merits of the case and then turn to the jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.723" offset="223583">In United States vs. Gravel this Court recognized that members of Congress have to delegate some of their legislative authority to employees and these employees are a second self to the member.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.680" offset="275410">They are performing some of the legislative duties the member himself would otherwise perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.974" offset="296517">Therefore, they are an integral part of the legislative process of the member's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.089" offset="320968">For that reason, the member must have absolute trust and confidence that these employees are in fact performing as his second self, and to do that the member has to have complete discretion in selecting who these employees are and in managing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.108" offset="385125">If a court oversees a member's selection of these employees and his management of these employees, then the court and not the member is managing part of his legislative process and that is a violation of the Speech or Debate Clause because the purpose of the clause is to ensure that the legislative process will be performed independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.273" offset="469761">Now--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="78.833" offset="471956">Do you think... do you think that we owe any special measure of respect to the Congress, that is most intimately concerned with the Speech or Debate Clause, with their view that this is, this legislation is compatible with that clause?</text>

            <text syncTime="99.537" offset="554816">This Court has never deferred to Congress with respect to its interpretation and in fact has disagreed with Congress, for example, in the Gravel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.300" offset="585850">But the other reason is that the Congress of course is a political body and because of that it will make decisions that are politically expedient at times, which means that over time their decisions can change, while the Court is uniquely designed and intended to decide cases on something other than what is politically expedient.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.975" offset="672576">This is especially important when we are dealing with the Constitution and interpreting the Constitution.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="134.149" offset="693265">But what we are involved with in this case is Congress subjecting itself to the laws that govern all other employers.</text>

          <turn speaker="jean_m_manning" startTime="143.415" stopTime="164.359">
            <label>Ms. Jean M. Manning</label>
            <text syncTime="143.415" offset="730359">It did, Justice Ginsburg, subject itself, but it also in Section 413 recognized that there may be Speech or Debate Clause issues and maybe not all of these cases can be adjudicated in a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.362" offset="778111">Not that they can't be adjudicated, but maybe not in a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.904" offset="788246">So while subjecting itself to the law and doing the best it could to do that, it also cannot trump the Constitution.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="172.474" offset="846552">I mean, the Constitution... I mean, the statute has within itself a Speech or Debate Clause exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.377" offset="870166">Now, I guess you can argue that a lower court might not accurately provide the Speech or Debate Clause protection that is due, but that, that doesn't meet, it seems to me, the, the jurisdictional requirement that, that the constitutionality of the statute be called into question.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.674" offset="975388">Rather, it's an as-applied argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.487" offset="982597">What we are arguing is that the issue that was before the circuit court was whether the application of Section 408 to this particular case... and of course 408 is what gives the Court jurisdiction... whether applying that to this case violates the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.107" offset="1041112">Well, that doesn't comply with Section 412, which says that an appeal may be taken directly to the Supreme Court from</text>

            <text syncTime="260.680" offset="1199414">We have no way of knowing exactly why the court ruled the way it did, and for that reason the appeal, the review, was that the original appeal was taken properly to the court of appeals, so that we are here not on appellate jurisdiction, but cert jurisdiction, if at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.628" offset="7319172">The motion to dismiss in this case raised a single issue, the issue of absolute immunity; more specifically, whether the employing office created by Congress as the defendant in these kinds of cases can be sued by a member of a Senator or a House of Representatives staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.312" offset="7393882">The Dayton office argues that a Senator's personnel decisions are always a legislative act that are always absolutely immunized by the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.750" offset="7443619">That argument is untenable and it was rejected by every one of the eight judges of the D.C. Circuit en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.315" offset="7477892">This case doesn't involve any legislative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.748" offset="7491685">Mr. Hanson didn't work on Capitol Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.870" offset="7504119">He was in the Minnesota office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.003" offset="7512687">His, the nature of his claim is that he was a valued employee until he became ill and disclosed his illness and need for surgery, at which point he was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.748" offset="7551662">Senator Dayton's office first says that they were not even aware, that Senator Dayton was unaware of the need for surgery at the time he made the decision to fire Mr. Hanson, and then says that the reason for the firing was Mr. Hanson's work on a classic constituent service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.339" offset="7618013">This case presents exactly the hypothetical that Justice Breyer was asking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.254" offset="7641628">Although Mr. Hanson had a very small, he says 5 percent of his duties, that were in some way related to the legislative process, no one contends, not Mr. Kimball, not Senator Dayton's office, that that had anything to do with the reason for his firing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.114" offset="7709128">In fact, the only evidence in the record, in this record so far, is that on that small amount of work that Mr. Hanson did with respect to ambulance legislation, he did a, quote unquote, "great job".</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.692" offset="7815394">The reason is that this Court has said that conduct that is related to the legislative process, that may in fact be important to the legislative process, is not itself a part of the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.911" offset="7868266">That is the fundamental holding of Brewster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.102" offset="7885089">And this Court has found that some actions that affect an employee, for example in the Bogan case, where a decision that resulted in the termination of a person was clearly legislative in nature because it was made in a legislative proceeding, it was voted upon by the legislators, and it was based upon either budgetary or policy determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.339" offset="7982055">That is a legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.272" offset="7989788">But this Court in Bogan specifically distinguished that circumstance from a classic personnel action firing such as happened to Mr. Hanson here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.019" offset="8028762">There was no legislative act involved in Mr. Hanson's firing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.259" offset="8041719">He was just fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.611" offset="8047152">The reason for the firing is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.123" offset="8061154">A jury can sort out issues like whether or not Senator Dayton had notice of the need for surgery, whether or not Mr. Hanson's performance of classic constituent services was bad or good, as we contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.680" offset="8111414">But none of that involves legislative activity as this Court has described it under the speech or debate act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.186" offset="8141402">So our contention is that the only issue in this case is absolute immunity and there is no absolute immunity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.735" offset="8183616">This case does not involve a legislative act, as Judge Randolph below and all of the judges below recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="2041.977" offset="8324573">The Congressional Accountability Act does incorporate the Speech or Debate Clause with respect to the evidentiary privilege and that is clear from Section 413.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.714" offset="8363548">In that instance, district courts will have to deal with the proffered evidence on a case-by-case basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2172.273" offset="8845768">I'm not sure I would see that his testifying about how he has allocated money in the office, for example, would be anything other than testimony about an administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.230" offset="8893624">If he were... for example, if a plaintiff certainly attempted to introduce evidence in a case about a speech that the Senator gave on the floor of the Senate in which he was accused of making maybe a bigoted or a sexist remark, Section 413 would clearly preclude that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.901" offset="8968230">And there may be circumstance, for example, where if a plaintiff wanted to introduce a draft of the speech or a draft of legislation, that a court, district court, could in those circumstances say that that intrudes so much on a true legislative act that the court could preclude that testimony from going in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2517.901" offset="10228272">The reasons behind the decision in the legislative context could be shielded by the evidentiary privilege, but we think there's a clear difference between the employees performing a duty that is related to the legislative process being different than a legislative act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.602" offset="10307058">It may be that in some rare circumstances the Senator in order to fully defend himself feels the need to actually testify about real legislative acts, such as votes on something or his conduct in a committee proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.552" offset="10366826">But his assessment of an employee's performance, just as Judge White's assessment in the Forrester case of Miss Forrester's performance, is not legislative activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.406" offset="12158303">One was two cases against offices of members or committees where an employee worked for a member.</text>

            <text syncTime="3031.074" offset="12280974">Because, as we said in our brief, the decision of the court of appeals was a decision on the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause as that clause is preserved in Section 413 of the act and therefore there would be no appeal under Section 412.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.864" offset="12340116">If the court does go to the merits in this matter, I think it's important to effectuate Congress' intent in enacting the statute along with its concerns with the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.383" offset="12390166">The Speech or Debate Clause provides senators and representatives with a constitutional privilege that is critical to securing the independence of the legislative branch in our system of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.540" offset="12434783">Certainly, Congress is the institution that has the greatest interest in and is most sensitive to maintaining a robust speech or debate privilege under this Court's precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.746" offset="12471668">In enacting the Congressional Accountability Act, however, Congress concluded that it could provide its own employees with the same employment law protections that it had already provided Executive Branch employees and private sector employees, including the critical right of action for victims of illegal discrimination to bring suit in the Federal court; and that a suit under the Act would not infringe upon the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.414" offset="12582323">Congress relied on this Court's own precedent in making that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.067" offset="12600922">Under the Speech or Debate Clause, this Court has made clear that the clause is robust, protects activities outside of just speech and debate on the floor of either House, but that it shouldn't be extended beyond what is necessary to preserve the independence of the legislative process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3384.462" offset="13694512">And when Congress did provide these rights under the statute, it was very important for the Congress under the previous regime affecting the Senate, employees had employment protections and they had administrative processes that they could go to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.820" offset="13747907">But they lacked a judicial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.710" offset="13755534">And Congress made a specific decision that providing that right of action was an important employment law protection employees needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.027" offset="13792733">And again it relied on this Court's decisions both under the Speech or Debate Clause as to the scope of the clause and under Forrester where this Court held that a judge's employment decision as to an employee who did judicial duties was not a judicial act, did... achieve absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.839" offset="13860024">It was a... it was an administrative act, an employment act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.461" offset="13870473">And similarly here what is brought before the courts is an employment act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.398" offset="13918225">There is just a question presented does the Speech or Debate Clause bar the jurisdiction of Federal courts when a legislative, an employee with any legislative duties brings a suit under the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.806" offset="13963887">And I think the question, the answer to that question has to be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.908" offset="13976321">Indeed in the case here, you could have litigation over whether the Senator knew of the alleged disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.490" offset="13998578">That's one of the disputes that's been laid out in the pleadings, whether that was the basis for the, for the decision to terminate the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.744" offset="14027626">These are all the types of issues that play out in district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.467" offset="14042568">District courts receive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.448" offset="14050405">They make these judgments; they see the specific context and they make specific rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.602" offset="14067019">To try to decide in the abstract how you would apply an employment law case with the Speech or Debate Clause in an evidentiary sense is very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.258" offset="14101709">And that's why a more full record would be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.350" offset="14114039">But to decide the question on appeal, I think the Court can easily decide if these cases go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.913" offset="14136295">One last point I would like to make is to address the issue of the existence of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.266" offset="14157716">It's not a mere creation of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.120" offset="14177151">Those offices incur liabilities or obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.052" offset="14188854">They buy paper; they make contracts and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.784" offset="14199825">When a Senator leaves office, the employing office still has to pay the bills that were incurred when the Senator was in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.878" offset="14228142">And the Senate allows employing offices under the approval of the former member to submit the vouchers and receive payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.422" offset="14254369">The employing office has life afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.093" offset="14265027">Similarly here, if it incurs an employment liability it has life sufficient to litigate whether or not that liability exists and a judgment will be paid under Government funds under the Act.</text>
