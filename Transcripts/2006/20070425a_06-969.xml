            <text syncTime="14.024" offset="212935">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.366" offset="226309">In McConnell against FEC this Court upheld Title II's restrictions on electioneering communications by unions and corporations against facial attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.035" offset="264970">In doing so, this Court reviewed a voluminous record and concluded that the vast majority of the ads that had been run in previous cycles and came within the statutory definition could constitutionally be regulated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.029" offset="324948">Accordingly, this Court rejected the overbreadth challenge and upheld the statute on it face.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.419" offset="346577">To be sure, the last time this case was before the Court the Court made clear that nothing in McConnell foreclosed an opportunity for as-applied challenges to the statute and the Court remanded the case for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.958" offset="400703">But to be consistent with McConnell's overbreadth decision, any as-applied challenge cannot have the effect of calling into question a substantial percentage of the statute's applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.765" offset="447932">Yet the district court's decision below has precisely that forbidden effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.374" offset="466322">There is nothing atypical about the three ads that are before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.574" offset="483145">Indeed, they closely resemble the Jane Doe hypothetical ads that this Court identified at page 127 as the prototype of ads that, although they took the form of issue ads, nonetheless were functionally equivalent to express advocacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.050" offset="557124">Well, Justice Scalia, I don't think you were wrong, and I suppose that obviously you thought the rest of the Court was wrong in McConnell, and if the Court wants to reconsider that decision... I mean, that's an option the Court can take in the appropriate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.640" offset="619400">I would suggest that this is not the appropriate case for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I think it was briefed in this case really as something of an afterthought, not as a principal focus of the briefing.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.167" offset="665584">In the McConnell case this Court, as you well remember, had an unbelievably exhaustive record before it in making a judgment about the facial constitutionality of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.064" offset="1365144">Is 70 percent a vast majority, so that 30 percent of the ads are going to be outside of that and would be candidates for this as-applied challenge?</text>

            <text syncTime="320.540" offset="1439018">Equally importantly, on page 207 of the opinion, when it was specifically addressing overbreadth, it made the argument, it made the conclusion, that both in absolute and relative terms this statute was not substantially overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.145" offset="1493457">And it seems to me then at a minimum for any as-applied challenge to be consistent with that overbreadth determination, it can't have the effect of opening up the statute wide open such that on a going forward basis the majority, certainly a substantial number, percentage, inconsistent with an overbreadth holding, of the ads that would be run by unions and corporations within the last 60 days of the election would qualify for the exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="776.043" offset="3261006">And what's interesting about that to me is if you look at joint appendix 45 and 46 for the examples they were able to do it in terms of tag line, "Earth, call the Senate".</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.633" offset="4495449">I'd like to... I'd like to address three points that came up at the earlier part of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.617" offset="4515302">First of all, I'd like to, I think just with respect correct a premise of one of Justice Scalia's questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.960" offset="4544768">Then I would like to address the two questions that I think I heard the Chief Justice ask, which is how do we know that the this is an atypical ad, and what would the standard... what standard would a court apply in adjudicating as-applied challenges?</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.576" offset="4599207">And then finally, assuming there's time permitting I'd like to address the question of why we shouldn't revisit McConnell which I think was posed both by the Chief Justice and by Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.698" offset="4643720">First, as to the premise, Justice Scalia, and it relates to what the predicate was of the now famous vast majority reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.133" offset="4677366">I'm quoting from... it's entirely clear from this Court's opinion and I believe it's on page 207 that the referent was issue ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.722" offset="4715713">In fact, what this Court said was the precise percentage of issue ads that clearly identified a candidate and were aired during those relatively brief pre-election time spans but had no electioneering purpose is a matter of dispute between the parties and among the judges on the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.418" offset="4794499">Nevertheless, the "vast majority" of ads clearly had such a purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.830" offset="7012190">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the Government's problem here is that they are repudiating the very studies and expert witness testimony that this Court relied upon in recognizing a distinction between sham issue ads and genuine issue ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.898" offset="7080422">That was a methodology that the Government created and this Court relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.959" offset="7104664">Now they are converting genuine issue ads which they identified in the record through their expert testimony and their studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.146" offset="7141444">These ads are contained in the joint appendix on pages 159 to 167.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.408" offset="7166521">Their expert based upon their studies testified that these were genuine issue ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.811" offset="7192121">Now they refused to state, as they do here, refused to state a test to determine what's a genuine ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.746" offset="7223886">So we are left trying to comply with this law and mount the as-applied challenges that this Court said is available to us to look at these ads and determine what essential features there are of these ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.990" offset="7276863">And as I will explain further later, these are grassroots lobbying ads of the type not like Jane Doe or yellow tail, but as... but exactly the type of the PBA ad, for instance, which we have focused on, which is on page 166 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.341" offset="7358260">So in these studies, and these experts, they only looked at the text of these ads to determine whether they were genuine or sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.273" offset="7397966">There was no testimony about the subjective intent of the speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.070" offset="7417192">There was no testimony about the particular groups who ran these ads on whether or not their PAC was supporting a particular candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.504" offset="7450943">No expert in McConnell speculated about the possible effect of any particular ad to determine whether it was genuine or sham.</text>
