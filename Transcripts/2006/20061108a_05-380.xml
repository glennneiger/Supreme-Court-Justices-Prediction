            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="9.789" offset="190698">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.724" offset="202506">Congress held six hearings over four different Congresses and heard from dozens of witnesses in determining that partial birth abortions are never medically necessary, pose health risks, and should be banned.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.715" offset="254437">Under familiar principles of deference to congressional fact finding, those determinations should be upheld as long as they represent reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence in the congressional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.023" offset="303652">That standard is amply satisfied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.058" offset="315772">The evidence before Congress was clear that partial birth abortions were never medically necessary, and that safe alternatives were always available such that no woman would be prevented from terminating her pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.801" offset="366763">As a result, Congress was entitled to make a judgment in furthering its legitimate interests that they were going to ban a particularly gruesome procedure that blurred the line between abortion and infanticide.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="66.208" offset="416396">General Clement, couldn't a similar record be made with respect to what is the more common procedure, the D&amp;E, that involves dismemberment of a fetus inside the womb.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.154" offset="484210">So assuming you're right that it is constitutional for Congress to ban the D&amp;X proceeding, wouldn't the same reasoning apply, couldn't Congress make similar findings with respect to what is the most common method for second trimester abortions?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="102.032" stopTime="144.025">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="102.032" offset="559652">I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that this Court's precedence, in particular the Danforth case, would stand as an obstacle to that piece of legislation, because in Danforth, this Court struck down an effort to ban what was then the majority method of inducing a second term abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.058" offset="623808">And I think in the same way, there is quite a different situation when Congress comes in and tries to deal with the primary abortion method in the second trimester.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.830" offset="658917">Here, though, Congress didn't go after the dog, so to speak, it went after the tail.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.865" offset="675008">This very aberrant procedure, atypical procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.884" offset="687129">And the numbers are hard to come by, but I don't think anybody suggests that the D&amp;X procedure is anything more than a very small minority of second trimester abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.240" offset="724537">And so I do think--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="144.025" stopTime="161.154">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="144.025" offset="727671">Even though we are told by some of the medical briefs that the procedure is basically the same, they start out in the same way and that the difference... the differences are not large in particular cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="161.154" stopTime="290.703">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="161.154" offset="796217">--Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me make a couple of points in response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.605" offset="810009">I think... taken at the broader level first, I think there is one very important difference between these two procedures that led Congress to ban one and allow the other to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.294" offset="848775">And that is whether fetal demise takes place in utero, which is, of course, the hallmark of all abortions, or whether fetal demise, the lethal act, takes place when the fetus is more than halfway out of the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.536" offset="893706">Now, as to their suggestion, I think most particularly by Respondents in the second case, that there really is no meaningful difference between those two procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.790" offset="926724">And with respect, I just don't think the record supports that.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.075" offset="939890">If you look at the record in this case, it's very clear in the district court opinion that you have some doctors, and examples would be Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Creinin, or one of the Nebraska Plaintiffs, Dr. Vibhakar.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.082" offset="983880">They go in, in each and every case, and try to perform a dismemberment, or D&amp;E, procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.436" offset="1005301">And because they're trying to perform the D&amp;E procedure, they need to dilate the cervix only modestly.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.423" offset="1029229">And so Dr. Creinin, for example, his testimony is he only dilates the cervix two centimeters or two and a half centimeters.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.077" offset="1055874">Now, in contrast, you have other doctors, and here the examples I would point to are two of the Plaintiff's experts, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson, they, in every single case, set out to perform the D&amp;X procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.921" offset="1111253">And that has material differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.956" offset="1119403">For example, the dilation regimen that they use.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.325" offset="1132883">And so Dr. Frederickson, for example, uses multiple sets of laminaria to dilate the cervix, and she gets a much greater degree of dilation, 5 to 6 centimeters of dilation.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.763" offset="1174574">And of course, not only do they set out to perform different procedures, but they, in fact, perform different procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.500" offset="1197562">So the evidence here again reflects that Dr. Vibhakar, for example, in 100 percent of the cases, ends up performing a dismemberment procedure, or a D&amp;E procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.808" offset="1238835">For Dr. Creinin, it's 99 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.427" offset="1249284">Now, by contrast, Dr. Chasen and--</text>
            <text syncTime="277.046" offset="1259733">Dr. Frederickson, when they set out to perform a D&amp;X procedure, they are successful in their objective less often.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.616" offset="1286065">There are different numbers for different doctors, but it seems that, at most, they can achieve their objective about a third of the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.690" offset="1338310">There are so many doctors here.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.652" offset="1410199">I think his deposition was taken, or his testimony was taken principally in the California case, but it was introduced in all three cases as part of the evidentiary record.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.575" offset="1441859">Dr. Vibhakar is one of the Plaintiffs in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.893" offset="1455129">And Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson would also... their testimony was in the record, I think, in all three cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.980" offset="1479475">Just from my going through this record, I compare it with Stenberg, with what's in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.969" offset="1515420">We have two cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.069" offset="1519808">And it's a fair conclusion that there are, in each case, before Congress and in here, there are some doctors who think this is safe and some doctors who think it isn't safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.625" offset="1558052">And if you look at the... sort of by counting, by numbers, I guess if you look by lines of testimony or by different doctors, interestingly enough, it seems to me there are more doctors in these two cases and in front of Congress who said it is not safe than there were when we considered the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.488" offset="1633493">And there are fewer doctors who say it is safe even with the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.106" offset="1648017">So I don't know if you're supposed to count doctors or what.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.392" offset="1657108">My question would be, if this... do we owe more deference to a congressional finding or to Congress than we owe to a state legislature?</text>
            <text syncTime="386.514" offset="1697650">What is... I mean, I take it a state legislature is democratically elected, and don't we owe similar deference to both?</text>

            <text syncTime="395.437" offset="1733281">Well, Justice Breyer, I think you certainly owe deference to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.972" offset="1747492">I think--</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="399.372" offset="1749059">Well, if we owe deference to both, and I would have thought that we did, then I think in the Nebraska case, despite the deference that was owed, the Court came to the conclusion that the statute of Nebraska was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception for the health of the mother, something that came from preceding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.575" offset="1857833">So if giving deference to Nebraska, we reach that conclusion there, and if the deference that is owed is the same, and if the evidence is about the same on both sides, how can we reach a different conclusion here?</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="443.600" stopTime="510.808">

            <text syncTime="443.600" offset="1925960">--Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, obviously I'm at a certain deficit to you in discussing what this Court held in the Stenberg opinion, which you wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.504" offset="1953546">But my reading of that opinion is that this Court did not focus on what was before the Nebraska legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.008" offset="1979563">But this Court focused on what the district court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.093" offset="1991893">And in particular, in the critical part of the opinion, which would be Section 2(A) of the opinion, as I read the opinion, what this Court did is it confronted Nebraska's argument that the D&amp;X procedure was not, in fact, safer.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.933" offset="2043302">And the first thing this Court did is said, well, that argument faces quite a burden, because the district court made a contrary finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.754" offset="2066603">And then this Court in 2(A)(1) of the opinion referenced that finding, and four different times cited the district court record, and then so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.879" offset="2103070">It then noted the various eight arguments were made by the state in its amici to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.681" offset="2118326">And as I read the opinion, it basically says the latter, the objections don't outweigh the former, the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.401" offset="2141209">Now, I think if you compare the record before the courts and before Congress, compare that to what was before the district court in Stenberg, I think there is a much more robust factual record here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.422" offset="6813261">And there is some tension between Stenberg and Turner on this, because Stenberg seems to suggest, well, when there is a doubt, the kind of doubt that would normally get you past a summary judgment, you defer to the doctors, and Turner seems to suggest when you have a doubt, conflicting evidence, the kind of doubt that might get you past summary judgment normally, you defer to Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.001" offset="6891524">It can't go both ways, can't go opposite ways, and we would say resolve that tension, but when there is congressional findings, something that you obviously didn't have to confront in Stenberg, defer to the congressional approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.292" offset="6932693">If Stenberg means something contrary, that even in the face of congressional findings that you have to defer to a minority opinion of doctors and, you know, kind of invert what would normally be the way of approaching it, we think then that would be inconsistent with this Court's decision in Casey, among others, and you should revisit Stenberg to that effect, to that extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3133.580" offset="12685901">So the numbers are not high of any complications, but the complications when they occur are, are devastating.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.208" offset="12760403">So... if I can move to the deference point, I would like to talk a little bit about deference to congressional findings because there is significant authority from this Court of course, saying that where there are danger signs of constitutional risks, as the Court recently said in Randall versus Sorrell, that the Court must independently and carefully review congressional findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.340" offset="12860922">And the Court has rejected findings that attempted to change either by findings of fact or legal findings, that attempted to change a constitutional standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3214.465" offset="13009402">The reasons are the findings that are not defended by the government, that were not defended by the government witnesses and that are blatantly false, except for perhaps one of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.126" offset="13176063">It says that abortion, partial birth abortion is a disfavored practice along abortion providers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.403" offset="13241160">We know now that is not true because the Chasen study has come out, and is the first study of its kind to try to evaluate the differences between intact and non intact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.282" offset="14364739">And under the Stenberg ruling, although the Court hasn't addressed that question directly, under Stenberg what the Court has said is, the Court can ban procedures only where there is not significant medical authority supporting their use as the safest procedure in some circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.493" offset="14441539">So perhaps I misunderstood your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.545" offset="14449794">But the Court has not ever addressed the question, can we ban a procedure that's not the safest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.134" offset="14488141">I think the ruling in Stenberg would say well, there has to be significant medical authority that in some circumstances it is the safest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.407" offset="14525235">The alternative argument would be, but, if it is the procedure that's used in 95 percent of the cases, or a vast majority of the cases, and banning it would thereby deny women the right to get an abortion and be a substantial obstacle in their path in obtaining a legal abortion, that would be the reason you couldn't ban it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3618.055" offset="14623769">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.190" offset="14640279">Let me make just a couple of points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.123" offset="14648011">I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's question about whether or not there are going to be alternative methods available to end the pregnancy as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.293" offset="14680716">The answer to that is there will always be an alternative available as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.197" offset="14700360">The alternative will always be the D&amp;E procedure, which the district court in this case called the gold standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.085" offset="14723870">And the best evidence of that, Justice Kennedy, is that their own witnesses like Dr. Chasen, for example, when they set out to perform the D&amp;X procedure, they are only successful about 33 percent of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.992" offset="14775488">What happens in the other 67 percent of the cases is they actually, even though they tried to perform a D&amp;X, will perform a D&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.581" offset="14801924">And so all of the clinics that provide D&amp;X also necessarily provide D&amp;E, because the D&amp;E is what they end up with if they are not able to remove the fetus intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.954" offset="14843407">So in every single case, there are some, you know, the induction procedure has to be done in a hospital, but the D&amp;X and D&amp;E procedures are both equally available in clinics, so no woman as either a theoretical matter or a practical matter, is going to be denied a safe alternative to end her pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.296" offset="14904742">I wanted to pick up on Justice Souter's question as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.581" offset="14913937">You asked for factual citations in the record on this dispute between us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.852" offset="14934940">I think the record is really overwhelmingly in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.837" offset="14946956">I point you to Dr. Fitzhugh, who's one of the plaintiffs on this side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.908" offset="14967227">135a, he says he doesn't try for intact delivery in every case because it would necessitate a second round of dilation, a second round of laminarias, so he doesn't do the second round, he gets dismemberment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.716" offset="15014457">Dr. Knorr, another one of the plaintiffs, at page 142a, he says the procedure would require greater dilation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.953" offset="15039430">And if I could just finish on the citations, Dr. Vibhakar, who does dismemberment 100 percent of the time, 148a... all of these are in the petition appendix of the district court opinion... Dr. Cranen explains his procedure at 174a to 177a.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.027" offset="15095645">Thank you.</text>
