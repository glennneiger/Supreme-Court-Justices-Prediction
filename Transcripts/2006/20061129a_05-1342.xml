            <text syncTime="2313.023" offset="9401739">--But, but this really became clear, in answer to your question, in part two of my answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.658" offset="9416263">In 1999 when Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, it directly addressed this question of affiliates of national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.914" offset="9453252">And this is on page 2A of our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.316" offset="9466941">It refers to, it created a new type of affiliate, for the first time, financial subsidiaries which can do anything financial in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.822" offset="9504975">So they can actually engage in activities that the parent national bank could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.293" offset="9522843">But if you look at the bottom of page 2A of our appendix, this is Section 24A now of the act, it said that financial subsidiaries can also engage in activities that are permitted for national banks to engage in directly, subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of the activities by a national bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.206" offset="9602464">And then at the bottom of 3A and going over to 4A where they actually define financial subsidiaries, they do so by distinguishing them from the operating subsidiaries which had existed for decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.762" offset="9648648">And at the top of 4A you see that the operating subsidiary again engages only in activities that the national banks may engage in directly and are conducted subject to the same terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.570" offset="9695878">Then if you'll bear with me a moment longer, on page 12A of our appendix some additional provisions of GLBA... actually, that's the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, GLBA people call it... said... this is on 12A... that securities activities and insurance activities, activities that have been traditionally subject to State regulation, if they're engaged in by a functionally regulated subsidiary, operating subsidiary or a financial subsidiary, then they may be regulated by relevant State securities authorities or State insurance authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.795" offset="9860867">So Congress was actually quite specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.247" offset="9870585">I mean, your question is about statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.181" offset="9882392">You don't find this in 484, which is, since it's a century old, doesn't really get into this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.018" offset="9909664">But in this 1999 statute, it's all about subsidiaries of national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.905" offset="9933279">Congress was pretty clear if it's securities, if it's insurance, it can be regulated by States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.226" offset="9954594">They were specific about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.143" offset="9962222">If it's a banking activity that the bank itself can undertake, it's subject to the same terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.765" offset="9992733">And so, going back to the Chief Justice's question, you have this question of would it be a preempted State preempted state law if it were applied to the national bank when the national bank is making a mortgage loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.822" offset="10044978">Not every State law is preempted because not every State law conflicts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2872.880" offset="11641164">Let me begin by addressing this question of whether what's going on here is conflict preemption or field preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.767" offset="11660704">Now, it depends on how one defines those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.569" offset="11675959">But as we understand it it's conflict preemption, not field preemption, in the following sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.873" offset="11693096">Our position is not that State laws have no application to operating subsidiaries or to national banks for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.443" offset="11719427">It's that State laws apply to the same extent to operating subsidiaries as they would to national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.681" offset="11740325">And as this court has made clear in the Atherton case and in the Barnett Bank case, State laws do apply to national banks and operating subsidiaries in a variety of respects, and State contract law would be an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.703" offset="11780449">But with operating subsidiaries in particular, State laws dealing with corporate governance questions, for example the process of incorporation, dissolution, shareholder voting, and things of that sort, would be controlling and so federal law doesn't control those sorts of aspects.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.998" offset="11849621">Yes, if the bank is sued the normal rules of contract are going to apply for enforcing a contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.770" offset="11888701">Well, I guess it depends on the degree to which the regulations apply to the national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.341" offset="11910957">That's my only point, is that State laws apply to the same extent to the operating subsidiary as to the national bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.518" offset="11971666">And Justice Scalia, this goes to your questions about the scope of these provisions at 12--</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.553" offset="11987861">U.S.C. 484(a) and 481.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.587" offset="11996012">It's true that those provisions say by their terms that visitorial authority resides exclusively with the Comptroller of the Currency with respect to national banks, and there's another provision that deals with affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.062" offset="12045853">And so that's the point with visitorial authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.681" offset="12056407">But visitorial authority by its very nature is asserted in service of and enforcement of some underlying substantive requirement, and the underlying substantive requirement at issue here is the requirement that operating subsidiaries register with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.572" offset="12107920">And so there's a question of conflict preemption that applies both to the national bank and the operating subsidiary of whether that underlying substantive registration requirement could be applied to the national bank or could be applied to the operating subsidiary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.325" offset="12858888">First of all, in one sense this is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary can't engage in federally authorized activities unless and until it gets the State's permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.665" offset="12892325">So at least there is a prohibition at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.450" offset="12903401">But more importantly, the Court's cases aren't limited to situations involving prohibitions of the sort that Your Honor posits, because in the Franklin National Bank case that was a situation in which the national bank had the power to accept savings deposits and the State law that was deemed to be preempted there didn't prohibit the national bank from accepting savings deposits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.098" offset="13090020">What it could do, though, is regulate the subsidiary's conduct of the business of banking, because, after all, an operating subsidiary has one purpose and one purpose only, and that's to carry out functions that the national bank itself could perform.</text>

            <text syncTime="3246.637" offset="13136204">What troubles me, and maybe you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very clear that there is visitation power to national banks and makes it very clear that there is not for subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.919" offset="13229305">And here is a regulation which under the guise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the national bank simply eliminates that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.043" offset="13273817">And it seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency regulation is allowed to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.697" offset="13296387">With respect, Justice Scalia, I don't think the statutes say that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.380" offset="13307150">There is a statute, 484(a), that says that the OCC's visitorial authority is exclusive with respect to national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.552" offset="13331809">But there is no statute that says that the OCC's visitorial authority is not exclusive with respect to subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.354" offset="13355006">There's another statute that deals with affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.356" offset="13363052">Now one point is that affiliates are not limited to subsidiaries, but they could include for example, I guess brother and sister corporations for lack of a better term, that are controlled by a common parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.430" offset="13403385">But another point is that at the time these statutes were enacted, Congress simply didn't have within its field of vision the notion that a national bank would have the power to exercise its functions through a subsidiary corporation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="3329.107" offset="13466079">Because what Congress was trying to do is to make sure that the OCC had exclusive visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of national bank function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.295" offset="13498784">It's just at the time that these statutes were enacted, the only play that national bank functions were being conducted was by a national bank itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.466" offset="13523548">Now later on, when the laws of all 50 states, the OTS, the Federal Reserve with respect to state member banks, and the comptroller gives banks the authority to conduct national... to conduct bank functions through its subsidiaries, then this issue arises about who exercises visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of those functions for a subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.928" offset="13597318">And it stands to reason that if the baseline rule is that with respect to the conduct of national bank functions through a national bank itself, the OCC visitorial authority is exclusive, then when a national bank exercises its Federal entitlement to conduct those very same functions through an operating subsidiary, the OCC's visitorial authority, likewise, would be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.472" offset="13671506">That seems to me to be an entirely reasonable regulatory determination by the comptroller, and there's nothing in those statutory provisions that speaks directly to that issue and that in any way precludes the comptroller from reaching that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.503" offset="13755620">I don't know about this particular case but there absolutely could be, Justice Ginsburg, because when they become subsidiaries they are controlled by the national bank and not by some other entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.241" offset="13786653">And the reason that a national bank would choose to engage in this sort of structure rather than folding the enterprise into the bank itself are many fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.430" offset="13823329">And in part it's for efficiency purposes because you can have focused management, especially when you're dealing with the sort of specialized things that operating subsidiaries typically do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.703" offset="13856452">But there's also other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.086" offset="13861990">For example, there's a modularity component to this in the sense that the best specialized functions such as mortgage lending, very often a national bank will purchase an entity that conducts that activity, and may be interested in selling the entity later, and it's much more straightforward to do that if those functions are maintained in a separate subsidiary corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.980" offset="14025517">So if the question is whether the corporate veil is pierced, state law would dictate an answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.101" offset="14045997">But, may I just finish one thought?</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.101" offset="14054043">States won't have an incentive to liberally construe veil piercing principles with respect to national banks precisely because state member banks in all 50 states also have operating subsidiaries through which they charter banks to conduct banking functions.</text>
