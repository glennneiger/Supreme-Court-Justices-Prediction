            <text syncTime="67.775" offset="427502">That, we submit, is an impermissible creation of a Federal common law rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.846" offset="6743805">And the harm comes from the fact that overwhelmingly the lower courts in the last 10 years have concluded that 502(b) and 506(b) mean that unsecured creditors do not have these claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.037" offset="12796586">Justice Breyer, in our brief on pages 25 and 26, we cite to a number of cases where the courts allowed attorneys' fees as an unsecured claim, both for pre-petition work done and also post-petition work done where the contractual right was pre-petitioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.296" offset="12857608">We also cite a bunch of cases around page 44... 43 and 44 of our brief, including an article in the middle of page 44, quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.318" offset="12893657">"In cases decided under the Bankruptcy Act, the higher courts consistently held that attorneys' fees were allowable even as unsecured claims in bankruptcy. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.924" offset="12932109">Close quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.591" offset="12934721">I've been a bankruptcy lawyer for over 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.876" offset="12943916">I've been teaching bankruptcy law for 17 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.495" offset="12954365">It is absolutely not true that courts routinely disallow claims for attorneys' fees as part of unsecured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.416" offset="12982055">It's the opposite is true it's routine that they are allowed in practical reality however they are not presented because creditors don't bother to present them because distributions are generally so low in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.956" offset="13024269">On the point about the plan completely protected the rights of the injured workers, nothing could be farther from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.443" offset="13050182">The provision that counsel cites in the plan refers to exec, as executory contracts, workers' compensation benefit programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.013" offset="13084455">Those are the contractual relationships between PG&amp;E and its administrators, not the claims of the workers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.453" offset="13110264">Tellingly, PG&amp;E never argued in the bankruptcy court that the claims of the workers were fine under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.272" offset="13137536">In fact, they said, we will do what Travelers wants after the bankruptcy court directed... and it's in the transcript... that that was the appropriate thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.760" offset="13167420">In fact, what Travelers insisted is required by Section 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code, claims such as the workers' must be classified, their treatment must be specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.234" offset="13205350">If they are not they are eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.251" offset="13213395">The reference to executory contracts clearly doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.270" offset="13225516">As we explain in our reply brief, the workers' claims were not executory contracts under applicable law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.007" offset="13244429">That section does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.959" offset="13252266">Of course, I think, Chief Justice Roberts, there is a lot more that we would like to say about their alternative arguments than we were able to put in our 20-page reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.815" offset="13287688">The issue that they raised has not been fully ventilated in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.783" offset="13303570">In fact, there are many more things we would say about it on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.801" offset="13319557">I also think it's important to point out, Justice Stevens, they are a solvent debtor, and under the concept of absolute priority shareholders are not allowed to recover anything unless creditors are paid in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.609" offset="13366891">What they are trying to do is they're trying to get rid of their contractual obligations in bankruptcy for the benefit of their shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.847" offset="13391759">There's no implication between creditors, creditors' recoveries in this case one versus the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.334" offset="13413702">In the Dow Corning case which we cite in our reply brief the Sixth Circuit expressly held where you have a solvent debtor you have to pay all of the attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.107" offset="13444840">That is an additional argument we would develop on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.159" offset="13457066">But all of their arguments about Section 506 and their interpretation of 502 simply don't matter, because as a solvent debtor they're not entitled to take advantage of that theory even if it were valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.264" offset="13497503">And we contend that it isn't valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.847" offset="13503773">The court of appeals have resoundingly rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.382" offset="13513908">The Second Circuit rejected it in United Merchants and Manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.168" offset="13529059">The Sixth Circuit rejected it in Dow Corning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.203" offset="13537209">The Eleventh Circuit it en banc in the Wellsville case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.655" offset="13551002">All of them considered the 506 argument that they're making and rejected it, and properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.059" offset="13572631">Counsel cites to Section 502(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.928" offset="13584125">That's an important section because that demonstrates that Congress understood that attorneys' fees would be allowable as an unsecured claim under Section 502.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.068" offset="13628638">And in Section 502(b)(4) it provided the only exception, the only one where attorneys' fees would not be allowable as an unsecured claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.107" offset="13664791">It provided expressly attorneys' fees would not be allowable for the attorney for the debtor to the extent the claim for the fees exceeded the reasonable value of the services performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.165" offset="13713066">Why is that provision there?</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.665" offset="13719022">Because Congress saw there was a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.934" offset="13728112">There was a problem of debtors sending money to their attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.153" offset="13745039">Congress understood that to be a problem and it remedied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.957" offset="13760191">Congress did not think there was a problem with respect to this historic practice of going on over 100 years of attorneys' fees being allowed as unsecured claims, and so in Section 502 it allows them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.280" offset="13809510">Respondents' argument about Section 506(b) renders Section 502(b)(4) superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.453" offset="13842215">If attorneys' fees were never allowable as part of an unsecured claim except for how 506(b) allows it, then there would not be a need for Section 502(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.142" offset="13884951">In addition, Respondent overstates the office of Section 506.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.963" offset="13904282">506, as this Court explained in Ron Pair, provides, essentially tells us what secured creditors get out of their collateral and in what order... the pre-petition amount and then, if there's any value left, the value of the collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.389" offset="13957990">After you pay the pre-petition amount of the claim, you can add attorneys' fees and you can add, post-petition you can add interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.626" offset="13986933">Their interpretation of Section 506(b) would render Section 502(b)(2) superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.447" offset="14010235">Under their theory, only oversecured creditors get post-petition interest, get interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3486.729" offset="14103335">That already happens, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.931" offset="14112112">In all the circuits that recognize that attorneys' fees are allowed as unsecured claims, that already happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.916" offset="14132070">And that has not cause any disaster or any problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.001" offset="14144399">It's been a practice for 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.536" offset="14150564">If Congress had wished to change the practice, it would have when it codified the Bankruptcy Code in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.524" offset="14178463">The fact that it hasn't perceived it to be a problem demonstrates that Congress wanted to leave the practice unchanged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.778" offset="14203541">Now, what happens, though, again, Justice Kennedy, is that creditors don't bother to file claims for those amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.515" offset="14226424">And where it matters is in cases where it should matter, like in this case, in the PG&amp;E case, where a solvent debtor is simply trying to get out of its contractual relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.806" offset="14267593">And under principles of absolute priority they are not allowed to do that for the benefit of shareholders where creditors are not being paid in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.643" offset="14298940">And I think it's important to underscore again, Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3555.290" offset="14377516">And perhaps maybe as a matter of policy, if we were to start from scratch, well, maybe we shouldn't allow attorneys' fees to be allowed in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.711" offset="14403221">Maybe we shouldn't allow tort claims to be allowed in bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3591.030" offset="14520563">The Randolph case was decided in 1903 and the law changed dramatically since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.284" offset="14541565">For example, in 1903 contingent claims were not provable under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.402" offset="14557970">That changed in 1938 when contingent claims became provable under the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.306" offset="14577614">Randolph &amp; Randolph versus Scruggs involved the claim of a custodian, a custodian, an assignee, who took control of all the debtor's assets before the bankruptcy filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.345" offset="14617738">Now under Section 503(b)(3)(E), the Randolph versus Scruggs analysis as it pertains to the claims of the assignee, those are now treated as an administrative expense under Section 503 dealing with administrative expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.088" offset="14676775">In Randolph, it's interesting, the fees... Justice Kennedy, the fees incurred in preparing the assignment were allowed as an unsecured claim in the bankruptcy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.479" offset="14714287">Justice Holmes for the Court said they are allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.431" offset="14726094">So in fact Randolph I think refutes their analysis rather than supports it.</text>
