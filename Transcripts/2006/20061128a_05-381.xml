            <text syncTime="13.711" offset="208079">The question in this case is whether the standards this Court adopted in Brooke Group to determine whether a seller's prices violate the antitrust laws because they are too low also should apply in assessing the claim that the buyer's purchase prices are illegally high.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.789" offset="264399">We submit that the Brooke Group test applies because the four key underpinnings of the Court's ruling apply fully here.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.325" offset="294596">First, there's a high risk of mistaking aggressive competition for anticompetitive behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.869" offset="316748">Increasing the prices that are paid for inputs like lowering sales prices is a mechanism by which a firm competes.</text>

            <text syncTime="51.315" offset="358544">So the conduct targeted here is on its face identical to core procompetitive conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.349" offset="1110662">But this Court in the Trinko case has certainly interpreted the Brooke Standard as also applying to claims under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.265" offset="1146293">And in fact the Court explicitly said that in Brooke Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.779" offset="1156428">As I said, the first critical underpinning is the risk of mistaking aggressive competition for anticompetitive behavior.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.957" offset="1205120">Well, it's a little different here in that in the Brooke Group cases, of course, the alleged anticompetitive conduct was pricing too low, which has at least a direct benefit to consumers either in the short term, certainly in the short term, and arguably in the long-term as well, while here that is not the form in which the anticompetitive conduct, that's not the form the anticompetitive conduct takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.764" offset="1304281">So isn't that a reason not to think that we should apply the Brooke Group test to this situation?</text>

            <text syncTime="292.856" offset="1324657">--Your Honor, we don't, we don't think that that difference is a distinction that warrants a different test, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.810" offset="1348480">First of all, we are dealing here with single firm pricing conduct and it's recognized that that's key to the proper functioning of the markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.887" offset="1380872">As the court said in Professional Engineers, fixed pricing is the central nervous system of the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.960" offset="1401143">It allocates goods and ensures that, that they are allocated to the most efficient use.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.225" offset="1426221">Here, although there's no immediate benefit to consumers, there is an immediate benefit to the sellers of the logs, who certainly benefit when competition drives up the prices that they achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.852" offset="1472719">And we think that the Sherman Act protects them and gives them the benefit of full competition just as much as it does consumers.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.735" offset="1788173">Well, you don't have that in this case, do you, because I thought the, I thought one of the arguments on the other side was the inelasticity of the supplies, so that no matter what they were paying, basically the same amount of wood was ultimately going to get processed; is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="422.605" offset="1843657">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.056" offset="1845538">The claim is that the supply was relatively inelastic, not that it's perfectly inelastic, and as long as the supply market is not perfectly inelastic, an increase in price may lead to more supplies, maybe not as much as if there were higher elasticity, but more.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.596" offset="1899664">But there's another benefit to consumers here, which is that if one would expect that a buyer bidding more can make a more efficient use of the product and therefore generate more output, and that output expansion which doesn't depend on supply expansion is also beneficial to consumers because that means there will be more output in the downstream market and a corresponding decrease in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.199" offset="1986077">So we have those two benefits to consumers and we also have the fact that as the Court said in Professional Engineers, the Sherman Act reflects a judgment that price competition generally, a free and open price competition will produce lower prices and better goods and services, and the Court has not required that that be traced to consumer welfare in every particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="481.606" offset="2079700">If you have a firm that has developed a new, a new technique for processing the logs, and it can process them cheaper and faster, and sell them for a lower price but in greater volume, and thereby make even more profit, that firm would be willing to pay more for those logs, even though it would sell them for less than competitors might sell them.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.916" offset="2632973">Because we, the charges that some logs were purchased at an excessive price, and if we were dealing with only those logs to determine cost, that's one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.976" offset="2697130">But we are, also in this picture is that some of the logs came from Weyerhaeuser's own land and some came from long-term contracts that it had, and those, the price was not inflated on those.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.197" offset="2770064">So if you take those into account you may get one figure, but if you take only the high bid logs you might get a different picture.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.830" offset="3140585">We think the issue is symmetrical and it might be that the focus is on the incremental costs that are associated with the alleged predatory volume, and therefore that might focus on those incremental costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.767" offset="3188337">But in this case there's no dispute that, whatever the measure of costs, there has been no challenge to the position that Weyerhaeuser's prices were above those costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.454" offset="3227102">Let me just turn back to, to the other two reasons why we think Brooke Group applies because I think they're important.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.892" offset="3272869">The third is it's much more likely that the high bids here were going to, were a result of legitimate competition than of anticompetitive effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.857" offset="3304738">As this Court has observed both in Brooke Group and Matsushita, predatory conduct is self-deterring.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.248" offset="3326263">To engage in it, the defendant has to be willing to incur a near-term loss against the hope of higher returns later.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.483" offset="3351236">And as the Court explained in those cases, the loss is definite but the gain depends on a number of imponderables.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.567" offset="3375582">So there is some self-deterring.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.859" offset="3380702">And finally, a test that provides no guidance threatens false positives that will deter the very competition that our economy requires and that helps our economy reach its most efficient state.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.206" offset="3426051">As Justice Breyer put it for the First Circuit in Town of Concord, antitrust rules must be clear enough for lawyers to explain them to their clients, especially in a sensitive area like pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.493" offset="3463249">And certainly the rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted here has none of that clarity and we think that the Court's Brooke Group decision and that test does.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.339" offset="6110603">High barriers to entry, Justice Alito, would be very relevant to the inquiry under the second prong of the Brooke Group standard, namely whether the defendant had a dangerous probability of recoupment in the long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.348" offset="6162639">And indeed in many predation cases, many predatory pricing cases in the 13 years since Brooke Group, barriers to entry have been absolutely vital in resolving predatory pricing claims at the summary judgment stage, because typically defendants will make the argument that the absence of barriers to entry make the possibility of recoupment unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.972" offset="6253127">But that is a consideration that is built into the Brooke Group standard and it certainly would be part of the Brooke Group analysis in the predatory bidding context as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.739" offset="6296281">I want to say just one thing in response to Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy's questions to my friend Mr. Pincus about the question of the appropriate measure of cost if Brooke Group were to apply to predatory bidding claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.249" offset="6354273">As in Brooke Group itself, we believe that it is unnecessary for this Court to specify the exact method of calculating costs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.635" offset="6387814">But the position of the United States more generally both in the predatory pricing context and in the predatory bidding context is that a Court should look to a defendant's incremental costs, and in this context that would mean looking to the amount of the input that was the subject of the alleged predation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.924" offset="6460957">So in this case the amount of logs that petitioner allegedly predatorily purchased on the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.331" offset="6490632">And such an incremental approach to be sure is not within its difficulties in application and for that reason a number of lower courts in the predatory pricing context have instead looked to average variable costs or other measures as a proxy for incremental costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.342" offset="6558655">But we believe that in a case such as this one, looking to incremental costs may be useful because it effectively excludes from the analysis any potential cross-subsidization, whether by virtue of the fact that in this case, for example, petitioner may have harvested logs from its own lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.464" offset="6631171">There are claims in this case that petitioner entered into various exclusive dealing arrangements as well, obtained logs at a lower price on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.509" offset="6663354">And an incremental approach has the virtue of focusing only on that portion of the market that is the subject of the alleged predation claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.294" offset="12618436">The recoupment is the opportunity to drive log costs down to recoup the extra costs you pay during the predatory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.288" offset="12650410">And we had evidence in the record that a former executive from Weyerhaeuser testified that they had used this strategy multiple times, that when it was questioned by some in top management that the head of a division would always say once we either acquire or get rid of a competitor, we will recoup those costs many fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.582" offset="12735569">That's at JA 260, Cliff Chulos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.285" offset="12746436">We also had at JA 903 a planning document in 2001 where Weyerhaeuser was showing in that PowerPoint chart the expectation that log prices would be going down in '01, '02, '03, and for every 2 percent change downward it was an extra $2 million in profits to the bottom line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.043" offset="12849463">There was no plan to pass on the benefits of those lower input prices to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.387" offset="12878825">Obvious consumer lack of benefit in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.912" offset="12900872">Also as to recoupment, if you look at JA 831 to 95, which are the year-end financials for the Weyerhaeuser alder mills in Oregon, Washington and BC during a roughly four-year period, you see a monu... a huge price differential between the prices in British Columbia and those prevailing in Oregon and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.257" offset="12994286">We think there was every expectation on management's part to drive the prices down to the levels that prevailed in British Columbia, which works out to about $40 million a year, way way above the amount they were spending in this predatory scheme predominantly in Oregon and Washington, because there is no competition in British Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.479" offset="13071190">But I would like to point out that they never preserved the issue of whether or not the standard that the Ninth Circuit in dictum stated was as a whole sufficient to guide the jury as to a definition of anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.951" offset="13137124">At page 43 of their brief after quoting this paragraph they so criticize, they note, although that statement of the law... this is 43 of the Ninth Circuit brief, not the blue brief that you have... although that statement of the law may have been acceptable when Reed Brothers was decided, it is not in the wake of Brooke Group for reasons explained above.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.044" offset="13225417">The point here is that they never made any charge in the Ninth Circuit that the instruction was flawed independent of Brooke Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.601" offset="13263661">Now we concede, if Brooke Group applies, the instruction was... was... is wrong, and the case should be reversed and remanded.</text>

            <text syncTime="3398.761" offset="13748284">And I suggest that you look to the type of formulation I gave a little earlier where you're looking at how much did the defendant push the market to levels that are above where it otherwise would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.009" offset="13805336">It's not too far from the test that is proposed by the State at page 29 of their brief where they suggest it's, that the conduct be measured by whether it raised the price that the buyer's rivals had to pay for the input beyond a level that could be justified or explained by other market or exogenous factors and substantially affected the ability of the buyer's rivals to compete for the input.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.838" offset="13920588">The eight States, all of which have concerns both as sellers into these vulnerable resource markets and for citizens and companies in their own resource State, laden States, whether it's mineral, whether it's agriculture, they have that concern and they've offered that test that's not too far from what I posited as a way to improve the instruction that Weyerhaeuser invited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.515" offset="14027377">I'd like to make one further point on that subject and that is, if you look at the opening statement of their counsel, the closing, he used that very language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.552" offset="14071471">They were going to put on witnesses who would all state that they never bought more than they needed, they never paid more than necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.521" offset="14131344">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.174" offset="14137927">Just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.886" offset="14144823">With respect to the story of how this instruction came to be, in fact it closely resembles some language that was requested by respondent that appears on page 93A of the joint appendix which refers to a test that paying a price for logs with higher than market value unnecessarily to drive out or injure competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.762" offset="14240327">So I do think that this is an instruction that comes from respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.295" offset="14262479">It's true that we did not request a Brooke Group instruction because the district court had ruled that Brooke Group didn't apply at the summary judgment phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.621" offset="14295706">We did object to the instruction proposed by the district judge on the grounds that it did not conform with Brooke Group in order to preserve our argument here and we believe that that objection gives the Court the power to adopt an intermediate rule, but it isn't exactly what we requested and there are decisions in the court of appeals of to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.295" offset="14378462">With respect to the question about purchasing more logs than they needed, as we say in our briefs we think that that claim can't really be separated from the predatory pricing claim here because the argument is that by purchasing more logs the price was driven up and it's the increased price, that's the impact that respondent complains of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.336" offset="14450665">So creating a separate overbuying claim that relies on price for impact would be the same thing as saying on the sell side you can have an overselling claim regardless of whether you flunk the Brooke Group standard with respect to prices, and that's just going to undercut the certainty that this Court has prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.807" offset="14520464">With respect to the document that Mr. Haglund cited, 901A about the inputs, that document is described in testimony in the joint appendix at 571A to 573A, and that's a hypothetical look at what the market might would look like if current, past purchasing patterns had continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.921" offset="14596950">It's not a document that in any way says that the various sources of log supply were locked up and it doesn't indicate that, and in fact there's nothing in the record to indicate what the percentage of logs were that were available to Weyerhaeuser by long-term contract, in contrast, as I said, to the testimony in the record that indicates that respondent got between 30 and 50 percent of its logs through those long-term sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.246" offset="14694230">With respect to the proper disposition of the case, in the Boyle case this Court made clear that where there's no, not sufficient evidence in the record... I'm sorry, my time is up.</text>
