            <text syncTime="10.309" offset="195866">This case is here for the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.323" offset="203912">In your summary of reversal, this Court held that Petitioner's mitigating evidence could not be given adequate consideration through the Texas special issues or the nullification instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.350" offset="248006">On remand, the CCA found the error harmless by concluding the opposite, that Petitioner's jury could give sufficient consideration to his mitigating evidence, including specifically the evidence of his 78 IQ, learning disabilities and troubled background.</text>

            <text syncTime="43.592" offset="328986">I thought our holding was that given the instructions, the jury would not necessarily take into account those mitigating factors, and I thought that what the Texas court held is, yes, that was a possibility, and we have to see whether that possibility came to pass, which is what harmless error analysis involves.</text>

            <text syncTime="83.185" offset="487393">That doesn't contradict our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.935" offset="494393">I mean, you might want to argue against it on the merits, but I don't think that will contradict our opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.948" offset="526472">Your opinion said that Petitioner's mitigating evidence had little or nothing to do with the inquiries of the special issues, and your opinion also said that the nullification instruction, no matter how clearly conveyed or fully understood by the jury, would not solve that problem.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>

            <text syncTime="110.346" offset="596062">And that means that the jury was not instructed to take it into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.532" offset="624797">And I think the Texas court is conceding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.749" offset="637649">But it's, it's saying, nonetheless, we don't think that the error made any difference because, in our view, the jury did take it into account.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jordan Steiker</label>
            <text syncTime="131.870" offset="682161">The matter in which the CCA posited that the jury could take it into account was the fact that on voir dire, the jurors said we can follow a nullification instruction and falsify our answers to the special issues in order to give effect to mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.986" offset="750602">That was the exact same proposition that the CCA had issued in its first opinion that this Court summarily reversed.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="156.702" offset="781427">Yes, but it seems to me it's one thing to use it for the purpose of saying the instruction was okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.591" offset="805041">And it's something else to use it for the purpose of saying even though the instruction didn't require that, it was a fuzzy instruction and a juror could very reasonably have understood it not to allow nullification, nonetheless, we have satisfied ourselves that the jury indeed thought it had the nullification power.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.926" offset="890305">I don't see how it contradicts our opinion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jordan Steiker</label>
            <text syncTime="185.958" offset="898455">I think what's contradictory, Your Honor, is that the notion that the nullification instruction would be an adequate vehicle was what this Court specifically rejected.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="195.705" offset="937430">They didn't say it was an adequate vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.782" offset="945789">I mean, they acknowledged that that instruction shouldn't be given again because it doesn't require the jury to do what, what you say the jury must do, and I think they accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.778" offset="985809">They say, oh, no, I thought it was fuzzy, and didn't require... we think the jury did indeed think it had the power to nullify.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jordan Steiker</label>
            <text syncTime="215.479" offset="1016529">And I would also add that when you actually look at the voir dire on which the CCA relied in which it said jurors express no discomfort, no hesitation about their willingness to falsify their answers to the special issues, the very first juror in this case, a lawyer, expressed exactly the kinds of discomfort that this Court feared and anticipated with the use of the nullification instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.306" offset="1159889">Do you concede that harmless error analysis is ever appropriate, is ever open as an option following an, in effect, a finding of this kind of instructional error, Penry I instructional error?</text>

            <text syncTime="2794.999" offset="11334687">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.902" offset="11370214">I represent California and 20 other states who are concerned about the implications of Petitioner's arguments for their ability to apply their own varied harmless error standards in their own State habeas proceedings, and thereby to strike what they believe to be the right balance between the two competing concerns that this Court identified in Calderon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.814" offset="11469897">One being the significant social costs of retrial or resentencing, and the other the desire to ensure that the extraordinary remedy of habeas corpus is available to those whom society has grievously wronged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.496" offset="11524650">And with those concerns in mind, I'd like to address three specific points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.979" offset="11542517">The first is the whole question of whether States have the ability under our Federal Constitution to choose their own harmless error standards even when they are addressing Federal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.787" offset="11589747">Petitioner appears to concede as a general matter that States do have that authority, but let me just briefly indicate why that concession is well founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.501" offset="11628617">First of all, as this Court has held in Pennsylvania versus Finley--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2873.296" offset="11647843">Are you talking about both collateral review and direct review, or just collateral review?</text>

            <text syncTime="2877.966" offset="11666547">--I'm just talking about collateral review right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.325" offset="11675951">As this Court has held in Pennsylvania versus Finley, the States are under no obligation to provide collateral review at all, and so it would be extraordinary if they take the step of deciding that they will provide such review, for this Court to say, well, if you're going to do that you have to apply a Federal standard on State habeas review rather than the standard that you choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.660" offset="11765290">Secondly, to the extent the States decide to provide habeas review or any other kind of post-conviction review, the authority by which they do that derives from State law, not from the Federal Constitution or any other Federal law, and this Court obviously does not have general supervisory authority over, over State courts as it does Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.385" offset="11860166">And third, unlike the situation with direct review, this Court could not as a practical matter impose a Federal standard on State habeas proceedings without being highly intrusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.558" offset="12004885">And let's suppose further the State has no independent State ground, they are not trying to make the argument, whether or not they're trying to make it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.892" offset="13642240">It's one thing on direct review of a State criminal conviction to say as a matter of Federal constitutional law we think there was an error here and we're going to nullify the conviction, which is what the Constitution gives this Court the power to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.918" offset="13702321">But it's quite another, after the conviction is final and the defendant is already incarcerated, then on a State habeas proceeding for the issue to come, to come back to this Court, it would be extraordinary for this Court to say, well, you have to apply Federal standards or Federally dictated procedures in that circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.455" offset="13800437">I'd like to return to the record in this case because I think once it's clarified what the nature of the evidence was in this case it's clear that this Court could find that the error was harmful under any standard, including the egregious harm standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.308" offset="13863863">We have in this case over 200 pages of exhibits documenting a lifelong disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.337" offset="13891970">This evidence was first introduced in the guilt-innocence phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.599" offset="13909002">It was argued at the guilt-innocence closing argument, in which trial counsel said, this is a 19-year-old ninth grader who has been charged with this crime, and argued that that was the basis for considering him less culpable than his college-educated co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.545" offset="13984862">During the punishment phase, it's clear that the single most important witness, the one whose testimony was the most central, the most time-consuming, was Alberta Pingle, who brought in all of the school records showing from at the time the Petitioner was in school he had been diagnosed as a learning disabled, possibly organic in nature, 78 IQ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.129" offset="14071170">And his counsel emphasized this as the central basis for withholding a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.752" offset="14093636">He said, this man has a 78 IQ, 8 points from being mentally retarded, lifelong learning disabilities, possibly organic in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.593" offset="14129058">And the argument that there was no evidence of abuse in this case is belied by the fact that the evidence showed that Petitioner's father chased him with a butcher knife in order to steel the family's car in order to support his crack habit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.275" offset="14183706">If that's not evidence of abuse and evidence that could show reduced culpability for this defendant, coupled especially with his impairment which made him less capable of responding to that role model and avoiding dangerous behavior--</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.278" offset="14307735">As this Court noted in its summary reversal, the prosecutor got up right before defense counsel and said: You promised us on voir dire you would answer the special issues honestly and that if the evidence supported a yes answer to deliberateness and dangerousness you would give us yes answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.287" offset="14383804">Basically, right before he spoke the prosecutor gave an anti-nullification instruction which said this evidence isn't relevant to the special issues of deliberateness and dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.219" offset="14431556">In that posture, he was left to argue that the evidence showed he wasn't dangerous, that the evidence showed he didn't act deliberately, and just hope that the jury would be willing to lie on the special verdict form.</text>

            <text syncTime="3603.391" offset="14568228">Our argument is that when you take out the clearly impermissible Federal conclusion that the jury could give effect to this evidence, which was exactly what this Court said to the contrary in its summary reversal... this Court said this evidence couldn't be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.449" offset="14628415">The State court said he has extensive evidence, he has powerful evidence, powerfully presented, dramatically presented, but we think, unlike the Supreme Court, that a carefully crafted nullification instruction will facilitate the jurors' consideration of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.473" offset="14696542">So if you take away the impermissible Federal conclusion, this Court could clearly conceive, conclude, on the basis of the State court's own characterization of this evidence, which departs tremendously from the Respondent's view, that this was powerful mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.216" offset="14767490">The Court of Criminal Appeals' error was to conclude that this could be taken into account after this Court said exactly the opposite.</text>
