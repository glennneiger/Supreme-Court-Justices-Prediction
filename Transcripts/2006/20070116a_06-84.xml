            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="12.871" offset="200074">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.401" offset="214180">I'd like to turn first to the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the term "willfully" and its determination that the case had to be remanded for further proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore Petitioners' communications with their counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.112" offset="273112">We ask this Court to find that there is no necessity for any such inquiry for waivers of attorney-client privilege because summary judgment should have been affirmed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.358" offset="322014">Petitioners and their counsel, if you think about what communications you might find, they could not have known anything more about these statutory issues of first impression than the district court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.479" offset="370497">It's questions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.962" offset="376453">And if the district court's opinion does not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the reading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate to characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same views as either a knowing or reckless violation of the, of the FCRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.422" offset="458268">The first... the Ninth Circuit nevertheless reached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to go ahead and look at privileged communications if the Petitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made self-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.073" offset="524933">And the first is that they read willfully in this setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several cases where this Court has read the term willfully in civil statutes to mean recklessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.020" offset="572685">But this Court has said repeatedly that the word willfully is contextual, that you have to look at all of the sections of the statute to see how it's used to determine whether it means with knowledge that your conduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations are sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.622" offset="647081">And in this particular statute, unlike the other three that were at issue, Congress has used the term willfully in other sections of the law to mean, as Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that their conduct violates the Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>

            <text syncTime="143.678" offset="723359">That appears in several other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.929" offset="864316">And that would make perfect sense in this setting, and so the term willfully when, again, used--</text>

            <text syncTime="204.964" offset="968492">--Your Honor, in Ratzlaf, the phrase was willfully, not willfully and knowingly, and the Court held that it meant that you knew that your conduct violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.024" offset="1004750">And that seems to be the most reasonable reading here because if you look, there are also sections of Section 1681n that refer to knowing conduct, and that would require the conclusion that Congress used willfully in this section to mean a... a less... a more... a less culpable mens rea than knowingly.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.238" offset="1353537">And in these circumstances, you can't say that there was a high risk of illegality because what the district court found is that the Petitioners' interpretations of the statute were actually not only reasonable, but correct, and having--</text>

            <text syncTime="353.435" offset="1562307">Because for instance, users are told what the permissible purposes are when they get a credit report from, from a credit agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.385" offset="1598147">But more importantly, Your Honor, I think that the use of the term knowingly there can also be explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.632" offset="1623121">If you look at Section 1681h, it actually provides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless there is a willful intent to injure, except as provided in Section 1681n, and they are the same kinds of actions that are carved out in 1681n.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.654" offset="1711205">And so I think it was to make clear, I think it was to make clear that you didn't have to have a willful intent to injure.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.949" offset="1736387">So even if they meant it to be interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law there, I think there was a reason for it, it wasn't just surplusage.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.534" offset="1986745">But that the form of recklessness that Congress presumably used here in this setting, where there is the potential for very punitive sanctions, was what is referred to... Farmer versus Brennan calls it "criminal", the criminal recklessness standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.104" offset="2049021">And that means that not only do you have to have an objectively high risk of illegality, but you must be actually conscious of that risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.113" offset="6645109">It did not do so in connection with the claims here under Section 1681n(a)(1)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.641" offset="6675202">In each instance where Congress wanted to allow... to require a higher mens rea, it said so and did so in connection with liability that was greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.839" offset="6723999">They required knowing mens rea for the criminal provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.541" offset="6738732">They required knowing mens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages that are available under the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.742" offset="6767571">What do you say to the argument from drafting history that looks at the history both of little n and little o and it points out that as originally, in the original bill, little o providing for the actual damages required a finding of gross negligence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.295" offset="6853775">Little n used the word "willful" just as it does now, suggesting that willful would not include gross negligence or something close to gross negligence like recklessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.807" offset="6907796">Then in, then in o, they changed the standard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but they made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed whatever it always was, and if the argument from contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than reckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was changed to negligence in o.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.573" offset="7058889">I don't think that tells us much about willful means, what willful means as a separate matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.192" offset="7121374">And they must have had something in mind, probably had in mind, something in n which was a standard higher than gross negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.704" offset="7155437">No, Justice Souter, I suggest that what you can infer from that is that, if anything, is perhaps Congress wanted to move, make clear that under o the actual damages aren't close to willful or reckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.415" offset="7218236">But that still doesn't tell us separately what "willful" meant, and of course "willful" had been interpreted by this Court in similar cases involving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.973" offset="7268495">And I respectfully disagree with--</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.329" offset="7301932">But we also keep repeating, you know, "willful" is a word of many meanings and you always look to the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.514" offset="7330667">And here the argument is that if you look to the context of the, of the two statutory sections right up next to each other, you can draw a, an inference about what "willful" means.</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.055" offset="7388867">--I think if anything, Justice Souter, here the context should be the actual statutory terms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly required the knowing standard and that's a knowing violation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed to draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.704" offset="7463473">And the statute directly defines what a permissible purpose is under this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.546" offset="7474758">So that reference to knowing could not refer to a knowing, knowing the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.607" offset="7491058">And of course, willful in some sense always includes some knowledge of the factual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.902" offset="7512270">In addition, the logical structure of the act... as I mentioned, we had negligence and actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.025" offset="7536721">We have a reckless standard, a knowing or reckless standard for certain statutory damages, but then an even higher level for the criminal and higher statutory penalty provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.348" offset="7586040">And as I started to say, a willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely consistent with how this Court has interpreted the term in similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about the same time the Hazen Paper case and Thurston and McLaughlin cases interpreting the ADA and the FLSA and other similar cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.813" offset="12283901">If I could start by just responding to the issue of the new document, I just want to emphasize that this document was created by people who weren't lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.560" offset="12322876">It was done before GEICO even started using credit to price insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.543" offset="12338758">They were... said they were brainstorming about what the statute might mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.511" offset="12354641">And I would point the Court to the supplemental excerpt of records at 504 where when GEICO implemented the policy that we're talking about here, the... they said that the intent was that we would send to the people who were supposed to get the adverse action notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.393" offset="12426216">With the early systems development we didn't have the ability to identify whether they were supposed to receive the notice or not; that was because they had not yet developed the way to do with what they call the neutral, where they compare how the applicant would have done if they hadn't taken credit, hadn't taken credit into account at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.760" offset="12503643">And this is a procedure that's required actually in most States in order to ensure that those who don't want to allow access to credit reports or who don't have a sufficient credit history are not treated adversely in the meaning of those State laws, and that means worse than the average loss ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.361" offset="12586085">So there's nothing in this record, even if you take into account the documents they're talking about, to suggest that there was somehow a knowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.373" offset="12626105">With respect to a few of the factual or... issues that came up, Safeco estimates that approximately 80 percent of all consumers that they are selling new insurance to now have to get notice under the standards established by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.398" offset="12690157">With respect to who can qualify for the top tier of credit, it's only, at least at GEICO, approximately 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.362" offset="12730072">So 90 percent of the consumers would not qualify for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.017" offset="12744701">And the statute very plainly does not prohibit differential treatment based on persons with better credit, nor do State laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.873" offset="12780123">And so the analogy as to race discrimination simply don't hold water, because there Congress has told you what the baseline is, you can't treat any person of a different race in a different way, and that's not true under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.743" offset="12831636">And instead, it's quite reasonable, as GEICO has concluded, to simply say look, if we wouldn't... if we're treating you worse than we would have treated you if we ever looked at your credit report, worse than if you had an average loss ratio for this criteria, we'll send you the notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.571" offset="12990879">And so, again, it's just one factor of 15 though.</text>
