            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="8.754" offset="184920">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="197145">The Eighth Circuit held that Philip Morris is subject to such specific and detailed regulations by the Federal Trade Commission that it is entitled to remove this purely State law case from State court to Federal court under the Federal officer removal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.869" offset="273318">That holding is erroneous and should be reversed for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.339" offset="299232">First, the court articulated the wrong test for determining when a person is acting under a Federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.779" offset="329012">Second, the court misunderstood the Federal Trade Commission's regulatory regime with respect to the marketing of so-called light cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.635" offset="364434">And third, the court's approach ignores the long history and purposes of the federal officer removal provision to protect the Federal Government operations from interference by State court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.209" offset="422739">In this case, and in this Court, Philip Morris largely abandons the Eighth Circuit's rationale and offers an alternate ground of affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.564" offset="456071">It should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.350" offset="463281">The FTC has not delegated authority to conduct testing to Philip Morris, and the complaint in any event challenges only the company's marketing and not its testing of so-called light cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.010" offset="517929">Now with respect to the first point, the Eighth Circuit applied and articulated the wrong test for determining when a person is acting under a federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.966" offset="557740">The proper test, as this Court's case in the City of Greenwood versus Peacock Casey elucidates, is when the person is aiding or acting on behalf of the Federal officer in a subordinate role in the officer's discharge of official functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.177" offset="626598">That is not what is happening here.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.210" offset="634749">What is happening here is that the Federal Trade Commission for a time conducted testing on the tar and nicotine levels of cigarettes and stopped doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.168" offset="678530">Philip Morris asserts that that sequence of events caused, in effect, a delegation of this authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.030" offset="1057932">What they held was that that method, the Cambridge filter method, had not been done according to rulemaking, a trade regulation rule; and that, therefore, there might be a testing mechanism that would be different and better, but that with respect to undertaking the deception analysis, which is what the FTC is charged by... with doing under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission... Federal Trade Act, it had to determine whether or not there would be some method that the cigarette makers were attempting to use that would be deceptive; and what the court in the D.C.

            <text syncTime="294.840" offset="1329188">You know, the strength of seat belts and stuff, and they specify very precise means to which those tests have to be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.780" offset="1360953">And if someone, a manufacturer is complying with those requirements, and a challenge is brought, saying something to the effect that that test doesn't give you a good measure or something, in that situation would this removal provision apply?</text>

            <text syncTime="338.536" offset="1503999">That's also compliance with the law, and that happens all the time in the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.588" offset="1520195">The Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Federal Reserve, all of those agencies routinely require reporting on the part of industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.744" offset="1552796">But the reporting of information does not transform a regulated entity into a Federal officer for purposes of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.849" offset="1585292">And the court's cases are highly instructive in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.801" offset="1597100">Beginning with the act of 1815 that began the Federal officer removal, the court's cases have held that when a person is deemed to be acting under, the person is acting in a subordinate relationship to the Federal officer, merely complying with the law does not transform a regulated entity into someone subordinate to the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.267" offset="1690932">And that subordinate relationship is what is critical to understanding when in other contexts someone might have a better claim to being a person acting under a Federal officer than Philip Morris can assert in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.581" offset="1880163">But I think that the proper way of looking at Government contractors is to look at contextually what is the nature of the contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="440.420" offset="1911509">Does the contract provide for ongoing supervision by the Federal officer and give the Federal officer the power to change or alter the conduct of the contracting party?</text>
            <text syncTime="452.311" offset="1959157">Otherwise, mere specifications, detailed as they might be, constitute simply compliance with the terms of the contract rather than a subordinate relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.304" offset="5707101">So if Federal officers were running that cafeteria, those Federal officers could remove because they are performing a duty under Federal law to provide that service to Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.128" offset="5762376">Now, once the statute expanded out in 1948 to cover Federal officers who perform any function, not just enforcement functions, it carried with it persons who act under Federal officers in performing those very same functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2562.784" offset="10400992">And then it becomes the FTC official ratings which they then must transmit to the company in their advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.206" offset="10430667">And now they're sued because those ratings that they've done according, for the FTC, according to the FTC standards, are alleged to be misleading.</text>

            <text syncTime="2582.281" offset="10478941">It is a whole spectrum; the testing itself and the reporting... is done by the industry because the FTC wants it as its official numbers, and it wants its official numbers given to the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.191" offset="10538605">And it is setting an advisory opinion, even if you tell them that your cigarettes have higher tar or lower tar, if you don't report our numbers, you will be sued for deceptive advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.042" offset="14322076">Philip Morris was the one that complained and said that cigarette doesn't comply, it's been manipulating the FTC Cambridge filter method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.629" offset="14356349">So the FTC found a cheaper way to do regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.933" offset="14369619">Compliance with rules does not transform an entity into a Federal officer.</text>
