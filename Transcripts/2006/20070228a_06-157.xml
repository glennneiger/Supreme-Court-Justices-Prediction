            <text syncTime="9.012" offset="195590">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.589" offset="209906">In Flast against Cohen, this Court recognized narrow circumstances in which a taxpayer could satisfy the requirements of Article III in challenging a congressional exercise of its spending and taxing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.240" offset="260583">This court in doing so rejected the suggestion of Justice Douglas that it allow all taxpayers to sue in all manner of claims, as well as the slightly more modest suggestion of Justices Stewart and Fortas that the Court allow taxpayer standing for all establishment clause challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.561" offset="325889">This Court's subsequent cases such as Valley Forge have made clear just how narrow the rule of Flast is.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.293" offset="352743">In order for a taxpayer to satisfy the requirements of Article III, the taxpayer must challenge a congressional exercise of the taxing and spending authority, and assert that the act of spending itself is what gives rise to the establishment clause violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.522" offset="413661">The court of appeals in the decision below substantially expanded the scope of taxpayer standing and in doing so, the court adopted a doctrine that I think can fairly be only understood as an exception to, not an application of normal principles of Article III standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.530" offset="481684">The court did so on the rationale that there is much that the executive branch can do to violate the establishment cause, but there is much that all three branches of Government could conceivably do to violate the establishment clause, and that has never been thought a sufficient reason to extend taxpayer standing to all Government action, nor has it been thought a sufficient reason to relax the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III.</text>

            <text syncTime="1174.545" offset="4857821">One, in Bowen, there was... there is certainly always a degree of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.480" offset="4873494">But it is worth noting that in Bowen as in Flast, the statute itself on its face made clear that money was to go to outside entities that were religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.899" offset="4907140">In Bowen it did so in express terms by four times referring to religious organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.257" offset="4924590">In Flast it did so by saying money was going to go, or in-kind aid, rather, was to going to go to private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.816" offset="4950817">And that was at a time when this Court roughly contemporaneously, in Lemon v Kurtzman that 93 percent of the private schools were religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.921" offset="4979238">The both of those, the gravamen of what's the complaint, that money is being spent by Congress on religious entities, was not within the discretion of the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.434" offset="5017377">And again, the way I would understand Kendrick is simply reconciling Valley Forge and Flast and Cohen to preserve, not broad challenges to Executive Branch action, which would have overruled Valley Forge, but rather to simply preserve the notion that you can bring an as-applied challenge to a spending statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.124" offset="5140048">Because whether it is spent by the Executive under an Executive program, which you have said can violate the establishment clause as well as a congressional program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2446.014" offset="9943653">I mean, I see that deciding what's incidental and what isn't incidental will be difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.652" offset="9966222">I guess many of these cases would end up being decided on the merits, there is no violation on the merits, or maybe sometimes there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.601" offset="9997987">But I'd started thinking of the question of standing by thinking that there are strong feelings when the Government spends money in favor of one religion and not another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.129" offset="10036126">After all, they led to the 30 Years War.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.175" offset="10048247">We see that in other places in the world today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.517" offset="10057651">People feel strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.439" offset="10065383">And if, in fact, they have that terribly strong feeling and can't make any challenge because the feelings are shared by many, then there are no cases in the courts at all, and the Government can do what it wants without challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.871" offset="10119091">So in Flast, they carved out an exception, and the exception was where the taxing and spending clauses were involved, because Madison and others said this is aimed at</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.756" offset="10166634">"Government shall not tax and spend. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.490" offset="10173530">So that was my theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.333" offset="10180949">And all we're saying is where there's a big taxing and spending and it isn't incidental, there's standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.065" offset="10203832">Now we're worried about the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2515.470" offset="10221491">To which the response was, which has me a little worried frankly, was that, well, that was Justice Stewart's position, or roughly speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.654" offset="10250226">But the Court rejected that quite clearly, and if you look at later cases, they reject it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.699" offset="10274363">And therefore, whatever you might think of it, it isn't the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.394" offset="10517197">And what he said here is he was just explaining his reason why he believed that Flast was distinguishable from Frothingham, and notes specifically that taxpayers have a clear stake because of the threepence comment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.205" offset="13020459">There is a passage in Valley Forge that refers to executive action, but the Court in Kendrick when it talked about Valley Forge said, in characterizing that case, said executive action pursuant to the property clause.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="3286.021" offset="13303626">Well, I think that the Court decided that it made a difference, and I think in terms of cabining, in terms of the worry that perhaps Flast is going to be overbroad and the need to have Congress involved, which I think is key... there was no congressional involvement at all in designating those properties and there is in the appropriations context, and I think that's a key difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.386" offset="13393174">But I think what's important here, and the Court's colloquy in the first part of the argument showed me this... but the Government's position, the idea that it's only grants to third parties... the Government could hire a corps of chaplains and send them out to civilians and to the populace at large and that couldn't be challenged, because all it is is executive pay; and the Idea that there's some difference between a Bowen v. Kendrick situation, where the executive had tremendous discretion in terms of where it was going to give the money, and the situation here, which is the exercise of Precisely the same executive discretion, makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.357" offset="13521070">The injury is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.951" offset="13523368">The conduct that's... that's the core of the violation is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.308" offset="13540818">It's an Executive Branch decision to use funds in a way that's impermissible under the establishment clause, and we've been drawing the lines that the Government has been trying to draw just makes no sense, and to leave out, to insulate from any taxpayer challenge really huge swaths of conduct that is really at the very core of what Madison was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.050" offset="13619813">So our submission is that that really makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.142" offset="13640188">There's no basis in history, for example, for the Government's claim that Executive Branch decisions are somehow different and insulated with respect to spending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.326" offset="13676864">It's the spending of the same threepence, and if history indicates anything it's that concerns about establishment were focused just as much on the King as on the Parliament in terms of the history that the framers understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.713" offset="13726497">And for the idea that the executive would be given free rein to exercise discretion with respect to spending and there would be no concern about the types of injuries that gave rise to Flast we think is just not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.112" offset="13779995">If the Court has no further questions, thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3413.203" offset="13812387">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.000" offset="13819597">Just a few points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.092" offset="13823986">First of all, I think it's important to emphasize that if this Court recognizes that there is not taxpayer standing, that does not mean that there won't be lawsuits, that there won't be directly injured plaintiffs that can bring claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.666" offset="13870275">Doremus and Schemp prove that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.869" offset="13879052">But even more broadly, any time the establishment clause injury takes the form of alleged coercive conduct the individuals who are coerced Are going to have standing to bring the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.974" offset="13919489">The second point to make clear is it's just not an accurate description of this Court's cases to say that the spending of appropriated funds by the executive is enough to give rise to taxpayer standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.672" offset="13962330">The property distribution plan at issue in Valley Forge took a tremendous amount of appropriated funds to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.184" offset="13988348">Nobody thought that was a basis for taxpayer standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.308" offset="14000782">The Bibles that were purchased and the salaries of the teachers in Doremus presumably cost at least a threepence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.822" offset="14026905">But that was not found enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.994" offset="14035577">Now, I think in trying to understand the Court's cases you really have to focus on this word "incidental".</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.163" offset="14056266">And I think that the colloquy in the second half of the argument shows that you can't look at incidental as being minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.739" offset="14082598">It doesn't mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.488" offset="14085524">It doesn't mean minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.472" offset="14089494">It doesn't mean incremental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.754" offset="14094614">It is trying to distinguish an incidental expenditure of funds when... as to something where the expenditure of funds is central or vital to the establishment clause violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.592" offset="14134007">In the context of money going to third party religious entities, nobody would say that the spending is incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.355" offset="14156995">It's the whole violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.542" offset="14161801">In the context of Bible reading or anything else the Executive Branch does, the fact that money went to fund the Executive Branch to violate the establishment clause is the least of the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.226" offset="14200462">The problem is the primary conduct of the Executive Branch in violating the establishment clause, but that's not a spending injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.129" offset="14224077">The funding that goes into that is incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.378" offset="14237138">I think that's the way to make sense of this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.409" offset="14249259">It's important to emphasize what's at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.393" offset="14257200">It's not a general challenge to the Faith-Based Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.219" offset="14268485">It's not a challenge to the name of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.202" offset="14276426">It is a challenge to the particular offices and the assertion that the Executive Branch officials at the conferences spent too much time talking about faith-based groups and not enough talking about community-based groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.385" offset="14325119">If that isn't intrusive on the Executive Branch, I don't know what is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.524" offset="14337657">The last point I would leave you with is that if something has to go in this area, if you have to choose between the logic of Flast and the irreducible minimum requirements of Article III, I think it's an easy choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.613" offset="14390007">You don't abandon the basic requirements of Article III that distinguish the Judiciary from the political branches of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.393" offset="14413204">I think the Seventh Circuit, with all due respect, lost sight of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.282" offset="14424697">Its decision should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.923" offset="14431280">Thank you.</text>
