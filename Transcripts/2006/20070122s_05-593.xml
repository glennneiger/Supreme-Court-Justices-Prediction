            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90088">Second case I have to announce is Osborn v. Haley, No. 05-593.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.339" offset="123420">In the Westfall Act Congress accorded federal employees absolute immunity from Tort Claims arising out of acts undertaken in the performance of their official duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.728" offset="180994">The act authorizes the Attorney General to certify that a federal employee sued for a wrongful conduct was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.020" offset="246091">When the Attorney General so certified the United States has substituted as defendant in place of the employee if the action comments in the State Court the Westfall Act calls for its removal to a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.283" offset="315159">The key importance the act renders the Attorney General’s certification conclusive for purposes of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.849" offset="349432">We address in this case procedural and substitute questions regarding the Westfall Act operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.683" offset="384749">Plaintiff petition of Pat Osborn sued federal employee Barry Haley in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.285" offset="411185">Osborn alleged that Haley tortiously interfered with her employment with a private contractor that he conspired to cause how wrongful discharge and that his efforts to bring about her discharge were outside the scope of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.829" offset="481402">The U.S. Attorney serving the Attorney General’s delegate certified that Haley was acting within this scope of his employment at the time of the misconduct alleged in Osborn’s complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.749" offset="536991">The U.S. Attorney thereupon remove the case to a federal District Court where she asserted that although Osborn and Haley encountered each other in a work setting the alleged wrongdoing by Haley simply did not happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.014" offset="602088">Federal Court has divided on the question whether Westfall Act certification is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.835" offset="625389">When the federal employee asserts and the Attorney General concludes that the harm causing incident alleged by the plaintiff never occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.476" offset="663946">The District Court in the instant case held the certification improper when the employee and the Attorney General deny the occurrence of the incident or episode on which the plaintiff claim raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.165" offset="730715">Accordingly, the District Court entered an order that rejected the Westfall Act certification denied the government’s motion to substitute the United States as defendant in place of Haley and remanded the case to the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.583" offset="792364">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit determine that Westfall Act certification was proper so the government denied the alleged wrongdoing and therefore vacated the District Court’s order.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.170" offset="846699">We affirm the Court of Appeals judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.138" offset="858610">We considered first whether the Sixth Circuit has jurisdiction to review the District Court’s remand order not withstanding 28 U.S.C. 1447(d) which states that in order remanding a case to the State Court in which the action originated is not reviewable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.804" offset="945232">We hold that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction the Westfall Act provision rendering the Attorney General’s certification conclusive of purposes of removal is designed to prevent the needless shuttling of case forth and back from one court to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.743" offset="1013046">Section 1447(d) is also designed to prevent fro and to movement of cases between courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.189" offset="1054842">But only one of the two anti-shuttling provisions can prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.242" offset="1075009">Provisions detailed in the opinion court’s opinion, we conclude that the provision tailor made for Westfall Act cases controls under that provision once a Tort action comments in state court against the federal officer has been removed to a Federal Court pursuant to certification by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.743" offset="1173020">The case must they put in the Federal Court and may not be remanded to the state system.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.910" offset="1205726">On the merits we agree with the Sixth Circuit the Westfall Act certification is proper when the Attorney General concludes that in true, the incident or episode in sue never occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.546" offset="1260269">The United States, we hold must remain the federal defendant in this action unless and until the District Court determines that Haley in fact and not simply has alleged in Osborn complaint engaged in conduct beyond the scope of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.681" offset="1336756">Justice Souter has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part as has Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.533" offset="1364132">Justice Scalia has filed the dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
