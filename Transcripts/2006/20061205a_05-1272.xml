            <text syncTime="11.684" offset="201078">The Tenth Circuit in this case correctly held that Stone could not share in the award given by the jury unless he was an original source of pondcrete allegations.</text>

            <text syncTime="38.640" offset="308911">It seems to me that if he was not an original source, not only shouldn't he get any money, but neither should the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="57.165" offset="382995">I think the way that the courts have handled it below is that it says that there's no jurisdiction unless it is a claim brought by a relator who is an original source or if it's brought by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.284" offset="431478">And if the relator drops out, I think courts deem it to at that point be viewed as a claim brought by the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.012" offset="502322">Well, it can't be, Your Honor, because under the statutory terms, under section 3720(a) the Attorney General has the authority to bring a claim on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.367" offset="547775">There is no authority for the United States to bring a claim on behalf of the relator.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.630" offset="572853">Instead there is a second type of claim under section 3730, and that's a section (b), which authorizes a relator to bring a claim on behalf of himself and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.405" offset="627919">Similarly, Your Honor, if you look at the provisions in section (d), which authorize an award to a relator, it requires that the action be one brought under section (b), that is in other words it be an action brought by the relator which the United States then proceeds on for (d)(1).</text>

            <text syncTime="147.690" offset="745052">Well, I don't think it can be, Your Honor, because if you look at the language throughout these sections, it differentiates between two kinds of actions, actions brought by the United States or the Attorney General and actions brought by the relator.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.576" offset="800640">And it is only an action brought by the relator under section (b) that authorizes an award under section (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="169.947" offset="834077">And it consistently talks about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.679" offset="852990">It says under 3, what is it, (c)(3) I guess, if the elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.721" offset="909205">Now, that suggests that if the Government intervenes the Government is proceeding with the action, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="198.544" offset="948493">If you look at, if you look at the language in section (d), for instance, it says if the government proceeds with an action brought by a person under section, subsection (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="207.916" offset="986005">In other words, it has to be an action under subsection (b) in order to authorize an award at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.617" offset="1012755">The Government has... has authority under subsection (a) to bring an action, but it has no authority to bring it on behalf of the relator.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.254" offset="1043370">The statute consistently uses these same terms, and this Court in Graham County, which was a decision dealing with the statute of limitations, actually described this section in the same way, saying that there are two kinds of actions, those that are brought by the Attorney General under subsection (a) and those that are brought by a relator under subsection (b), which the United States can then proceed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.899" offset="1149950">What the relator is really arguing here is that if you look at the... at subsection (e)(4), they're adding a phrase that's not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.208" offset="1195194">They're saying that there's no jurisdiction over an action under this section if it is brought by the Attorney General or brought by a relator who is an original source or the United States intervenes and proceeds with the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.217" offset="1267187">And that's not in here.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.567" offset="1360601">That's a very, very expansive notion of what "brought by the United States" means.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.799" offset="1381499">What I'm saying is or, to put it another way, if you take your picky-picky notion of being brought by the United States, to be logical about it you must reach the conclusion that if you defeat the private plaintiff under... under he's not original source, the whole thing is thrown out, not just his recovery but the Government's recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.363" offset="1523814">--Well, we don't argue for that because I think that the Court has said that the Government's intervention does not cure defects with respect to the relator, and therefore, if the relator didn't have... that... doesn't have standing... you know, part of this goes to the issue of the Stevens assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.792" offset="1605525">If they don't have an assignment, then they don't even have standing to be in the action, they have no right to recover.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.900" offset="1777933">But again, if the rule is that they lose as well, then so be it.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.319" offset="1795592">The fact is this statute uses the term that is used in section (a), which is "brought by the United States".</text>
            <text syncTime="416.474" offset="1820252">And it makes perfect sense because otherwise think of what the consequences are if the relator can simply copy an indictment, file a complaint, and say... and the Government intervenes because it's a major action, and then they say, aha, you're stuck with me because you've intervened and now there's jurisdiction and there's no problem, I don't have to be an original source.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.233" offset="2031217">So this is not just an issue between the United States and Stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.044" offset="2050547">The statute controls the award of fees based upon whether he's entitled to a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.245" offset="2067266">So even if this weren't an issue of jurisdiction, if he's not entitled to a share under a section (d)(1), then he's also not entitled to attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.163" offset="2110942">And therefore, we would win.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.443" offset="2120138">He would still need to... whether it's a jurisdictional rule or a substantive rule, if he's not an original source he's out.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.692" offset="2145111">But the share is not the only issue that makes the Government's... or that makes Stone's argument implausible here.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.781" offset="2177398">That is that once the relator is in the action, the United States can't get them out of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.513" offset="2200386">Even if they don't have to pay them money, under subsection (c) they have a whole range of rights to participate in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.792" offset="2229538">They can't dismiss the relator.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.041" offset="2238524">So it makes no sense to read this statute to say that someone who copies an indictment, files a complaint, the Government intervenes, they're in there forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.052" offset="2278544">It instead makes much more sense to read the terms the way they're used elsewhere in the statute, to mean that there is only jurisdiction if it is a section--</text>
            <text syncTime="542.643" offset="2324938">(a) claim brought by the United States on behalf of itself or if it is a section b) claim by a relator that is an original source.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.933" offset="2366002">That's what makes sense of the statute as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.448" offset="2376138">If I could turn to the issue of whether or not the Tenth Circuit correctly held that Stone had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which his allegations were based.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.412" offset="2427964">It bears emphasis that every act that he had to prove in order to recover on the pondcrete allegations... whether they're measured at the beginning of the case or the end of the case doesn't matter... every single act occurred after he left the plaintiff, after he had left his job.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.696" offset="3021153">He does not say that there were pondcrete violations before then and indeed there were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.100" offset="3038707">The reason there weren't is because when he was at the plant Rockwell was producing hard pondcrete, hard pondcrete, and it wasn't storing it on site, it was shipping it to Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.845" offset="3085728">So he couldn't... and it wasn't even clear that it was subject to RCRA because DOE didn't enter into a RCRA compliance agreement until after he left.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.623" offset="3124807">He also concedes in his deposition that he was not, except with one exception... he was not aware of any time when Rockwell affirmatively represented that it was in compliance with environmental safety and health provisions when it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.225" offset="3191262">That's JA-106.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.709" offset="3197114">So he didn't... unlike your hypothetical, he didn't know anything about there being a pondcrete fraud prior to the time of his departure and doesn't even allege one.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.971" offset="3242253">Instead, what the Tenth Circuit rested upon was the fact that he had reviewed a design for making pondcrete 5 years... in fact, not for making pondcrete; it was actually a design for removing sludge from the ponds... 5 years before any of the events at issue here, and he said he predicted there would be a design problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.673" offset="4021016">Much like... I think the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is a perfect example because it too talks about jurisdiction being predicated on, for instance, commercial... claims that are based upon commercial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.684" offset="4073052">Suppose that the plaintiff at the outset of the case when the 12(b)(1) motion is filed posits one theory of the case that involves a predicate commercial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.978" offset="4114221">But when it gets to trial he's abandoned that theory and now he doesn't have any commercial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.522" offset="4136373">Surely the Court would say you have to satisfy jurisdiction over the theory that has actually gone to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.482" offset="4220278">But here again, if we just look at the very beginning of the case, he does identify in those interrogatory responses, for instance, what the factual basis for the pondcrete allegations are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.404" offset="6523964">The Court should affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals because as the Government recognizes, Mr. Stone is an original source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.262" offset="6551341">And it is important to the look at the statute and its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.730" offset="6565238">The original source provision is intended to determine who may bring a claim on behalf of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.053" offset="6594495">And the recovery provision, 3730(d)(1), determines how much if anything a relator may share in the Government's recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.269" offset="6635351">In this case, whether where the Government fully supports the relator, I would submit that the interests of the statute and the interests of the United States are fully satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.170" offset="6670982">And that is because Mr. Stone is the paradigm not parasitic relator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.512" offset="6692402">He had knowledge firsthand from his six years at Rockwell of a pattern, Justice Kennedy, a pattern of criminal conduct and a pattern of Rockwell concealing that information.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.763" offset="6837329">Mr. Stone in his affidavit at 179 in the joint appendix and also in his disclosure statement, which is at 29...

            <text syncTime="1705.468" offset="6976196">He said that in the very beginning of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.702" offset="6985078">And at trial, what the testimony was... and I would direct the Court to Mr. Freibach's testimony at joint appendix 522, as well as at the trial transcript at 987, the issue there was the variability of the sludge which may have caused greater inspections and may have required additional cement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.427" offset="7075984">And what is very important is even Mr. Freibach who is the first foreman, on whom petitioners rely, he testified that during his tenure, the variation of the sludge required between 200 and 350 pounds of cement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.939" offset="9466084">Mr. Chief Justice, there is a split in the circuits on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.858" offset="9481757">The issue was not decided by the Court of Appeals and as I understand even Rockwell's position, that is not Rockwell's position, that Rockwell's position is like our position, that it's information in the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.727" offset="9541212">But I would submit that that would make no difference in this case because Mr. Stone's knowledge is direct and independent of the information in his complaint as well as the information in the public disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.536" offset="9588441">And what is important is that Rockwell is asking this Court to adopt the quick trigger that the Court of Appeals adopted because that was the Tenth Circuit's law on public disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.048" offset="9626475">Yet in this case, say that Mr. Stone's direct and independent knowledge has to be very, very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.060" offset="9646538">It has to be of the particular false statements, and that would eviscerate the entire original source rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.308" offset="9671511">And if I could just get to the point of the jurisdictional issue and why Rockwell's position as to the trial evidence is wrong, it's wrong for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.304" offset="9707560">The first is that the statute speaks in terms of allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.975" offset="9722188">It does not speak in terms of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.740" offset="9729293">In fact, in the provision E. 2, which is a provision regarding bringing claims against members of the judiciary and members of Congress, Congress said information or evidence, but in this provision E. 4, Congress only said information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.826" offset="9801600">So looking at the trial evidence would be wrong by virtue of the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.590" offset="9820722">It also would be wrong as, Mr. Chief Justice, you pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.932" offset="9838067">Since 1824, I believe this Court has held that jurisdiction is determined at the time of commencement as of the state of things at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.210" offset="9867115">And as, Justice Ginsburg, you pointed out, it would be an inappropriate rule to say that if the government decides to refine the allegation, after all, it is still a concrete allegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.787" offset="10045480">We're not talking about the Federal question jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.207" offset="10059168">But in this provision, just like in the Clean Water Act in the Walton case, the statute uses the word allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.345" offset="10087693">As in that case, the statute used the word alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.499" offset="10100337">And the Court held very clearly that you look at it as of commencement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.436" offset="10112040">Now it might be a different case if we had a federal question case and the relator or the plaintiff withdrew the Federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.730" offset="10141192">Then there would be a loss of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.244" offset="10147253">Here of course, the amended complaint satisfied jurisdiction when the government adopted the relator's claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2507.803" offset="10185496">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.376" offset="10239831">One of the features of this case that may appear anomalous is the fact that the government is aligned with Stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.108" offset="10262714">That is, it's Rockwell's position that the entire recovery in this case should go to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.107" offset="10278701">It is Stone's position that the recovery should be shared with the relator, and the government agrees with Stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.041" offset="10302524">It might be natural for the Court to wonder, why would it be in the government's interest to advocate that a share of the money damages in this case should be given to a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.162" offset="10338991">And the reason is that the government believes that there are three systemic government interests that are implicated by this case and that would be endangered if Rockwell's position prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.956" offset="10378175">First, in our view, Stone is precisely the type of relator that Congress intended to encourage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.156" offset="10402939">Stone was somebody who had substantial firsthand knowledge of Rockwell's environmental practices and of its billing practices, and moreover, Stone was somebody who didn't conceal his information from the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.010" offset="10450378">Well, that's all very nice, but Congress didn't leave it up to you to decide who ought to get rewarded or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.586" offset="10476709">It laid down some textual conditions in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.162" offset="10490920">And unless they are complied with, the fact that you think this is the kind of person you think ought to get the money is really totally irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2592.144" offset="10522893">And as to Stone's original complaint, the statute frames the inquiry as whether Stone has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations were based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.640" offset="10564898">And we agree with Rockwell and with Stone that that refers to the allegations in his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.372" offset="10583811">Now the allegations were fairly generalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.949" offset="10594155">They didn't refer specifically to pondcrete, and they covered a wide range of time, from 1980 through to the present, which was 1989 as of the filing of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.867" offset="10633757">Stone subsequently submitted a lengthy affidavit in which he explained what led him to the conclusion that Rockwell was engaged in a systematic practice of violating the environmental laws and misrepresenting the nature of its compliance to the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2752.141" offset="11162893">For purposes of proving those allegations, it was not necessary for the Government to offer any hypothesis as to why the pondcrete failed.</text>

I mean, I'm sorry, that Stone and the United States intended to prove at trial, and by far the predominant focus is on the fact of pondcrete failures and Rockwell's awareness that they had... that pondcrete had failed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.869" offset="14365819">--Your Honor, the point is that Mr. Stone wasn't there when the manufacturing problems occurred, so he didn't actually have direct knowledge that pondcrete was leaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.162" offset="14398942">That's the real point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.241" offset="14403331">What they're really saying is that his theory about why it might leak some day didn't turn out to be important to the gravamen of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.658" offset="14436977">This is a fraud claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.580" offset="14440634">He didn't know anything about fraud and he couldn't have known they were leaking at the time, 5 years later because he wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.280" offset="14475429">And the statute requires direct knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.341" offset="14487654">The Government's suggestion that somehow Rule 11 will be the basis on which we can sort out who's an original source and who's not strikes me as rather odd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.836" offset="14533630">First of all, nothing hardly ever gets dismissed on Rule 11 grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.195" offset="14547109">And this is a jurisdictional statute that requires direct knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.475" offset="14564245">A relator could read an indictment and satisfy Rule 10 just by copying the allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.283" offset="14595488">Does that count?</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.485" offset="14600294">I think that direct knowledge means there can't be undue conjecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.312" offset="14619520">The only thing that he said he knew, even though it wasn't the gravamen of the claim, was clearly based upon conjecture, a belief that in his opinion this pipe would not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.730" offset="14665287">And then when we get to the trial, there were 55 witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.649" offset="14688902">Stone had not identified a single one of them as a person with relevant knowledge at the outset of the case when he answered his interrogatory responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.740" offset="14717323">In addition, every person... no person he identified testified at the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.019" offset="14738430">He identified four documents that he said were key.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.705" offset="14753163">None of them were introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.297" offset="14763507">He knew nothing about what went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.890" offset="14773852">In addition, I'd like to focus on the "voluntarily provide".</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.279" offset="14791406">That is a separate ground for reversal in this case, and would emphasize that the Tenth Circuit said the engineering order that refers to removal of sludge and says in my opinion this won't work, that's all it says... the Tenth Circuit says that's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.475" offset="14864235">The district court made a factual finding that Stone had not communicated his concerns to the Government about pondcrete, saltcrete, or spray irrigation, the three theories issues at issue at trial here.</text>
