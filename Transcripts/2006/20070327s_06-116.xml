            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="10.945" offset="133639">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.126" offset="154432">The Guam legislature authorized respondent, the governor of Guam to issue bonds to fund the territory’s continuing obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.768" offset="192989">Petitioner Guam’s Attorney General refused to sign the contracts necessary to issue the bonds because he believed the bonds would violate the debt-limitation provision in Guam’s Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.611" offset="252339">Respondent sought a declaration in the Guam Supreme Court that the bond issue would not violate the organic facts debt-limitation and the Guam Supreme Court agreed reasoning that Guam’s debt limit had to be calculated by using the appraised value of property in Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.411" offset="339588">Petitioner initially sought review in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit but after Congress removed the Ninth Circuit’s jurisdiction over appeals from the courts of Guam, the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.827" offset="409178">Petitioner then filed a petition for certiorari in this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.162" offset="430599">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today we reverse the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.059" offset="458184">We hold that the petition for certiorari in this court was timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.820" offset="477201">Certiorari petitions must be filed within 90 days of the entry of judgment in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.775" offset="504995">Although petitioner filed the petition more than 90 days after the Guam’s Supreme Court’s judgment dependency of theappeal before the Court of Appeals suspended the finality of that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.500" offset="559957">By agreeing to hear petitioner’s appeal, the Court of Appeals raised the possibility that it might modify the judgment or alter the party’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.292" offset="603111">Accordingly, the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court did not become final for purposes of this court’s review until the Court of Appeals dismiss the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.260" offset="646997">As to the merits, Guam’s Organic Act limits the territories allow debt to 10% of the aggregate tax valuation of property in the Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.771" offset="701018">The Guam Supreme Court held that the term “tax valuation” in the Organic Act refers to “appraised valuation” not assessed valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.655" offset="748561">The tax valuation most naturally means the “value to which the tax rate is applied” tax valuation must therefore mean “assess valuation” which is then defined as the “valuation of property for purposes of taxation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="182.869" offset="821391">One would not normally refer to a property’s appraised valuation as its tax valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.519" offset="852006">Appraised valuation is simply market value which may or may not relate to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.690" offset="876666">It is true that Congress could have made its intent clear or even clearer by using the term assess valuation as it did in the debt-limitation provisions for the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.328" offset="931209">But if Congress had intended to refer to actual market or appraised value it could have used any of those terms as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.964" offset="969766">We therefore hold that Guam’s debt limit must be calculated using assess valuation not appraised valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.807" offset="1005188">Justice Souter has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Alito join.</text>
