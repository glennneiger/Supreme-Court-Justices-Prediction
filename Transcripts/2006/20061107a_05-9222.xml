            <text syncTime="7.622" offset="181056">In Sharp versus Pain, the Ninth Circuit opinion that first decided the question that's before you today, the Ninth Circuit said, and I'm quoting:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.245" offset="211567">"The rule of Blakely that the statutory maximum is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict, was not clear until the Blakely decision itself. "</text>
            <text syncTime="26.444" offset="256393">The Ninth Circuit is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.723" offset="265483">In this Court's Apprendi decision it laid down precisely that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.174" offset="279276">At page 483 of that decision this Court described the statutory maximum concept as, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="37.923" offset="302264">"the maximum a defendant would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone. "</text>

            <text syncTime="44.873" offset="330058">Mr. Fisher, you know, assuming we read it the way you read it, I've got a basic problem that doesn't really surface until you get to the end of the briefs and I wonder if you would comment on it at the beginning of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.774" offset="385647">That is... or I'll put it in the form of a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.444" offset="400380">Is the decision which the judge makes here to sentence consecutively rather than concurrently, a decision that requires the finding of any fact about the commission of the crimes themselves or the circumstances of those crimes or about the defendant's character?</text>
            <text syncTime="87.919" offset="502257">Does the judge have to make or does the fact... some fact finder have to make a finding on any of those subjects... crimes, circumstances, character of the defendant?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="101.398" offset="556174">What is that fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="101.882" offset="558159">It's precisely the same kind of fact that the judge had to find in Blakely itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.409" offset="576236">Under the Washington, Revised Code of Washington, the statute, the statute for running sentences consecutively in the fashion that Mr. Burton's were run consecutively, refers the judge back to the very same provision that was at issue in Blakely itself, which is the aggravating factors provision of Washington, which was formerly codified at section 390 and is now codified at section--</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="128.245" offset="663589">I thought the only fact that had to be found was that, given the classification sentencing scheme Washington had, there would be, in effect, a free crime, no incremental punishment, unless there were consecutive sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.238" offset="739553">That's not a fact that falls within any of those categories of crime, character, or circumstances.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="152.720" offset="761496">That would be a fact, Justice Souter, but that is not the way the Washington law works.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.233" offset="779573">It is colloquially known as the free crime aggravator.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.966" offset="794411">But in the Washington Supreme Court decision in Hughes which is cited at the end of our reply brief the Washington Supreme Court made clear that to invoke that aggravator a court has to find that there was extraordinarily serious culpability or extraordinarily serious harm that accompanies the multiple offenses.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="177.741" offset="861598">So it's a misnomer to say it's a mere free crime criterion?</text>
            <text syncTime="182.693" offset="881346">It's free crime plus some further fact?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="185.722" offset="893467">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.252" offset="895557">And this Court's decision... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.643" offset="901199">The Washington Supreme Court decision in Hughes clearly lays that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.298" offset="915828">If you have any doubt about the way the consecutive sentences work in Washington, I want to give you one other citation, to a new Washington Court of Appeals decision that considers a consecutive sentences imposed exactly the same way that Mr. Burton's was.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.027" offset="966714">That is to say, they are run consecutively based on the clearly too lenient factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.072" offset="986881">That case is called State versus Washington and it was just reported at 143 P. 3d 606, 143 P. 3d 606.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.506" offset="1020631">The Washington Court of Appeals in that case, considering a sentence just like Mr. Burton's, says that it does trigger and violate Blakely.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="224.721" offset="1049470">So the extra fact then is a lot like the sort of heinous, atrocious and cruel aggravator?</text>
            <text syncTime="231.328" offset="1075906">I mean, it's comparable to it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="233.484" offset="1084579">Exactly, it's part of the same list.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.858" offset="1090012">And as this Court said in Apprendi itself, that extra culpability, which is one of the ways this aggravator can be met, is the quintessential type of element that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="246.385" stopTime="283.511">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="246.385" offset="1136092">When you say extra culpability, do you mean the nature of the crime?</text>
            <text syncTime="250.931" offset="1154273">Suppose there are three crimes all committed at the same time... murder, rape, and kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.584" offset="1184889">They're all very serious crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.848" offset="1193980">And if you sentence them consecutively, you will take into account that there were three.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.689" offset="1217385">If you sentence them concurrently, it doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.703" offset="1229402">The Washington court says, we're not just looking to the fact that murder or rape or kidnapping are serious; we're looking to sentence consecutively if do you more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.231" offset="1267540">You have to look to see that the kidnapping was a special kind of kidnapping.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="283.511" offset="1284677">That's right, Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.620" offset="1293036">In section... the current section is section 589 of the Washington Code and it says that sentences shall run concurrently unless the judge makes an extra finding of exactly the same type the judge is required to find in Blakely.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.005" offset="1346639">And if you look at Blakely itself, remember Blakely involved concurrent sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.003" offset="1362626">And so what Washington is doing is saying all sentences should run concurrently unless there's an extra fact, something about the additional crimes that would otherwise be running concurrently, that simply requires the judge to go above and beyond the ordinary concurrent sentences and punish those crimes separately.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="319.028" stopTime="345.891">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="319.028" offset="1426678">But could the nature of the additional crimes themselves satisfy it?</text>
            <text syncTime="323.292" offset="1443815">In other words, could the judge say, well, all three... it might be one thing if one were serious and the other two were trivial, but all of these three are very serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.224" offset="1487491">Now, that's in effect a value judgment, not a finding of discrete fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.255" offset="1503583">Could that value judgment satisfy the extraordinary criterion that Washington says there must be in addition to free crime.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="345.891" offset="1534198">No, it couldn't, and the Washington decision that I've cited to you will help you with this, because it makes it clear that to trigger an aggravator to run sentences concurrently, just as under Blakely itself, there has to be something above and beyond the elements of the crime or the crimes themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.136" offset="1595116">It can't simply be... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.479" offset="1604520">It can't simply be that there were three crimes committed and all three of them are very serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.227" offset="1623537">It has to be something about the crime, the additional crimes, that takes it above and beyond the ordinary commission of that crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.956" offset="1686440">In this particular case, there was... it was necessary to make an additional finding of fact, even though there may be cases out there in which you could get consecutive sentences without an additional finding of fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="396.230" offset="1735550">You're certainly right that in this case you needed to have an extra finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.698" offset="1753418">There are some situations under the Washington Code and I believe in the majority of other States where it is up to the judge's discretion whether to run sentences concurrently, and he could do it for the reason that Justice Souter described.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.724" offset="1801483">So what Washington does in its respondent's brief is it cites these other State decisions, from other States that simply have different sentencing systems than we have in Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.202" offset="2171377">You haven't had a case in the Apprendi-Blakely line of cases dealing with consecutive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.576" offset="2188931">But what you've done is laid down a rule from the very State that we're dealing with here that says that if the judge needs to make an extra finding beyond the elements of the crimes of conviction and beyond the facts encompassed in the jury's finding of guilt for those crimes, then those findings need to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.224" offset="2259462">That's why in this case that line, that rule, is triggered.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.474" offset="2276494">The Ninth Circuit of course didn't talk about any of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.209" offset="2287465">What it said, as I mentioned, is that it simply took Apprendi to be a purely formalistic rule that had nothing to do with the facts according to the jury verdict, but it just had to do with whatever the State happened to label as the statutory maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.140" offset="2339188">In Apprendi this Court said, not once but three times, that the statutory maximum concept was triggered according to the facts encompassed in the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.402" offset="2376177">And like the Washington courts, the Ninth Circuit simply ignored that language in this Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.009" offset="2394672">Lest there be any doubt about the way that concept mapped onto this case, this Court said in Apprendi itself that the relevant inquiry was not one of form but one of effect: Does the required finding take a defendant to a higher sentence level than would otherwise be permissible based on the facts encompassed in the jury verdict?</text>

            <text syncTime="728.223" offset="3063511">You can't retroactively change that challenge to the 1994 judgment into one against the 1998 judgment, for two reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.422" offset="4184269">And even if you did that it becomes, we submit, very clear that a district judge, any reasonable trial judge, that is, would have known that Apprendi applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.106" offset="4223034">What you had in New Jersey was essentially two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.869" offset="4238081">One that said an ordinary commission of a crime is punishable up to 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.040" offset="4254799">And a second statute that said if you commit that crime with some kind of extra... extra bad circumstance, there a hate crime, then you get... you can get a higher sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1058.260" offset="4383635">And the analogy that the respondents want to draw between the Washington sentencing system and the Federal guidelines just simply doesn't hold up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.255" offset="4443612">Because in Blakely all you needed to do was apply Apprendi which said that if you have two different statutory thresholds, the pertinent threshold for Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is the one that cabins the judge's discretion based on the facts in the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.343" offset="4507978">To decide Booker this Court had to take the term statutory maximum and apply that to a different type of threshold, which was as this Court put it a court rule or a quasi legislative enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.650" offset="4561163">So under... under the system that this Court reviewed in Booker, you had only a single true statutory maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.614" offset="4593033">And then you had to decide whether the Apprendi principle ought to be in play for the Federal sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.832" offset="4613931">And if there is any confusion on that, a trial judge could have looked at Apprendi itself where this Court and Justice Thomas's concurrence made clear that there was unique status of the Federal sentencing guidelines that made it a more difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.591" offset="4664922">However, here where you didn't have anything like that, we had just a simple situation where there were two statutes, one maximum for the ordinary crime, and then an additional maximum for the crime being committed with aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.586" offset="4720928">And so it was a very clear map line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.742" offset="4729601">And that's what this Court said in Blakely, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.897" offset="4738169">It said, it didn't break any new ground in the decision in Blakely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.880" offset="4754156">It simply said that, took the state's argument and rejected it by saying our precedents on this point are clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.384" offset="4856138">And I think, if we want to talk about these, it is important first to be clear about what we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.414" offset="4876305">There were, there was a Supreme Court of Kansas that had looked to the relevant language in Apprendi and decided that its sentencing guidelines system could not stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.239" offset="4907547">And then you had, on the other side the Supreme Court of Washington, and the Supreme Court of Oregon, and a couple of other State intermediate courts, I think some in unpublished decisions, that had gone the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.500" offset="4948611">But I think it is very telling, Justice Ginsburg, if you want to look at those State supreme... I'm sorry, those State supreme court and lower court decisions, because none of them... not a single one... quotes Apprendi or even acknowledges the passages in Apprendi that said the test is not one of form but of effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.479" offset="5012559">And there's several passages in Apprendi that said that the statutory maximum was the maximum allowed based on the facts in the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.037" offset="5042757">So once you take those into account, we submit, as the Kansas Supreme Court realized, there is only one conclusion that you can reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.816" offset="5065849">The only way those lower courts were able to come to a contrary decision was simply to pluck out... pluck out other sentences of Apprendi and not acknowledge the rest of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.610" offset="5109003">And of course, the rest of the opinion where this Court has these passages, pages 483, 482, are the absolute guts, the building blocks of the opinion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.073" offset="5150904">It is where the Court canvasses the historical rule that was incorporated into our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.446" offset="5172429">And so it is not as though that is some sort of dicta that or loose language that this Court had in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.180" offset="5191341">It was the very guts of the holding of Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.710" offset="5205447">And we submit that, in a Teague analysis where you are indeed supposed to look to whether a reasonable jurist would have found something, not just the fact that they exist, but whether a reasonable jurist would have reached a given conclusion, once you take the whole of Apprendi into account, there was only one conclusion that a reasonable jurist could have come to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.542" offset="5456745">But if it has a new application, that's... that's new.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.071" offset="5486838">I think the Stringer test is helpful because there, of course, this Court said that one of its prior decisions was not a new rule, because even though there was a different State sentencing system that slightly different before the Court in the subsequent case, the principle from the prior case dictated only one result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.189" offset="5547338">And I think once you go back to the dissents in Blakely and compare them let's say, with the dissents in Booker, on the merits that is, in Booker, I think again it is telling, because the dissenters in Blakely had nothing to say in terms of a possible way to distinguish one case from the other; whereas in Booker, the dissents did point out we don't have to extend it this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.869" offset="5630094">We can limit to it to true statutes and not go this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.101" offset="5643051">So there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.882" offset="5650156">Really what this case, I think one way to phrase it in terms of what it comes down to, is whether when this Court lays a decision down like Apprendi, that has a clear rule and lots of historical, robust reasoning behind it, saying why we are adopting a certain rule, whether it is up to the lower courts, in this case the State courts, to second-guess this Court and say I don't know if the Court really means what it says, as Justice Breyer later put it in the Blakely dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.372" offset="5756109">We think that, we submit what this Court should say is that when we say something is the law, that lower courts ought to assume that's the law, at least until we tell them somehow that the law is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.819" offset="5801875">If there are no more questions on the new rule, I will quickly address the watershed argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.426" offset="5836252">Because if for some reason this Court adopted the state's view that really all Apprendi was was a highly formalistic rule about what is a statutory maximum, and that... and that just simply labeling, courts could have evaded it, we think that Blakely itself then has to be considered a watershed exception... a watershed rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.544" offset="5912739">And the reason why is because, is because of an error that runs throughout the state's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.495" offset="5936562">And the state's position is basically that this can't be watershed because Apprendi and Blakely deal with circumstances where a defendant has already been convicted of a crime and all we're considering is what sentence ought to be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.911" offset="5982225">But, of course, that... that contravenes the very holding of Apprendi and Blakely which is to remedy the fact that the defendant is being sentenced for a greater crime than the jury actually found him guilty of.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.877" offset="6166127">But as this case comes to the Court, as I understand it, this Court is considering this case in a posture that it really dealt with in Horn versus Banks where it said that even post AEDPA, what a court is supposed to do is conduct what this Court termed a threshold Teague inquiry as to whether Teague is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.449" offset="6236344">And of course in Horn, this Court mentioned the watershed exception itself.</text>

I think what we disagree about in this is which judgment, if the first petition went to the first... to the 1994 judgment, and the second petition went to the 1998 judgment, then we would agree with Mr. Fisher that it is not successive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.420" offset="6972265">On the other hand, I believe I heard him say that if you agree with us, that the only judgment in existence at the time he filed his petition was the 1998 judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.823" offset="7009882">Then he's filed a successive petition with regard to that judgment, one in December of 1998 dealing with the conviction; a second in 2002, dealing with the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.397" offset="10492213">And as you know, in Walton the jury would find somebody guilty of aggravated first degree murder, but they could not receive the death penalty unless the judge made additional findings in a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2712.533" offset="11000765">That is, in Apprendi if you wanted the aggravating factor if the judge found it by a preponderance then the sentence was enhanced.</text>

            <text syncTime="2769.556" offset="11228866">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.539" offset="11240778">If I could begin by addressing the issues that you were just talking about, there was a distinction that the Court could have drawn between Apprendi and Blakely and that reasonable jurists could have drawn and did draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.627" offset="11309114">One was the formal distinction that you were discussing before with the State, which was supported by Justice O'Connor's proposing that as an interpretation in her dissent and the majority not responding to that, that that distinction was contrary to the rule but implausible, but in fact accepting the... accepting that it was a plausible distinction and saying that it still wouldn't have made a difference, that the Apprendi rule still was important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.553" offset="11424785">The second... and in addition to that, that distinction that Justice O'Connor drew there was consistent with the Apprendi Court's distinction of Walton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.768" offset="11465640">And you have to look at what reasonable jurists could have interpreted looking at that decision at the time with those distinctions and what the Court said in Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.481" offset="11512556">But in addition to that, there was more than a formal distinction that could have been drawn between the system in Apprendi and the Washington guidelines system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.430" offset="11548291">That's the distinction that we proposed in our amicus brief in Blakely and it rested on the fact that sentencing guideline systems like Washington try to channel but not to eliminate the discretion that sentencing judges have to sentence within the otherwise applicable limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.314" offset="11623838">And in the Washington system the sentencing judge retained a significant degree of discretion that reasonable jurists could have analogized to traditional sentencing systems that aren't constrained by Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.026" offset="11678695">The facts, the facts on which the judge could rely to go above the guidelines, were not specified as in Apprendi and as in Ring by the legislature, but it was a wide open set that enabled the judge himself or herself to determine what facts the judge thought could justify a higher sentence; and in addition, the facts alone didn't trigger the higher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.548" offset="11780781">The judge had to look at those facts and make the additional determination that those facts rose to the level of substantial and compelling reasons that justified the higher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.606" offset="11817039">In that respect, the judge had a degree of sentencing discretion to decide what facts justified it and whether it was in fact justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.867" offset="11858104">Now, of course, this Court rejected those distinctions in Blakely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.476" offset="11876494">But the question is whether a reasonable jurist could have accepted those distinctions and drawn a difference, and we submit that they could have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.126" offset="11931142">We don't have a position on that precise, on that particular issue here, because it can't arise for Federal prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.122" offset="11963116">But let me explain why it can't arise for Federal prisoners because perhaps that will give the Court some guidance in resolving the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.338" offset="11991955">In the Federal system, it's well established that the conviction and the sentence are part of a unitary judgment and that that unitary judgment doesn't become final until the conviction and the sentence have both been fully adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.254" offset="12051619">That understanding is reflected in the language of 28 U.S.C. 2255, which is the statute that authorizes collateral attacks by Federal prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.015" offset="12098639">That statute authorizes attacks... what it authorizes is motions to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.714" offset="12129464">So it's clear from that that it's not authorizing collateral attacks on a conviction independent of the attendant sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.758" offset="12169588">And I think that could shed some guidance here, because 2255 was intended to be a parallel and substitute remedy to traditional habeas for Federal prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.926" offset="12218280">I would also make a point on the other sort of preliminary issues that were being discussed on the consecutive sentence issue, that it's not only the fact that the judge said that the multiple offense policy standing alone could justify the consecutive sentence here and that the court of appeals relied on that in upholding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.366" offset="12344086">But the court of appeals went further, because petitioner had made a separate challenge to... and this is on page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.519" offset="12380657">Petitioner made a separate challenge to the other two aggravating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.143" offset="12395181">Petitioner argued that the district court wasn't allowed to rely on... excuse me, the trial court couldn't rely on those two other aggravating factors because he had not relied on them in the original sentencing and this was a resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.653" offset="12449202">The court of appeals rejected that challenge and it rejected that challenge because it said the sentencing court concluded that the multiple offense policy alone justified the exceptional sentence, and then on page 53 it said:</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.488" offset="12540527">I'm mean, I'm sure you're reading correctly, but is that in fact true?</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.439" offset="12560380">Because, having talked, as I just read out a moment ago, having spoken about free crimes, aggravating factors, it says, on the basis of the foregoing facts I now draw the following conclusions of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.853" offset="12618058">--The trial court said each of the three standing alone was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.352" offset="12636030">But what the court of appeals said is these other two have been challenged, but these other two are... we're not going to deal with this challenge to these other two factors because they're out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.863" offset="12678035">So I think that this Court has to take the case as coming from... coming from the Washington courts as if what the courts essentially said is those other two are not in the case any more.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.719" offset="12725473">So we can treat it in effect... and this may be the way to do it... we can treat it as the ultimate sentencer was the Washington appellate court and that's what they said?</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew D. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="3153.276" offset="12763717">Well, what the Washington appellate court essentially, they could have said petitioner is right, those other two aggravating factors couldn't be relied on, and so we're relying on this the standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.787" offset="12805722">What they chose to do is, we're going to interpret what the trial court did as relying only on the one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.489" offset="12828605">And that was the basis for responding to that claim of error, and I do think that the Court has to take this case as coming on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.329" offset="12871864">If I could turn to the issue of Blakely retroactivity for a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.904" offset="12906241">In addition to the points that I made before about why Blakely was a new rule, I would also submit that Blakely is not a watershed rule because it's not a bedrock rule that's essential to a fair trial, and rules are only bedrock if they approach the fundamental and sweeping importance of Gideon, and Blakely doesn't have that kind of importance for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.690" offset="13009372">First, the right to counsel pervasively affects every aspect of the trial, but Blakely affects only the procedure for determining the punishment of defendants who have already been found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.466" offset="13060468">Second, a felony trial in which the defendant is denied counsel is inherently unfair, but it's not inherently unfair to use the preponderance standard to find facts that determine the extent of punishment, and in fact the Constitution permits the use of a preponderance standard to find many facts that have as much or more impact on punishment as facts covered by Blakely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.130" offset="13139149">Those include facts that trigger mandatory minimums, facts on which a judge relies to sentence within a broad statutory range, and even facts on which a judge relies to sentence above the standard range in advisory guideline systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.453" offset="13192438">Third, counsel is so essential to a fair trial that deprivation of the right can never be discounted as harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.435" offset="13216367">But this Court held in Recuenco that Blakely errors can be harmless, and in reaching that holding the Court expressly concluded that Blakely errors do not necessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.774" offset="13265686">That conclusion seems to strongly suggest that Blakely is not a bedrock rule essential to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.988" offset="13290554">If the Court has no further questions--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3290.503" offset="13312602">Thank you, counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.018" offset="13314691">Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="3293.782" offset="13325767">Let me say one word on jurisdiction and then turn to two comments on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.984" offset="13346561">On jurisdiction, I think Mr. Roberts is right that this rarely happens in the Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.843" offset="13365996">It rarely happens in the State system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.669" offset="13373310">We can't find any other case where a petitioner has gone in naming, as the State would say, in effect the wrong judgment and saying: "I'm challenging this judgment".</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.869" offset="13406120">But what happened here was just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.868" offset="13418032">Mr. Burton went in and said he was challenging the 1994 judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.850" offset="13430048">And under this Court's Castro decision, when a pro se petitioner comes in and says I'm doing one thing, in that case making a motion for a new trial, it can't be converted into something else which is a first habeas petition without advising the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.361" offset="13484069">And here, not only was he not advised by the trial court but the State in its own answer, which we attached to our reply brief, agreed that he could challenge the 1994 conviction, and said that conviction is final, and he can challenge that judgment, the 1994 judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.246" offset="13539553">So it's way too late in the day for the State to stand up to you now and say this pro se petitioner should bear the burden of bringing an improper petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.884" offset="13578110">On the merits, I don't want to elaborate beyond simply just telling this Court that if you look at the Hughes decision and you look at the Washington decision from the Washington state courts, it is clear that an extra finding was necessary here, even if the only aggravator in play is the free crimes are clearly too lenient factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.359" offset="13656060">Hughes makes it crystal clear that a judge needs to find, and I'm quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.342" offset="13667971">"extraordinarily serious harm or culpability arising from the multiple offenses. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.559" offset="13684794">And to the extent that the State stands before you now and quotes from parts of Mr. Burton's case where the trial judge did not explicitly make that finding, that only reinforces the strength of his habeas petition now, that under Washington state law, the judge needed to make that kind of an extra finding and the judge didn't do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.350" offset="13751981">Let me finally turn to a discussion about whether this Court's treatment of Walton and Apprendi could have given a State judge a reasonable basis to distinguish the system at issue in Blakely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.626" offset="13801091">We don't think it could because this Court didn't simply say in Apprendi that Walton stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.764" offset="13821676">It explicitly said the reason why the Arizona capital system as we understand it is okay is because it's nothing more than a system that is permissible under Williams against New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.073" offset="13858874">It's one where on the basis of the jury's finding of guilt that the death penalty is permissible without anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.634" offset="13889176">And so the only disagreement between the majority and Justice O'Connor's dissent was as to the way Arizona's system worked, but any judge that would have looked at Apprendi would have seen, the majority is telling us that a system is okay so long as the jury verdict itself allows the ultimate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.048" offset="13942780">That is exactly the kind of system that was not in place in Washington, so a judge should have full well realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.203" offset="13967439">And of course as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, once it became clear to this Court the way that Arizona's capital sentencing system functioned, this Court had little difficulty simply applying the Apprendi rule and agreeing that that system had to be invalid too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.759" offset="14025640">And just like the Blakely decision itself, not even the dissenters suggested that Apprendi dictated otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.259" offset="14047583">If this Court has no further questions, I'll submit the case.</text>
