            <text syncTime="14.158" offset="210532">In 1994, Congress enacted the equalization formula under the Impact Aid Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.080" offset="238222">It did so clearly and decisively, and described a methodology which was unambiguous, was self contained, reflected a recognized statistical standard, and assisted in actually promulgating... and... the intent of the Impact Aid Act, which is to benefit impacted local educational agencies or school districts and not fund the general educational program of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.372" offset="395479">In so doing, Congress removed from the Secretary the previously delegated authority to establish by regulation the equalization formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.096" offset="446365">The Secretary in turn in 1996, in enacting his regulations in response to the 1994 legislation, disavowed that he was engaging in any rulemaking or in fact in any interpretations of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.676" offset="528703">Instead, the Secretary sought and announced that he was proceeding under an exception to the public notice and comment laws, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), by stating that his regulations merely reflected changes in legislation, refining regulatory language.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.834" offset="1925314">And, and I would also point out the fact that again, there is a dramatic difference between what, what the statute proposed and, and the methodology described in the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.879" offset="1993441">And what's, what's very significant is if you go back to 1976 when the original regulation was promulgated, there was a debate that went on in the public notice and comment portion of these proceedings where they discussed whether you eliminate percentile of LEAs directly or whether you add this extra step of eliminating percentage, percentages of pupils and then eliminating LEAs as these pupils are eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.100" offset="2122382">I mean, it's a totally different process, totally different philosophy behind them and as we can see in this particular case, in New Mexico and in Alaska, totally different results.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.492" offset="2279952">And the reason is that if you, in order to run a percentile calculation you need units against which to run that, and then you need these, an identified set of variable standards such as they provided here, the average per pupil expenditures of each set of these LEAs or districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.628" offset="6112429">But in 1994, Congress had before it at least or had available to it information as to the, whether, what, how this particular formula would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.304" offset="6171152">There were only three and perhaps... three States, Kansas, Alaska, New Mexico, and perhaps Arizona... that had... that were trying to take advantage of the, of this narrow exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.662" offset="6224651">So they knew the configuration and the composition of these school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.449" offset="6247743">And so they could look if they wanted to... and there's no legislative history to this, but they could have looked if they had wanted to, to exactly what the practical effect would be of these two formulas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.026" offset="6302078">And the practical effect is that in New Mexico the formula which the Respondents contend is absurd reduced only 11 percent of the LEAs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.683" offset="6352651">And with the backdrop that this, that these LEAs should have been more or less equalized anyhow because of removing the disparate funding, that's, that's much more reasonable and certainly doesn't reflect an absurdity, and when you compare that to the Secretary's approach which eliminates 26 percent and cuts loose 23 school districts out of 89 from any consideration and you end up with kind of a core block in their 14 or 15 percent disparity, I think there may be those who could argue forcefully that that's an absurdity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.038" offset="8878065">Well, I think what we're really doing, Your Honor, is weighting each figure by the amount of pupils in the school district, and the reason we're doing that is to get a more accurate picture of the extent to which any one school district's per-pupil revenue figure contributes to the overall revenue pictures in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.297" offset="8935116">And if I could use one example which I think might help to crystallize why it's necessary to do this sort of weighting and why education finance practitioners routinely prescribe that you have to do this sort of weighting in order to avoid distorted results, if you consider the example of a State that has two school districts, and I'll use real examples from New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.807" offset="9001154">One would be the district that has the highest per-pupil revenues in the state, the Mosquero district, in which there's 57 pupils.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.061" offset="9026232">And the other would be the Albuquerque school district, the largest school district in the State, which serves 84,000 pupils.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.400" offset="9051518">Now the per-pupil revenues for Albuquerque are roughly $3,000 and the per-pupil revenues for Mosquero, the smaller school district, are roughly $7,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.903" offset="9081611">And if you imagine a State that consists of just those two districts, and you ask the question to pair with the statutory language, what is the 50th percentile, and I'll use 50th just for ease of analysis, what is the 50th percentile of such per-pupil revenues in the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.413" offset="9139603">One answer would be that you take the number for Mosquero, the 7,000 and you take the number for Albuquerque, the 3,000, you split the difference and you say the 50th percentile of per-pupil revenues in the State is $5,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2893.014" offset="11726039">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.466" offset="11743802">I'd like to begin with Justice Ginsburg's question, because I think that that is very illuminating to where we are today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.886" offset="11777448">This statute began against a history, an 18-year history where the agency had been delegated by Congress virtually carte blanche authority to devise equalization tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.129" offset="11830424">That was the earlier statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.247" offset="11838888">The agency had three tests at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.383" offset="11851531">One was the 25 percent disparity test that we see today and there were two other tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.520" offset="11875982">In 1994, what happened was the Secretary proposed to the Congress and the Congress following the Secretary's lead eliminated the two other tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.261" offset="11926973">That's, that's what was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.363" offset="11935436">And Justice Scalia asked well, why would the Secretary tie his hands?</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.165" offset="11954663">What happened was the Secretary no longer was satisfied or liked the other two tests and eliminated those and proposed the test that he had been using for 18 years to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.408" offset="12003564">Congress adopted that test and that's the test that we have today, the 25 percent disparity test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.228" offset="12034911">The difference is that whereas the Secretary had the free rein to develop that disparity test, however he wanted, previously, the Secretary... the Congress now told the Secretary in disparity, do the following things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.524" offset="12100008">First of all 25 percent is the maximum disparity that we are going to allow you, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.492" offset="12119965">And number two, take out the outliers in a range of 5 to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.251" offset="13615005">--Well, we always... we always will have disparity in the real world and that... and that's because lots of things cause disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.754" offset="13640919">In this case actually, local tax revenues are not the cause of disparity because there are no significant local tax revenues at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.344" offset="13671325">But disparity happens... in the top three or four districts in New Mexico you have under 100 students, or slightly over 100 students.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.550" offset="13708106">In a district that small, minor things, an insurance recovery for example, a couple hundred thousand dollar insurance recovery in a district of 87 students will generate $3,000 of revenue per member for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.376" offset="13771427">It's a distorting figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.745" offset="13776965">That's precisely what Congress is trying to get rid of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.696" offset="13788772">But when Congress says 5 percent, presumably Congress intends that 5 percent to have some uniform applicability across the country and not vary with a State like New Mexico where it would just eliminate five districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.123" offset="13854392">Or in our... in our neighboring State of Maryland, Montgomery County has the highest per-pupil revenues in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.412" offset="13883649">It has 16 percent of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.264" offset="13895038">Under petitioners' view, that... and it has 24 districts, so that district would be eliminated under petitioners' view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.203" offset="13930774">It would completely be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.170" offset="13938610">Yet under our view, the 10 percent would fall within that and we would keep it in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.416" offset="14107570">Well, sure, but then the question is whether the State can consider it when they're figuring out how much money to give it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.385" offset="14131499">--Well, remember, the State figures a total cost of program for every district starting from zero, number of students and dollars needed to manage those number of students, and the State supplies that amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.312" offset="14199208">So where the district gets some of that necessary money from another source, the State under equalization is allowed to just consider that that amount of money, in addition to what the State is going to provide, will provide the entire amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.212" offset="14294816">Mr. Chief Justice had a question as to whether or not the, an appendix is something different from a regulation or carries a different weight, and I haven't found anything determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.091" offset="14366287">But I would refer the Court to Young versus Community Nutrition Institute where it identifies something similar to an appendix as an example, and the Court says an example is just that, an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.767" offset="14428981">And I don't think we need the argument to prevail, but we would submit that it is at best confusion, it's confusing that the Secretary would take the body of the methodology proposed by Congress, put it in his, in the body of his regulation, and then refer the public to an appendix in order to, how to work the methodology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.132" offset="14522499">And in this appendix, he then flips what Congress intended and what he had in the body of his own regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.620" offset="14548413">I would also suggest that Congress cannot be presumed even in this instance to not be, at least have some input as to what was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.261" offset="14598986">In the Senate bill, my understanding is that there was a suggestion that the disparity figure would only be 10 percent and not 25 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.466" offset="14635766">That didn't make it through but the statute as it was written, and I think lasted for about a year or so, had the disparity amount going from 25 percent to 20 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.841" offset="14681324">That was subsequently amended and kept back up at the 25 percent level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.078" offset="14706297">So the idea that this was not a bill where Congress paid attention, I think, is not a warranted assumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="3644.851" offset="14733360">Mr. Van Amberg, could a State get to the same result?</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.219" offset="14750810">Let's say your reading of the statute is the only permissible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.421" offset="14767632">By combining school districts, it's no longer going to be the X school district and the Y school district, it will be the XY school district, and then the population would increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.899" offset="14837536">Still only one LEA.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald J. VanAmberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3673.582" offset="14848299">There is a provision, Justice Ginsburg, in the Impact Aid Act, and I think it's 7113, in which it basically says that if the Secretary of the Education perceives that a State is manipulating its LEAs in a way in which to take advantage of the, of this limited exception, it can disregard that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.614" offset="14936383">So I think there is built... I think Congress was one step ahead of us and recognized that possibility and addressed it.</text>
