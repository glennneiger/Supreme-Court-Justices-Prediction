            <text syncTime="10.206" offset="194309">This case concerns whether a police officer could be held personally liable for using force to terminate a dangerous high-speed pursuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="35.054" offset="293679">As the videotapes that have been admitted in evidence show, Respondent was driving on narrow two-lane roads at night.</text>

            <text syncTime="62.073" offset="401826">Deputy Scott at that point had tried to block the exit from the shopping center, but Mr. Harris was successful in using his vehicle to escape.</text>

            <text syncTime="3478.487" offset="14067419">In our brief we did list a number of felonies that Mr. Harris, that we believe he committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.141" offset="14094064">But I would go back to Garner, and Garner says that an armed suspect would have been a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.978" offset="14121440">And Garner also says that some misdemeanors such as drunk driving are more dangerous that some felonies such as white collar crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.151" offset="14150071">So I think the question should not be whether it's a technical issue of crossing the line from misdemeanor to felony, but the harm that is being caused by the continued driving that's exactly what occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.124" offset="14202002">And if I could respond to Justice Breyer's question about what to do in terms of responding to Mr. Marx's question, I think the Ornelas case says that you would review it for clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.616" offset="14251948">And in this case you would not owe deference of a finding of fact by the lower court.</text>
