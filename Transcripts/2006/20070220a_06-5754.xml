            <text syncTime="12.209" offset="199306">Under the system described in Justice Breyer's opinion for the Court in Booker, judges would no longer be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.046" offset="242669">That, of course, was a passage from this Court's recent decision in Cunningham versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.512" offset="268478">Mr. Rita is asking the Court in this case to reiterate in strong enforceable terms that it meant what it said in Booker, that the guidelines are merely advisory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.857" offset="317902">The Government's assertion that the guidelines deserve a presumption of reasonableness was nothing more than an unfounded claim put forth to justify its efforts to try and thwart the Booker decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.698" offset="373281">The ink wasn't given a chance to dry on the Booker decision before the Department of Justice issued a memo to all of its Federal prosecutors directing that they adhere to the guidelines and that they seek sentences within the guidelines in all but extraordinary cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.660" offset="449141">The district court below in this case did not treat the guidelines as advisory when it imposed a 33-month within guideline sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.298" offset="491668">The district court did not consider Mr. Rita's military record, the fact that he had been a combat soldier in two wars.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.128" offset="682989">The district court did not consider that information because there's nothing in the record where the district judge weighed any of that information to determine what... what effect to give any of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.319" offset="747773">I used to get them, and the district court would hear all the arguments and write down the word denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2234.096" offset="9086790">As I understand this Court's sequence of opinions from Apprendi leading up to the most recent decision in Cunningham, if the law establishes a level of punishment that may be imposed based on the facts found by the jury and says to the judge, judge, you may not go above it unless you find a particular fact, that fact is subject to the Sixth Amendment rule that the Court has announced and must be found by a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2273.753" offset="9245510">Now, what that leads me to conclude is that in order to escape the bright line rule that's been announced in this sequence of cases, including Booker itself and most recently Cunningham, a judge must be able to look at the set of facts that the jury found, determine what level of punishment would be advised by, say, a guidelines system, and not be bound to impose that level of punishment if the judge feels that a different level of punishment is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.663" offset="9369121">If that is a correct understanding of what this Court has held, it necessarily implies that a judge does have a certain amount of freedom in an advisory guidelines system to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission has found, give the judge's reasons, and then is subject to appellate review for the reasonableness of that explanation and, the Government submits, subject to a proportionality principle, so that the sentence that's imposed outside the guidelines is a reasonable one and not an arbitrary one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.716" offset="9505271">Now, if I'm wrong about that and it is not necessary for the court to have the legal freedom to be able to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission said, that would be very good from the Government's perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.674" offset="9561173">But as I understand the complementary rules that are established by Booker, what an advisory guidelines system requires is that the guidelines be treated as advice rather than mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.915" offset="9622091">So while the guidelines have determined that military service is not ordinarily relevant to the level of punishment, a judge may determine in a particular case that he disagrees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.689" offset="12009265">And in his ultimate explanation, though it is brief, he pointed to two of the Section 3553 factors explicitly.</text>
