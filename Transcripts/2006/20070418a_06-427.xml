            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="11.964" offset="201025">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.399" offset="214713">If this Court adheres to its State action ruling, it should now hold that the TSSAA has broad discretion to adopt and to enforcement contractual restrictions on athletic recruiting as a condition of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.907" offset="284722">Under this Court's cases, Brentwood cannot escape the contractual bargain it's made under the First Amendment, because the association offered it a reasonable choice as measured by the three criteria that this Court has used to identify unconstitutional conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.585" offset="363507">First, participation in the state tournaments is entirely voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.725" offset="383987">Second, the restrictions at issue here are germane to the legitimate goals of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.266" offset="410214">And third, enforcement of the rule here imposed only a minimal burden on speech of private concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.297" offset="442292">I would like to turn first to the issue of voluntariness, because that's a core issue in every case involving allegedly unconstitutional conditions.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="81.652" offset="479700">May I ask you a preliminary question, Ms. Mahoney?</text>
            <text syncTime="84.260" offset="490149">And that is, we are told that at the time this issue arose, the practice itself was all right, and it was all right for one school to invite students from another school to join the invitee school's practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.406" offset="578756">And now I take it that it's no longer permissible, that one school's, one school's practice, is reserved for its own students and not... others are not invited.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.871" offset="632568">But if it was permissible under the association's rules to invite students from other schools, then why is it impermissible to talk it up?</text>
            <text syncTime="133.586" offset="687425">I mean, you can do it, but you can't talk about it?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="136.600" offset="699546">Your Honor, actually the record indicates that it would be permissible to give the information about the date for the spring practice to the students who had signed an enrollment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.406" offset="758792">And that's at CAJA-705.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.467" offset="771017">It could have been sent in an enrollment packet, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.154" offset="781780">It could have been sent just as a schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.716" offset="792020">But instead the problem here was that it was sent from the coach in a personal solicitation to the students that really subtly pressured them to come to practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.258" offset="838100">This was a form of recruiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.772" offset="844160">Under question 3, which is the interpretive guidance for the recruiting rule, it very expressly says that coach-initiated contact with students who are enrolled at another school is not supposed to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.422" offset="902779">And so this fell within the terms of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.733" offset="916049">As the Sixth Circuit said, it would strain credulity to say that Brentwood didn't know that it shouldn't have sent this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.418" offset="938828">And their own headmaster acknowledged that it certainly should have been t kind of thing that they would have called about before doing it, and he was surprised that Coach Flatt had not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.698" offset="979892">So I think, Your Honor, that the first point is that, yes, this information could have been communicated to the students, but not in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.521" offset="1019180">And certainly the association could recognize that this was still a form of recruiting.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="222.113" offset="1041541">So in speech terms, there were alternative means to get the message out.</text>

          <turn speaker="maureen_e_mahoney" startTime="225.516" stopTime="247.506">
            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="225.516" offset="1055229">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.359" offset="1058573">This was speech of private concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.468" offset="1067037">It was about the time for football practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.061" offset="1077381">And there were other ways that that information could be communicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.027" offset="1093264">But the association has an interest in having prophylactic rules that prevent coaches from initiating communications with students before they started school, because even though they--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="247.506" offset="1143105">I think the briefs are... I think it's fair to characterize the Respondent's brief this way, or fair to concentrate on Pickering.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.272" offset="1170168">It seems to me that Pickering is the key here, and I took away that impression from your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.486" offset="1199112">If we said that it's commercial speech, I think that's a little far off the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.905" offset="1220741">If we said it's an unconstitutional condition, I'm not sure that helps either side that much, either.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.184" offset="1245819">--Your Honor, I think Pickering is really an example of an unconstitutional conditions analysis just in the employment context.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.400" offset="1278733">What the Court really says in a broad group of cases where the government or the State actor is not exercising sovereign power, if it's offering a benefit, if it's using funding to encourage activity, if it is engaging in a contractual relationship as it does in Umbehr, that what this court has said in Umbehr very explicitly is that when the government uses contractual power the constitutional concerns are not as great.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.186" offset="1385835">In Umbehr we said, the Court said, that in the independent contractor cases the interests of either party, the government or the contractor, are not quite so intense as they are with a public employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.883" offset="1436617">I thought that made sense when I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.632" offset="1447693">I'm not so sure it does any more.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.320" offset="1454380">Well, and in fact this Court said in Umbehr that, even though the interests were what different, the standards that had been applied in Connick and Pickering could easily accommodate the circumstances of dealing with--</text>

            <text syncTime="337.955" offset="1504953">Well, I suppose we could construct a hypothetical where we could say there's a very strong interest in the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.110" offset="1525538">So I'm not sure that that works as a general theorem.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.261" offset="4114168">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="996.024" offset="4137260">The position of the United States is that the court of appeals applied the wrong standard in deciding Brentwood's First Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.174" offset="4165786">This Court's decisions establish that when the government offers a benefit that a citizen is free to reject, it has much greater leeway in regulating speech than when it exercises its coercive sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.936" offset="4220852">As in cases where the Government acts as an employer, a contractor, a property owner, a service provider or a benefactor, the TSSAA offers a benefit, access to organized athletic competition, that a school may decline by choosing not to become a member of the association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.771" offset="4296189">Brentwood's First Amendment challenge to the TSSAA recruiting rule, therefore, is subject to deferential review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.830" offset="4328477">Deferential First Amendment review is appropriate in these contexts because the Government occupies a middle ground when it is not exercising its sovereign authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.391" offset="4370691">On the one hand the Government remains the Government no matter what authority it's exercising... so it is subject to the restrictions of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.684" offset="4407889">On the other hand, when the Government acts in a non-sovereign capacity, its position is comparable to that of private sector entities and it has to be able to make the same sorts of decisions that they make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.911" offset="4460761">It has to be able to decide what conduct is acceptable in its workplace, what activities may take place on its property, and the uses to which its grant money may be put.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.611" offset="4503602">So the First Amendment can't apply with the same force as when the Government acts in its sovereign capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.419" offset="4530769">For example, a government agency can tell its employees not to use offensive language with co-workers or customers, as Justice O'Connor pointed out in her plurality opinion in Waters versus Churchill, and that prohibition would not be subject to heightened First Amendment scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.571" offset="4607360">So, too, an athletic association can tell the students at its member schools that they can't use offensive language in dealing with opposing players or referees, as indeed the TSSAA bylaws in fact do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.563" offset="4667337">This is at page 202 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.295" offset="4682279">And that prohibition should not be subject to heightened First Amendment scrutiny either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.041" offset="4701296">The same is true of other rules that govern membership in and define the character of a voluntary athletic association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.302" offset="4738286">As applied to TSSAA's recruiting rule, the deferential standard of review is easily satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.707" offset="4767961">Prohibiting the use of undue influence in recruiting or attempting to secure or retain high school athletes we think is self-evidently reasonable in light of the purposes underlying the rule, which include preventing the exploitation of children and ensuring that sports remains subordinate to academics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.260" offset="4854165">Prohibiting coaches from contacting students who have not enrolled at the coach's school is likewise reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.556" offset="4883318">Either because that prohibition can reasonably be reviewed as an instance of undue influence itself, or because it is a reasonable prophylactic measure to prevent the exertion of undue influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.722" offset="4940056">And finally defining enrollment in the context of the prohibition on coaches contacting students to exclude the situation where a student has somehow announced its intention... announced his intention to attend its school, for example, as in this case by signing an enrollment contract, is reasonable as well for the reasons Ms. Mahoney mentioned in responding to Justice Souter's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.569" offset="5043396">Somebody who signs an enrollment contract may not decide... may ultimately decide to attend a different school, and there is evidence in the record that students sometimes sign multiple enrollment contracts and sometimes decide to attend a different school after signing one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.346" offset="5106508">This is at page 240 of the joint appendix and there are additional citations to the record on page 6 of the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.451" offset="5134929">In short, while the First Amendment has a role to play in this case and cases like it, it is a very limited role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.525" offset="5171187">And the recruiting rule easily satisfies what we think is the appropriately deferential standard of review that applies in circumstances of this type.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.884" offset="7468604">The Association then informed the school that it was able to allow this young man to come and lift weights at the school based upon that letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.429" offset="11902838">Now, the school did put forward evidence about one youngster named Jacques Curry who was alleged to have been recruited by Bart King.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.378" offset="13474678">Again, we think that the First Amendment framework that exists for regulatory cases fits this case well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.015" offset="13521176">The only difference is whether or not there's a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.279" offset="13534237">We think there's not a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.933" offset="13540820">The Government has claimed that they can define away First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.933" offset="13556807">In our brief we address that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.992" offset="13565061">We don't believe that the Government can define away First Amendment rights, and there is not a case that they have cited really that supports the position that the First Amendment should apply differently in this context, where the Government is regulating just because it is, the source of authority is a different source of authority, a non-sovereign source of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.938" offset="13652833">The Southeastern Promotions case, the Ibanez case, those cases, the Barnett case, and the Fox case, Justice Scalia's opinion in the Fox case, make it clear that the source of authority, in that case universities, is not determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.460" offset="13718975">The Fox case discussed the elements of commercial speech and that arose in a university context, but it's been applied across the board in all commercial speech cases, regulatory cases, whether there was sovereign power or, as in the case of Fox, it was not sovereign power at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.735" offset="13788042">So we think that the First Amendment doctrine, the rubric that we've described in our brief, is the proper one that should be applied in this circumstance and that there's not a need to carve out a special exception, which is what the Government is asking for and what the TSSAA is asking for, to generally applicable First Amendment doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.103" offset="13869545">This is a case of content-based regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.227" offset="13881979">The time, place, and manner defense therefore cannot work as a defense, and we think therefore, the TSSAA case collapses under First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.411" offset="13922730">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.499" offset="13955122">If I could respond to the due process issues, this is still a very important claim because if in fact the association has violated civil rights by failing to give due process Brentwood would still be entitled to an award of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.476" offset="14027011">And I think it's critical that when an association enters into a contract and agrees upon procedures, that if those procedures can... are not followed, a member of the association can bring a breach of contract action in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.080" offset="14101407">But Brentwood did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.375" offset="14106632">Instead it tried to constitutionalize this contract dispute and assert rights under Section 1983.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3494.918" offset="14132754">I thought it had some State claims as pendant claims.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="3497.605" offset="14143517">The only State claim they had as a pendant claim was arbitrary action under State law, and the district court dismissed that because it found that the questions were sufficiently novel that he didn't feel that he should entertain jurisdiction over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.665" offset="14195762">But they did not assert a breach of contract claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.071" offset="14205375">And it's important to note that the bylaws actually provide that a member must be given, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.113" offset="14233587">"notice of the charges and an opportunity to present its case at a hearing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.126" offset="14249574">So if they actually did not get notice of the charges involving Bart King, it would have been a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.140" offset="14277682">So that's the first problem, is that the court of appeals didn't even look at the fact that they had a contract remedy, just like the contractor had in Lujan, and they simply weren't taking advantage of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.071" offset="14321358">Second, the suggestion that they were not actually given notice is contradicted by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.602" offset="14351556">And it's not issues of credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.177" offset="14357825">This is just an ultimate conclusion about whether they had sufficient notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.975" offset="14372976">And if you look at the record, the exchange of letters, at JA-205 is the letter that starts by disclosing the charges, and it specifically discloses that the association investigators have talked to a number of middle school students, have talked to a number of middle school coaches, and details precisely what those witnesses have said about Bart King.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.433" offset="14478825">Now they say, well, we didn't know that Bart King was still involved by the time we got to the last hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.148" offset="14497737">But look in fact what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.569" offset="14507350">They came to the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.008" offset="14513097">They submitted the affidavit of Bart King.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.913" offset="14524800">One of their live witnesses was Jacques Curry and the only thing he testified about was his relationship with Bart King.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.206" offset="14553953">And then they ran out of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3603.844" offset="14568477">They had Bart King there.</text>
