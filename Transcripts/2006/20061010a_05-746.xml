            <text syncTime="7.577" offset="183852">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.329" offset="198794">The fundamental question in this case is whether the common law doctrine of equivalence between defendant negligence and plaintiff negligence applies under the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.744" offset="240486">The doctrine of equivalence is, I think, most clearly stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which is reproduced on page 19 of our blue brief in the middle paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.621" offset="279983">And I think it is worth taking a second to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.022" offset="289596">The rules which determine the causal relation between a plaintiff's negligent conduct and the harm resulting to him are the same as those determining the causal relation between the defendant's negligent conduct and resulting harm to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.100" offset="337870">That is a principle of law that has been in effect long before the Federal Employers Liability Act was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.745" offset="364515">It is obviously a restatement of the law in 1965, and it is an absolutely clear statement of the law as it applies today.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.320" offset="390742">There is nothing in the Federal Employers Liability Act that remotely modifies the doctrine of equivalence.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.153" offset="418118">The two provisions, section 51 talks about negligence resulting from... or negligence in whole or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.449" offset="447271">And section 53, which describes the contributory negligence portion or comparative negligence talks about negligence attributable to.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.935" offset="481230">None of that deviates at all from any kind of common law doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.338" offset="494814">Negligence inherently calls for an analysis of proximate causation.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="89.351" offset="510905">Except that the... what was it, the Rogers case, which said that the... well, you debate whether it said that, but let's assume that it said that the rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the negligence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.754" offset="592512">The basis for that holding was that in whole or in part language which is used for the negligence of the defendant, but not used for the contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.482" offset="639428">So if you believe that that case was at least decided for the right reason, it seems to me there's a good argument that it changed it for the one, but not for the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.531" offset="751650">That doctrine is unaffected by that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.512" offset="767532">Now, I'd like to take issue with the interpretation of Rogers, if you want, at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.017" offset="785609">But it seems to me the doctrine of equivalence is fundamentally different from the doctrine of proximate causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.429" offset="803163">And therefore, you can change one without affecting the other one whatsoever.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="165.881" offset="817060">Mr. Phillips, the fundamental problem, at least for me, in this case is that there was no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the judge gave on negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.859" offset="872962">There was an instruction requested by the defendant on contributory negligence, which read,</text>
            <text syncTime="188.274" offset="906608">"such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injury. "</text>
            <text syncTime="195.580" offset="935865">That was the only instruction objected to, because the refusal to give that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.786" offset="964600">But you seem to be using that as a lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which no objection was made.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="213.162" stopTime="265.538">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="213.162" offset="1006187">That's not our attack, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.205" offset="1018308">Our objection, which is reproduced in 28A of the cert... of the petition's appendix, that says... and I think the current MAI instruction has a different causation standard for comparative fault, meaning that under Missouri's rules, we must prove that such negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to the cause... to cause the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.097" offset="1085912">And that misstates the law, because of the doctrine of equivalence.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.967" offset="1101377">That's our initial argument, is that no matter how you analyze this, whether you do it from a proximate cause or a slightest cause standard as the appropriate way to evaluate our negligence, that same standard has to be applied in evaluating the plaintiff's negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.910" offset="1169086">That's the core doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.781" offset="1176610">That's what we sought certiorari on.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.771" offset="1184551">The argument with respect to Rogers was not an argument we put into this case, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.526" offset="1203568">It's an argument that the Respondent put into this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.538" offset="1215689">I take it you would be satisfied... not wholly satisfied, but substantially satisfied if we said, yeah, we accept the doctrine of equivalence, and we think the instruction on contributory negligence was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.304" offset="1266680">Because that would mean in the next case, you would get a proximate cause instruction on defendant's negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.374" offset="1310983">But at the end of the day, I think the right answer in this case is that the Court ought to go ahead and decide whether or not Rogers really did work a sea change in the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.827" offset="1460822">What we're saying is, in response to the Respondent's argument which seeks to undermine the doctrine of equivalence based on an overreading, I would argue, of Rogers, that that interpretation is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.224" offset="1506379">And if we're right that that interpretation is incorrect, we would win on the doctrine of equivalence for two different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.389" offset="1531039">The first one that Justice Souter described.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.530" offset="1539607">And the second one would be that to the extent that there's any equivalence, there's no problem here because proximate cause is required in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.176" offset="1570223">And we think that that's an issue that the Court doesn't have to decide, but certainly could.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.467" offset="1879408">And I would say, one, Rogers doesn't speak to the doctrine of equivalence at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.354" offset="4522895">Let me take the first question first, and then I'll address the second one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.398" offset="4539091">There were three theories that the plaintiff put forward of the negligence of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.120" offset="4558004">Not just that the one driver drove the other driver off the side of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.123" offset="4573991">There was also a claim that the road wasn't constructed properly, and there was a claim that he wasn't given adequate safety instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.179" offset="4606174">And there's no way, given that this was a general verdict, to remotely figure out which of those theories was the one the jury thought was correct, and how that theory might line up with a causation theory, based on the plaintiff's own particular view and the defendant's arguments in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.989" offset="4677436">So it is not as cut and dried as he said, he said, and that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.423" offset="4691228">They were more theories in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.421" offset="4695199">And you know, if you accept the idea that jury instructions count, and there's clearly a very different burden that's imposed on one as opposed to the other, then it seems to me the answer is there's no way for the Court to make a harmless error determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.721" offset="4748384">It is also a question of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.432" offset="4755176">It ought to be decided by the Missouri courts in the first instance in any event, I would think, rather than this Court trying to sort through the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.610" offset="4787986">With respect to the argument at the close of the case, I don't remember any specific arguments that either side made with respect to the burdens, because the jury instructions were what they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.105" offset="4837932">And I think each side was saying, you know, we really didn't do anything wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.768" offset="4852561">And so that's basically the way that it was presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.498" offset="14167512">I'd like to address just sort of two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.679" offset="14176185">One is the minimalist issue that Justice Breyer asked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.172" offset="14190187">It seems to me that the minimalist way to look at this case is we raised the question of whether or not the Missouri standard which says that you cannot deviate from our designated instructions creates a disparity in the way you approach negligence and contributory negligence, that disparity is inconsistent with the common law doctrines, and nothing in FELA modifies it, and it's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.357" offset="14274928">And that by itself warrants the case being set aside and a new jury being... and a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.600" offset="14303872">That's the simplest way to resolve the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.660" offset="14312126">If the Court wishes to go forward and deal with the issue that Justice Souter addressed, then the question is, what does Rogers mean and what do you do with this "in whole or in part" language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.059" offset="14353713">And if you go back... you asked the question, Justice Souter, you know, what does the common law say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.381" offset="14371059">We cite this on page 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.053" offset="14377746">If its negligence contributes proximately to the injury, no matter how slightly... there must be a dozen cases that we cite in those briefs that talk about no matter how slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.291" offset="14418706">And they refer to "in whole or in part" as language that still recognizes that you still require proximate causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.164" offset="14450157">The reality is nothing in Rogers remotely casts doubt on cases like Brady that say but-for causation is not enough, you have to have proximate causation, or Earnest, where this Court said that proximate causation is the correct jury instruction that has to be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.366" offset="14526957">This Court said nothing about that in Rogers.</text>
