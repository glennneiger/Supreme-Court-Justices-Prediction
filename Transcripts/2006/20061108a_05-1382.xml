            <text syncTime="16.193" offset="217021">This case presents the same basic constitutional question concerning the Federal Partial Birth Abortion Act as the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="246801">Of course, the Ninth Circuit in the decision under review here went much further in invalidating the Federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.519" offset="270415">If I could begin by talking about whether what we're talking about here is medical necessity or just some marginal effect on the risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.708" offset="307091">I think in order to fairly understand the argument that respondents are making in this case, their argument has to be a matter of simply marginal risks, because one illustration of this, as I indicated in the first argument, if a doctor really believes that a D&amp;X procedure is the way to go in a case then there's no ban on the procedure as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.139" offset="392878">What the act bans is the infliction of the D&amp;X procedure on a living fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.358" offset="413671">So if a doctor really thinks the D&amp;X procedure is the way to go, he can induce fetal demise at the outset of the procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="72.262" offset="441361">But the problem with this is that there... well, some doctors absolutely agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.214" offset="457139">I mean, you know, my list over here, in which I have hundreds of references from this thing, is doctor after doctor who takes the other position, and they say, Look, all that we're doing here is trying to remove the fetus in a single pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.874" offset="515758">The fetus is going to die anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.176" offset="524953">It's not viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.545" offset="530491">We're trying to remove it in a single pass, and the reason we're trying to do that is if we don't, there may be bone fragments left inside the womb.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.667" offset="570928">There may be fetal parts left inside the womb.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.952" offset="584094">Every time you make another pass, it turns out there's an added risk of scarring or hurting the inside of the womb.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.773" offset="611366">If you try to induce demise through a drug before, there is serious risks of introducing drugs into the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.360" offset="645743">If the woman has uterine cancer, it's a serious problem of not trying to get the child out as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.549" offset="674478">If you have preeclampsia or eclampsia, where you're in a situation where the woman will be dead in five minutes or 10 minutes, there could be such a situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.506" offset="718363">Get it out as fast as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.056" offset="728499">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.725" offset="731215">Now, I know there are doctors who think the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.494" offset="742291">There's lots of testimony of the doctors who think roughly along the lines I've taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.946" offset="764025">That was true in Stenberg as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.350" offset="777713">So I think the issue is not that you don't have support... you do... but that the support is contraverted, and therefore, what do we do in that case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="165.539" offset="814494">Well, Justice Breyer, let me take as a point of departure the specific risks that you associated with the injection that induces fetal demise, because if there isn't a significant risk to that injection, then all the other benefits that are associated with the D&amp;X procedure don't matter because they can perform the D&amp;X procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.333" offset="885651">Now if you look through the record on this point, I think you will not find any testimony that supports a significant risk from that injection.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.171" offset="916998">Yes, there are risks because there are risks from any medical procedure, but the risks are not significant.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="197.427" offset="941971">Is there a definition in the law of significant risk, other than doctors saying, I've been trained to try to save life and I want to perform the safest possible way?</text>
            <text syncTime="211.001" offset="996306">Is there some legal definition of what's a small risk, a big risk, a giant risk?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="216.739" offset="1019294">With all respect, I think if a single injection that doesn't take any particular risk other than the fact that it's an injection, if that counts as a significant risk, then we might as well strike the word "significant" from the discussion in Stenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.279" offset="1069449">And Then I think what you have is that it's very clear that their position is one of zero tolerance for any marginal risk to maternal health.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="237.402" offset="1101945">Well, my question is the same as Justice Breyer's.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.687" offset="1115006">Is there anything in the literature, including medical literature, that talks about significant or minor risks?</text>
            <text syncTime="248.276" offset="1145413">I mean, you fill out forms when you go to the dentist about risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.328" offset="1165580">Now, if... if the chance of death is one out of 100, is that significant?</text>
            <text syncTime="262.369" offset="1201733">I mean, I don't know.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="263.202" stopTime="335.481">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="263.202" offset="1205077">Well, it's a very difficult question to evaluate in the abstract, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.671" offset="1222944">And I think it actually, that question, though, has direct bearing on this case, because Congress after all found that there was some risks with the D&amp;X procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.110" offset="1256695">The most prominent one that I would point to is the risk of cervical incompetence because the D&amp;X procedure does... it does require additional dilation, which can be associated with risks of losing future pregnancies.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.434" offset="1306014">And that was born out, although not at a level of statistical significance, in the Chasen study by a plaintiff practitioner, where 2 of the 17 women who had the D&amp;X procedure and were available for follow up care had an early preterm pregnancy in the follow up.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.677" offset="1362961">So I think those risks are born out in the only study that's available.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.579" offset="1378634">And I think the question becomes, now, if D&amp;X were some life saving procedure for something that there was no other known cure for, you might think, well, those are the risks you run.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.651" offset="1418863">But when there remains available the D&amp;E procedure, which has been well tested and works every single time as a way to terminate the pregnancy, then I think risks that, if you were talking about a life saving treatment for some life threatening condition with no known cure, those risks might not be significant in that context.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="335.481" stopTime="345.837">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="335.481" offset="1494200">Well, but there is a risk if the uterine wall is compromised by cancer or some forms of preeclampsia and it's very thin, there's a risk of being punctured.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="345.837" stopTime="459.545">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="345.837" offset="1535682">There is a risk, Justice Kennedy, but I think that, first of all, that even in those limited circumstances, that the marginal risk between the D&amp;X procedure and the D&amp;E procedure are really as far as I can tell nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.114" offset="1592734">Even in that condition, unless there's some reason not to put the injection in, if the doctor really thought the D&amp;X procedure was the way to go, he could begin, as Dr. Carhart does in every single case after the 17th week and start off with a digoxin injection or potassium chloride injection, induce fetal demise, and he has nothing to worry about from this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.593" offset="1670683">And I think the very fact that they are attributing significant risks to a single injection shows that at bottom their position is a zero tolerance position.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.283" offset="1705374">And that's a legitimate position, I suppose, but it's completely inconsistent with this Court's precedence, most notably the Casey decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.103" offset="1732750">Because if all you needed to do is point to some marginal risk, then this Court should have struck down the 24-hour waiting period in the Casey decision, because the plaintiffs there said the 24-hour waiting condition has imposed significant risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.345" offset="1785622">They were backed in that point by an amicus brief by ACOG.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.630" offset="1798788">But this Court didn't say, well, you know, you're right, there's marginal risks, we're going to apply a zero tolerance rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.034" offset="1820417">This Court instead upheld the 24-hour period, even though it required overruling Akron I's contrary decision and this Court pointed, of course, to--</text>
            <text syncTime="426.808" offset="1859496">Akron I as an exemplar of the pre Casey decisions that put too little weight on the legitimate countervailing interest that the government has in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.395" offset="1893873">And so with respect, I think that the argument they are making is effectively an argument for returning to Akron I and Thornburgh, where the rule of law was that there would be no interference between a doctor and the doctor's patient and the doctor's best judgment as to how to treat the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.357" offset="1961687">This Court of course consciously moved away from that in Casey and expressly repudiated the language in Akron I and Thornburgh to that effect.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="459.545" offset="1990422">May I follow up on a question the Chief Justice asked you during the last argument?</text>
            <text syncTime="463.247" offset="2005260">We got into the government's construction of the statute to narrow it to intentional situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.937" offset="2036084">Would you explain a little more exactly what situations you would exclude and what you would include in your interpretation of the statute?</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="477.691" stopTime="532.159">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="477.691" offset="2063042">Well, justice Stevens, let me answer it this way and maybe if you want me to take you specifically to the text, I can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.245" offset="2085299">But I think the bottom line would be that under our view of the statute, the most important thing is for those doctors, like Dr. Cranen or Dr. Vivicar, who try to do the D&amp;E procedure every time, and they succeed 99 or 100 percent of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.886" offset="2139842">Well, in the 1 percent of the cases where they inadvertently deliver the fetus past the anatomical landmark, we would say they are not covered by the statute because they would not satisfy what is really a compound mens rea requirement in the statute, which requires that the delivery of the fetus be intentional and deliberate and for the purpose of committing the overt act of killing fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.966" offset="2224166">And in those cases, of course, the intent of the doctor performing the D&amp;E isn't to deliver the fetus at all; it's to deliver a fetal arm or a fetal leg as part of the dismemberment procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.940" offset="2268051">So they would not be covered by the mens rea requirement of the statute.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="532.159" offset="2280904">Would you measure the mens rea at the outset of the procedure when they begin the dilation a day or two before the actual operation is performed, or is it at the time of beginning the operation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="543.365" stopTime="628.868">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="543.365" offset="2325730">I think you could measure it from either time point.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.817" offset="2335552">I think the better view is actually that it would be measured from the beginning of the surgical operation, though the evidence of their intent at the beginning of the dilation would be very, very relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.505" offset="2374318">The reason I would say that is I think if somebody tries to dilate and then gets an extreme amount of dilation at the point they start the procedure, I think the intent of Congress would still be for them to do a dismemberment procedure at that point, rather than an intact removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.867" offset="2439728">But if this Court thought that the constitutional line mattered on the answer to that, then you could start from the beginning of the dilation because I think in fairness the differences between the two procedures are probably most manifest in the dilation regimen.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.377" offset="2493749">I also think, though, the record supports the notion that there are differences even once you begin the procedure as to how you manipulate the fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.048" offset="2524469">I mean, Dr. Chasen for example, who is trying to do the intact removal, says that after he has one leg removed he effectively tries to reach back up and swing the second leg across so he can remove the entire fetal body.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.438" offset="2573998">If you're... obviously if you're performing a dismemberment D&amp;E you're not trying to swing the second leg across; you're simply continuing to pull or twist on the first extremity that presents itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.461" offset="2610151">So I think there are differences even at the procedural level.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.579" offset="2622585">So I think that it would probably be most consistent with Congress's intent to measure it from the beginning of the surgical part of the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.733" offset="2647245">But if you, as I say, in order to save the statute, I think it's amenable to the contrary interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="630.070" offset="2672531">But just before you leave, I mean, this is why it's so hard for me to get into the medical procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.374" offset="2693743">I heard you as saying, perhaps wrongly, that well, the doctor can always use a lethal injection to kill the fetus.</text>

            <text syncTime="767.941" offset="3224029">But this is one thing that I think my colleagues on the other side of the podium will agree with me on, is that their doctors don't think that this is a safer procedure in rare cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.117" offset="3896734">And you can, you can, you can tell you can tell from the fact that a doctor, like one of the plaintiffs in the Nebraska case, Dr. Fitzhugh, says, that, well, I don't do the intact removal because if I wanted to do that I would have to do a second round of dilation with a second round of laminaria.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.312" offset="3957547">And of course, that second round of laminaria is also a medical procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.280" offset="3973429">Like the injection, every medical procedure has some risks, risks of infection.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.251" offset="3993282">If you looked at Dr. Creinen's testimony, this is at 174 A to 177 A in the Eighth Circuit petition appendix, he says that he doesn't like to do a second round of laminaria dilation because it's painful to the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.059" offset="4048558">And that's his testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="978.296" offset="4065485">And as I say, this idea of trying to prohibit a practice that involves further dilation is not an irrelevant concern from a health standpoint, because one of the things that Congress heard was that there were risks to future pregnancies from cervical incompetence.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.638" offset="4126820">And that's a particularly important concern because first of all, the plaintiff's experts aren't in a very good position to evaluate that risk because they provide abortion services, not follow up services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.411" offset="4165900">So they're not in a good position to judge that risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.880" offset="4175826">Second of all, the only study we have here points out that there is a greater incidence of that preterm delivery in the group that had a D&amp;X procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.069" offset="4212606">Now again they say, they are going to come up and say well it's not statistically significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.938" offset="4228071">But the numbers I think are striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.722" offset="4235176">They had 17 women in the group that had a D&amp;X and came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.590" offset="4250641">Two of them had a preterm pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.526" offset="4258373">The D&amp;E group was much larger, 45, and two of them had a preterm delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.097" offset="4276659">Now I think as a commonsense manner, if you know that you were going to be in a room with 17 people where two people were going to have something bad happen to them, or in a room with 45 and two... bad things were going to happen to two, I know which room I'd like to be in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.020" offset="5272342">But I don't think the constitutionality in this facial challenge where that hasn't been a feature of the challenge turns on the answer to that question one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.193" offset="5305047">I think in regards to the Chasen study the last thing I would say about it though is that it's important because most of the arguments on the other side are intuitive arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.131" offset="5344858">They are intuitive arguments, that they would be less passive, so that will be more safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.083" offset="5360636">And what I think is telling is that the same intuition would lead to the notion that it would be quicker and there will be less blood loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.420" offset="5385922">And when that was actually tested in a controlled study, it turned out not to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.324" offset="5405566">The last thing I'll say about the Chasen study is there was this indication that the two most serious complications were associated with the D&amp;E procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.164" offset="5436913">But one thing that I think is important to understand about the Chasen study is it is a retrospective study of Dr. Chasen and his partner's own practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.520" offset="5470350">Now what they do in every case is they set out to perform a D&amp;X procedure, and so what they are studying and what they call the D&amp;X procedures, that cohort are the times when they tried to do a D&amp;X procedure and they were successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.077" offset="5528551">The D&amp;E cohort from this study, is you know, are those circumstances where he and his partner tried to do a D&amp;X procedure, weren't successful and did a D&amp;E procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.218" offset="5569198">Now why is that significant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.635" offset="5574840">Because it shows as Chasen noted in his article that in those situations that were D&amp;Es and they were associated with serious complications there was nothing he could have done about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.491" offset="5610262">He could have performed a D&amp;X, he tried to perform a D&amp;X and it wasn't successful, so he ended up performing a D&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.645" offset="5634922">And so I really think on balance the Chasen study ends up supporting our position, because the first time you have any kind of controlled study what you find is that some of the intuition turns out not to be true, and the safety benefits from these are a wash, and the one sort of loose end from the study is the threat that you do see from the greater dilation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.372" offset="5713811">Now it's not statistically robust, but I think that it does bear out one of Congress's concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.774" offset="5819346">And as I tried to indicate in rebuttal, that's really not a concern because, the difference is whether some clinics will only offer the D&amp;X and the D&amp;E and will say that basically you've got to go to a hospital to get the induction procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.699" offset="5879114">But that doesn't really, I don't think matter, because the point is anybody who can get a D&amp;X who is at a clinic can also get a D&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.536" offset="5910461">In every single case the doctor that can perform the D&amp;X can also offer the D&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.590" offset="5930628">And since the D&amp;E is what the district court in the Nebraska case described as the gold standard of saftey, I think every woman in every case is going to have that option of a safe, of a safe pregnancy option.</text>

            <text syncTime="1508.363" offset="6185792">That's the language basically, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.382" offset="6193838">And in this one it says you can't deliver past the fetal trunk for the purpose of performing an overt act that the doctor knows will kill the fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.704" offset="6239082">So I look at those two sets of words.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.209" offset="6365096">But if what Cathcart was worried about was the fact that a doctor who sets out to perform a D&amp;E will, making a pass, think he'll have the fetus dismembered and, lo and behold, it doesn't dismember, so the bottom portion of the fetus descends outside the womb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.288" offset="6449420">And there he is and now what happens?</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.642" offset="6566866">Here the compound mens rea requirement works with the anatomical landmark language, so that what you need to satisfy the statute is the deliberate and purposeful intent to remove the fetus past the navel with the purpose of performing an overt act that will, will lead to fetal demise, which is not covered when you don't even have the intent to take it out of the... past the anatomical landmark in the first place and you're trying to do something that's going to take place in utero.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.696" offset="6691104">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.902" offset="6731855">In Casey, this Court reaffirmed that the government cannot ban previability abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.222" offset="6761217">Despite Casey, Stenberg suggested that there is a narrow category of previability abortions, intact D&amp;Es, as this Court understood that term in Stenberg, that can be banned so long as the ban contains a health exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.683" offset="6831016">But I'd like to leave the health exception question aside for a minute and turn to the scope of the law that Congress has enacted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.873" offset="6863826">The question is whether Congress can enact a previability abortion ban that does not track the hallmark of intact D&amp;E abortions as this Court understood that term in Stenberg and by doing so to ban a substantially greater array of abortions than would be banned had the law faithfully tracked the language in the Stenberg opinions about what constitutes an intact D&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.023" offset="6972391">And I'm referring both to the majority opinion in Stenberg and in the dissents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.427" offset="6990050">It is our position that this Court must reject Congress's effort to exploit the limited license that this Court seemingly granted in Stenberg because to allow such an expansion of previability abortions that can be banned would set the stage for continued legislative efforts to ban other iterations of the classic D&amp;E method of abortion until truly there would be nothing left at all of Casey's holding that it is unconstitutional to ban previability second trimester abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.583" offset="7138634">The government in this case has conceded that the act bans more abortions than merely the intact D&amp;E as this Court understood it in Stenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.689" offset="7179072">But I want to highlight for the Court how the language of this act departs from the hallmarks of intact D&amp;E and how these departures place doctors at risk of prosecution for the very facet of D&amp;E abortions, and by that I mean all D&amp;E abortions, that enhance their safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.952" offset="7268097">There is three respects in which the act departs from the hallmarks of intact D&amp;E as understood in Stenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.458" offset="7302161">First, the act does not require breach extraction of an intact fetus to the head, one of the primary hallmarks that this Court understood in Stenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.747" offset="7343330">Instead, the act applies once the fetus is extracted past the navel, a far more frequent occurrence than extraction to the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.455" offset="7382095">And in fact the government in its briefing both in their initial brief and in their reply concede that in any of what the government calls standard D&amp;Es a living fetus can be extracted past the fetal navel before demise occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.583" offset="7450641">In addition, the act does not require the fetus to be delivered intact at the end of the procedure, another component of what is considered to be a hallmark of intact D&amp;E in Stenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.641" offset="7498811">In fact, the word intact appears nowhere in the statute and again the government concedes that some nonintact D&amp;Es would violate this law as drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.948" offset="7552100">In fact, the government contends that one of the D&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.737" offset="7587209">And finally, the act does not require that the fetus be extracted in a breach presentation at all, even though in Stenberg the Court thought of the breach extraction as one of the hallmarks of intact D&amp;E.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.099" offset="8072669">First of all, the clear line that this Court drew in Stenberg was essentially the line at intact delivery to the head followed by an act that results in fetal demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.907" offset="8119898">Very clearly what this Court understood in Stenberg could... was, was an intact D&amp;E and several members of the court suggested that that would be constitutional to ban.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.249" offset="8185309">But the question here is is it really essential to an appropriate line that we talk, that we describe it as a, as a breach delivery or a nonbreach delivery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.557" offset="8342566">Today General Clement seems to be arguing that there is a different line that's protected in this statute, a different line than the Court recognized in Stenberg, and the line is about where the fetus is when demise occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.800" offset="8395542">But, but this Court in Stenberg understood that even in a classical D&amp;E, a standard D&amp;E, as the government calls it, part of the fetus is outside the woman's uterus when fetal demise occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.525" offset="8446429">The Court recognized that fetal demise occurs even in a standard D&amp;E when, after a part of the fetus is drawn out of the women's uterus, resistance is met, disarticulation occurs, and after that fetal demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.985" offset="8512257">So even in a standard D&amp;E the line that the government today is offering up, the line of inside or outside the uterus, would be violated in any D&amp;E--</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.285" offset="8837429">On page 32 of their initial brief they refer to, they describe two circumstances that they say or two parts of the law that they say saved the law from banning nonintact D&amp;Es.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.692" offset="8887062">The first is the anatomical landmark and the second is the requirement of an overt act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2303.854" offset="9367715">And so in every D&amp;E, regardless of whether the physician expects to have an intact fetus at the very end of the procedure, they do want to minimize the... the amount of instrumentation and bring it out in as few parts as possible and so there is a deliberate and intentional delivery of the fetus as far as possible which often can be past the navel, though in most cases it won't be up to the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.141" offset="9484848">So that's why the line that this Court drew in Stenberg is the line that first of all delineates between two distinct procedures, intact D&amp;E and nonintact D&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.764" offset="9527375">The difference between those two procedures is whether the fetus is extracted to the head or not to the head before demise occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.018" offset="9556319">This, this statute doesn't draw that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.304" offset="9565514">It draws a different line and in doing that, it captures far more abortions than the other law would and, and the key thing is that if this law stands with the past the navel line the inevitable result is that doctors in order to try to avoid the reach of this statute will have to stop trying to minimize the instrumentation and stop trying to draw the fetus out as intact as possible because often when that happens--</text>

            <text syncTime="3206.324" offset="12977629">In the Solicitor General's reply brief they talk about the promise of Stenberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.826" offset="12995601">Well, the promise of Stenberg was absolutely betrayed by Congress in this case in both respects, both in terms of preserving the health of the woman and allowing her to use what a substantial medical authority thinks is the safest procedure for the woman, and in terms of holding the line at a limited ban on previability abortions given that Casey recognizes that women have a constitutional right to choose to end their pregnancy previability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.879" offset="13107823">I was going to address briefly some of the concerns that the Solicitor General offered about some of the health risks of intact D&amp;E and cervical incompetence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.201" offset="13153067">Just briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.269" offset="13157351">The, all of the government witnesses in this case agreed that the congressional findings completely overstate any risks of intact D&amp;E there is no, there is no reasonable basis to conclude that intact D&amp;E puts a woman at any greater risk of harm than standard D&amp;E, and in fact the evidence is quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.265" offset="13245331">It averts catastrophic health consequences in some circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.984" offset="13260273">There is no strong evidence that intact D&amp;E has any impact on cervical incompetence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.638" offset="13282843">The Solicitor General talks at length about the two cases in Dr. Jason's study, but both of those women who experienced cervical incompetence had, in future pregnancy, had had cervical incompetence in prior pregnancies, and that's a condition that tends to stay with the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.164" offset="13352956">So there is no reason to think that it was the intact D&amp;E itself that caused cervical incompetence in the subsequent pregnancies because of intact D&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.573" offset="13402589">And finally, yes, it's true that Dr. Chasen used intact D&amp;E or attempted to use intact D&amp;E in all cases, and the women who had D&amp;Es, three of them suffered very serious medical consequences after having a D&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.785" offset="13475418">The Solicitor General says well, Dr. Chasen tried to do intact and he failed so, so there was really nothing to say about this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.991" offset="13516273">But the fact is, if this law went into effect, no woman could have intact D&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.628" offset="13538843">So even though, even in those cases where Dr. Chasen was able to do intact D&amp;E, he would no longer be able to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.282" offset="13565384">So the incidence of those women having catastrophic health consequences, which in the Chasen study, three of the women having D&amp;Es had catastrophic health consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.106" offset="13604672">Inevitably if this law is upheld, an intact D&amp;E is not available as an option to doctors when in their judgment based on substantial medical authority, it's the best option for the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.481" offset="13658171">Inevitably there will be more and more women having D&amp;Es and suffering catastrophic health consequences in situations where if intact D&amp;E had been available, those catastrophic consequences could have been averted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3399.696" offset="13751062">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.415" offset="13765900">A few final points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.917" offset="13771960">First of all, I don't think the constitutionality of Congress's act depends on whether the anatomical landmark is the navel or up to the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.187" offset="13801008">Congress, as everyone recognizes, had to draw a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.641" offset="13814905">I think drawing the line at more than halfway out is a pretty good place to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.277" offset="13833400">Second, my learned cocounsel is certainly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.229" offset="13845207">This is a preenforcement challenge, in response to your question, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.282" offset="13861403">But the point is, this is a preenforcement facial challenge, and if the Court rejects it and allows this statute to go into operation, it will not foreclose the possibility of a future preenforcement as applied challenge that focuses on particular medical conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.058" offset="13924515">That's not something, though, that one can reach in this record, because as the district court in this case found at 147a, there is no specific condition here in which the D&amp;X procedure is particularly ready met for or otherwise is medically necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.084" offset="13984597">Rather, the claims in this case are that it's always better.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.686" offset="13999016">That's what some doctors say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.070" offset="14004554">It's a heterodox position, it's not the majority position, but it's not focussed on specific situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.606" offset="14026706">The other thing it's not focused on, and this is in reference to something that Justice Breyer mentioned, it's not focused on emergencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.279" offset="14057426">Another thing that the district court noted at page 128a of its opinion is that the D&amp;E procedure and the D&amp;X procedure, neither of them are particularly good in dealing with true medical emergencies where time is of the essence, because both these procedures require substantial advance time to do the dilation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.507" offset="14126285">And since the D&amp;X procedure requires more dilation, I actually think in an emergency, you'd probably end up performing the D&amp;E procedure if you performed either one, because you'd need less time for the dilation in an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.780" offset="14171424">The other thing I should point out is that, of course, there is this question about what's a significant risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.433" offset="14193994">And one thing about the lethal injection at the beginning of the process, the Digoxin injection or the potassium chloride injection, is the other side concedes that the mother gets to make the choice as to whether or not to do that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.926" offset="14244045">Well, Dr. Carhart does it as a matter of course after 17 weeks, and I certainly don't think anyone would suggest that Dr. Carhart is needlessly inflicting significant risks on his patients by following that regimen in every case after 17 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.334" offset="14301619">And I think it's worth noting that the legal regime that respondents would construct is a legal regime where the woman can decide whether or not to have that shot, Dr. Carhart can decide it for her and that's okay, but Congress can't make the same judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.493" offset="14358252">But it's important to draw a line here, and say that fetal demise that takes place in utero is one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.397" offset="14381867">That is abortion as it has always been understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.932" offset="14395973">But this procedure, the banned procedure is something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.301" offset="14409452">This is not about fetal demise in utero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.669" offset="14418961">This is something that is far too close to infanticide for society to tolerate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.488" offset="14438291">Thank you.</text>
