            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="9.272" offset="193631">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.058" offset="204812">The pivotal question in this case is whether this Court's decisions in Gordon and NASD require implied antitrust immunity as the district court believed.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.764" offset="247653">And we submit that the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.466" offset="258415">The '33 and '34 acts were of course passed for the very purpose of regulating IPOs and alleged market manipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.404" offset="290180">And this Court has referred to these laws as the anchor of Federal economic policy in the securities field.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.391" offset="314108">And under these laws the SEC has laid down detailed regulations applicable to the very practices that are at issue in this case with active supervision by the SEC and the NASD.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.282" offset="361755">And it has done this with full understanding that syndicated underwriting is inherently concerted action.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.869" offset="388087">An underwriting requires joint action in accumulating information and setting the price of the offering along with allotting shares to customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.808" offset="427793">Now the Gordon and NASD cases apply directly here because of the danger of inconsistency and conflict which the SEC cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.114" offset="465096">As in cases of this Court in the past, like NASD and Gordon and later Trinko, Congress required this expert administrative agency to take competition into account when issuing its standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.507" offset="518595">And review in antitrust courts across the country would once again raise the danger of false positives and conflicts and wasteful redundancy.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="98.780" offset="551718">Did it, did it specifically state that, or is it that or just the principle that all Federal agencies have an obligation to--</text>

            <text syncTime="104.916" offset="576273">Oh, no, Your Honor, it is very express in 75 and then again in the 96.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.201" offset="589439">Capital formation, investor protection and competition have to be weighed against each other by the SEC, and in Gordon this Court attached great importance to that standard, which differs from the competition first standard of, the antitrust laws impose.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.799" offset="787760">And are we to assume that if the allegations are true, which they of course may not be, that this is a violation of the... of the securities laws?</text>

            <text syncTime="168.704" offset="831437">And they draw very fine lines in this area, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.908" offset="852231">And if, in fact, the SEC concludes it is a tie-in under its finely calibrated standards, then yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.396" offset="874173">But that's the critical issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.681" offset="883264">It is very easy to term these things excessive compensation or tie-ins, but when the NASD looked at a real complaint of this sort in the Invemed case it found that there was no excessive compensation and no commercial bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.405" offset="934255">And--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="194.921" offset="936240">How about in this case Did the SEC examine that question at all in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="200.725" offset="959542">And did it take any position?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="202.511" offset="966647">--In this case it took no position on the merit of the underlying claims, but it said that there would be serious problems if antitrust law were applied to these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.617" offset="1003009">It would interfere with the agency's ability to define what is manipulation and to amend its definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.937" offset="1028296">It has ongoing rulemaking proceedings right now addressed to this issue; and it said further that it would discourage underwriters from going up to the line of prohibition, which is very important in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.994" offset="1076570">Because if they don't step over the line and they engage in book building conversations, that's critical to setting the right price for the IPO.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.639" offset="4039169">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="973.425" offset="4050245">The United States has responsibility for enforcing both the securities laws through the SEC and the antitrust laws through the Justice Department and the FTC.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.780" offset="4087757">It thus has a critical interest in ensuring that these laws can be reconciled in a manner that gives effect to both, and completely ousts neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.136" offset="4121089">Any effort to try to reconcile those laws in the specific context of the underwriting of IPOs has to begin with an understanding of the particular regulatory context and scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.092" offset="4164975">The SEC obviously carefully regulates both the registration and the underwriting process for individual IPOs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.181" offset="4193292">There are two aspects of that regulatory regime that are particularly important: First, the approval for all sorts of collaborative conduct that is the hallmark of the underwriting syndicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.655" offset="4239163">And second, the very fine nature of the distinctions that the SEC draws between permissible book building activity and impermissible market manipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.694" offset="4279391">And in that regulatory context, the kind of collaborative conduct that would in many other contexts raise yellow or red flags of an antitrust violation is innocuous, because it's a hallmark of the underwriting process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.204" offset="4333413">Equally important, the SEC does make certain conduct like tie-ins and laddering unlawful, but very closely related conduct is not only permissible, but is considered beneficial to the capital formation process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.338" offset="4441978">And I think as a practical matter, if these kind of things were disclosed, they probably wouldn't happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.864" offset="4500074">It's not just a disclosure approach, and it does say that there's conduct that is forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.900" offset="4520240">But I think it is important to recognize just how fine the lines that are drawn here become, because, to give you a real world example, the guidance document that's at page 216A of the petition appendix makes clear that it is permissible for the lead underwriter, when talking to customers, to gauge their interest at various price points in the initial offering.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.906" offset="4652211">Well, I think if you were looking at a challenge that took place solely within the context of a single IPO, it would probably be so difficult that I think we would concede that you can't practically separate the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.595" offset="4694947">What I think is important from the standpoint of the Justice Department and its antitrust responsibilities is you don't want to sweep an immunity so broad that it would, say, give cover to a conspiracy that cut across IPOs, and was an effort to fix commission rates, or to make territorial agreements, or exclude a rival investment bank from the underwriting process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.093" offset="4992952">We are certainly sensitive to the threat that a regulatory agency is trying to draw a fine line between two closely related areas of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.866" offset="5028061">They're not going to be able to enforce that line as a practical matter if the regulated community knows that the consequence of having a foot fault in crossing that line will be treble damages in a class action suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.554" offset="5070797">On the other hand, we would caution against adopting some sort of broad immunity that would preclude, say, the Justice Department from investigating and prosecuting an antitrust conspiracy that cut across--</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.279" offset="5117713">And of course, the Congress has addressed the problem of treble damages directly in a number of areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.533" offset="5142686">And I suppose, if they were to address the area in the antitrust context, they might draw a distinction between private treble damages suits and Government enforcement efforts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.328" offset="5413942">I mean, if you're worried about taking authority from the Department to prosecute territorial restrictions as some kind of blatant price fix, that's not in front of us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.364" offset="5534000">Maybe protected here, because they have thought about it, but there will be a lot of cases where the SEC hasn't thought about the particular conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.931" offset="5640266">And I should note, that's basically the line this Court drew in NASD.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.085" offset="5656880">If you look particularly at the part of the decision that deals with count 1 of the Government's complaint, that was a horizontal allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.305" offset="5685824">And it was all in the context of vertical agreements that were specific to a particular mutual fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.493" offset="5710588">And in that context, this Court said that with respect to the horizontal agreement, there's nothing in the SEC regulations that specifically addresses that, but the SEC specifically blesses the vertical agreements, so we're going to give additional immunity to that horizontal agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.568" offset="5766908">That same page, page 733 of the opinion, they say, what we don't have before us is an allegation by the government that there is a scheme here to reduce competition between mutual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.793" offset="5815809">There is no allegation that they were trying to cut down, there was an agreement that would cut down competition between Fidelity and Wellington, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.966" offset="5844440">It was all in the context of individual funds and retarding the secondary market for individual funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.370" offset="5866069">The language the Court used on page 733 of that opinion seems to us a perfectly reasonable test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.440" offset="5890311">The Court said, quote: SEC had prohibited in the vertical context and what was sought to be gone after in the context of the horizontal restraints, those are too closely related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.081" offset="5944959">I don't think that test has caused the undue confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.866" offset="5960005">And I think what it does it makes a reasonable balance between a ruling that on the one hand preserves a great deal of immunity, but on the other hand doesn't give a kind of blanket immunity that would basically completely oust the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.210" offset="14245419">The test was whether it was connected to the SEC's regulatory responsibilities and the SEC could deal with that sort of concerted action on an industrywide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.466" offset="14282409">Now, Mr. Lovell has argued that the conduct has always been forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.870" offset="14300067">He labels it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.487" offset="14306546">There are many case from this Court that we cite in our reply brief holding that that labeling does not defeat immunity because it's always possible to characterize conduct in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.678" offset="14347297">But the agency has to apply its expertise to decide what is forbidden and to change its rules over time, which the SEC is now doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.031" offset="14380733">And it has to be able to prevent, deterring conduct that comes up to the line of prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.252" offset="14401631">Here that conduct is essential to protect investors and to protect issuers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.723" offset="14419499">The markets couldn't function efficiently if underwriters could not engage freely in the kinds of conversations that get twisted in this litigation into something characterized as tie-ins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.095" offset="14460982">Now, there are 310 private suits now pending under the securities laws brought by many of these same lawyers, making the same claims of concerted action to manipulate the stock market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.470" offset="14502464">Those suits are subject to a panoply of safeguards that Congress has prescribed, including single damages, restrictions on class action abuse, serious loss causation requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.110" offset="14549066">The only purpose for stretching the antitrust laws here is to evade all of the safeguards that Congress has passed, each and every one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.098" offset="14576965">We think NASD and Gordon are very important in preventing that kind of a pleading tactic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.518" offset="14598699">And of course, when counsel talks about concerted action and manipulating the stock market, what did Congress pass the '34 Act for if it wasn't that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.958" offset="14636420">There were extensive hearings about concerted manipulation involving pools and groups that were manipulating the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.528" offset="14662751">That's why there are several anti-manipulation provisions in the '34 Act that give Power to define the misconduct and to deal with it effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.383" offset="14698173">And this is the toughest cop in Washington, the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.252" offset="14709563">They're perfectly capable of dealing with this.</text>
