            <text syncTime="24.396" offset="243877">In the uniform and constant tradition of Federal criminal sentencing, the district judge in this case treated Mario Claiborne as an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.992" offset="278254">She considered the guidelines and after doing so turned to the judgment that 3553(a) demands in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.639" offset="316915">She issued a sentence to avoid unwarranted disparity, to impose just punishment, and to ensure that deterrence did not throw away Mario Claiborne's chances to resume his responsibilities to himself, to his family, and to his community.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.341" offset="387655">The court of appeals, in contrast to the district court's careful attention to the 3553(a) factors, focused solely on the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.637" offset="432899">The court of appeals applied its extraordinary circumstances rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.203" offset="651178">And there is necessarily a tension between the individualized sentencing that 3553(a) requires and concerns about nationwide uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.700" offset="689108">But I think that what distinguishes sentencing under the advisory guidelines system from the Presentencing Reform Act system are several.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.735" offset="729232">One is now we explicitly have purposes of sentencing and factors the judge must consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.428" offset="6680030">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.941" offset="6694137">This Court in Booker concluded that the remedial severing of the statute's provision for mandatory application of the guidelines and a provision governing the standards of review on appeal rendered the statute constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.551" offset="6760592">It further implied a standard of review of reasonableness of guideline sentences on appeal, and it did not elaborate what that reasonableness requirement means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.437" offset="6804060">The Government submits that the best interpretation of a reasonableness form of review would be one that conforms as closely as it can to Congress's original intent of minimizing and eliminating unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly situated defendants.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1685.622" offset="6888801">As closely as it can, and the "as it can" depends upon violation of the Sixth Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.485" offset="6972288">Suppose in this case the court of appeals instead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.301" offset="7003531">And then in the next case that comes up involving what was the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of cocaine powder rather than crack, okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.593" offset="7068732">Suppose in the next case it would have been 30 grams of powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.915" offset="7094019">And the district court judge once again departs just the way the departure was here, and the court of appeals says no, that departure is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.982" offset="7138218">You now have circuit law which says 30 grams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams, you're entitled to a lesser sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.014" offset="7194434">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.513" offset="7200390">Why isn't... why haven't we fallen back into the same problem that produced Booker/Fanfan?</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.769" offset="7229438">You have fact findings being made by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.691" offset="7241141">It's a judge who decides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.563" offset="7260576">What difference does it make whether that factual difference produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a series of opinion by a court of appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.654" offset="7324941">Isn't the Sixth Amendment equally violated?</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.326" offset="7335599">Justice Scalia, as I think we talked about in the last argument, in theory it could be if this Court concludes that judicial determinations on appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a commission or statute, and if what the court of appeals does is essentially function as a sentencing commission, literally prescribing particular levels of punishment for recurring sets of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.143" offset="7446881">The Government's submission here is not that the court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a proportionality principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.749" offset="7477288">A proportionality principle will look to all of the facts of the case and will try to get a handle on, is this a reasonable sentence in response to all of the facts and circumstances that the judge articulated within--</text>

            <text syncTime="1847.740" offset="7537265">But if you have two cases that are in other respects similar, and the court of appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.205" offset="7639142">--Well, he doesn't, Justice Scalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same level of leniency or any leniency at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.963" offset="7682192">That judge will retain the judge's classic discretion to look at the totality of the facts and conclude whether a sentence that would be below the range is a reasonable sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.360" offset="7727750">And unlike a situation that some of us might prefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that like cases are treated with reasonable consistency, the system of reasonableness review on top of advisory guidelines will not produce perfect levels of consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.703" offset="7813118">And what the defendant is entitled to under the Sixth Amendment rulings of this Court is knowing that if the law says if I commit this crime and these are the facts that support it, my level of sentence is this and no higher, that any higher sentence that's produced by a fact finding gives him a jury trial entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.529" offset="7904442">That's what the Sixth Amendment entitles you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.529" offset="7912488">But no defendant who commits a crack offense can say that even after a series of court of appeals rulings that mark out various points of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.187" offset="7951044">That defendant will not know whether the judge that he or she appears in front of will give the same kind of weight to those facts as some other judge did who was affirmed or reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.924" offset="7998065">Nor will that judge be able to say what is the constellation of policy and factual reasons that this particular judge will find in announcing the judge's sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.990" offset="8042264">So I don't think that a proportionality principle runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.873" offset="8061804">And I don't think that it runs afoul of anything in 3553(a) or any other part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.156" offset="8082910">What the Court is left with is the task of interpreting reasonableness, and I submit it should ask the same question that it asked in Booker itself: Which alternative, the Petitioner's alternative in this case or the Government's, conforms more closely to Congress's original claim in the Sentencing Reform Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.140" offset="8158875">The Petitioner's version of appellate review as I understand it is very light review, if at all, of the substance of what the district judge does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.466" offset="8196177">It may reach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a second degree murderer, I think probation is the appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.394" offset="8235884">Perhaps the Petitioner would concede that that would be arbitrary and irrational; but beyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to arise that Petitioner can feel free to give it away, Petitioner gives the Court nothing, and gives the courts of appeals nothing to apply standards to determine whether a particular sentence is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.466" offset="8320207">And that is what the court of appeals have been reaching for when eight of them have adopted this proportionality principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2108.488" offset="8580282">But I don't agree that that distinction would support a two-track form of appellate review that would give the district judge greater deference to take personal characteristics into account and to impose widely varying sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.448" offset="8640155">That is exactly the situation that we had in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era when any district judge could choose whatever policies of sentencing appeal to that judge, find the facts, and impose a widely disparate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.627" offset="8700863">And as the Court well knows, there was no appellate review of that exercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the judge didn't exercise discretion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.204" offset="8739106">Now it is not an exercise of discretion if a judge simply says for this crime, I always give the same sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.178" offset="8767005">That would not take into account the full range of facts and factors that are present in the sentencing court and as a result, that wouldn't be an exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.765" offset="8805353">But in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era, the judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what facts mattered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.903" offset="12125934">And when you're talking about a defendant whose mandatory minimum sentence would have been 5 years, but who gets out of that sentence because he satisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is a first-time offender and meets certain other requirements to get a sentence under the mandatory minimum, that defendant's culpability had already been substantially reduced under the guidelines because of the safety valve and because of his criminal history.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.111" offset="12718809">His statutory maximum is 20 years and I'm going to give him, maybe not the statutory maximum, I'm going to give him an 18-year sentence, or suppose she said a 15-year sentence or a 10-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.108" offset="12766770">I submit that in that circumstances the Petitioner would be here saying, well, the guidelines recommended a sentence of between 37 and 46 months and this is a dramatic increase from that and the reason is not something that's particularly unusual, it's a very usual reason, and as a result, the magnitude of this deviation is unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.430" offset="13012008">Justice Scalia, I don't think that the courts of appeals are, at least absent very unusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.206" offset="13055162">There have been a couple of instances where courts of appeals have said this is really the bottom sentence that we can see that would be reasonable on this particular constellation of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.982" offset="13090270">I think that reflect as sense of potential impatience with a ping-pong game that would occur if the court of appeals says your sentence is unreasonable, Mr. District Judge, and the district judge imposes a sentence that's one day lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.010" offset="13142411">Another solution to that problem would be reassignment to a different judge who would start with a clean slate and could read the court of appeals' opinion and apply the section 3553 factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.137" offset="13186924">We are not suggesting that the court of appeals should assume the sentencing role here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.680" offset="13209075">All we're suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to have some intelligible legal principles that allow it to identify and select unreasonable sentences versus reasonable sentences; and when you have wide statutory ranges as you do in the Federal system, if you don't have the guidelines describing at least a benchmark, it's not more, then I don't think courts of appeals have a good, coherent, consistent way of fulfilling their tasks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.451" offset="13328089">And if the courts of appeals can do that, can look more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the farther that it goes outside the guidelines range, without violating the statute and without violating the Constitution, then it seems to me the only thing for the Court to ask at that point is which approach, that approach of proportionality, or and approach that basically says appellate review is procedural only, absent the most glaringly aberrant sentences, conforms to Congress's intent of producing a greater degree of uniformity and consistency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.912" offset="13466016">Well, it wouldn't be, just be procedural only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.975" offset="13474270">You... you could say procedural plus, you know, certainly review of the facts on, on which the district court was... was proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.151" offset="13518992">So you, if you could find that the determination that this was just a good kid who made a mistake is, is an unreasonable finding, you could reverse for that reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.049" offset="13630483">But I don't see how you reach that judgment assuming that the court has articulated a rationale that's consistent with section 3553 and a rational interpretation of the facts, unless you have the guidelines as an anchor for the analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.324" offset="13775619">The court of appeals spoke of it as extraordinary variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.007" offset="13790352">And the Government doesn't suggest to us that substantial means the same thing or means something different from extraordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.060" offset="13814594">And we've already demonstrated in our brief why relying on percentages as the court of appeals also did, is pointless, because, one, if... the arithmetic gets very complicated at the low end and the percentages just don't make any sense from a proper application of a rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.212" offset="13887214">The Government's proposal, apart from having no basis in the statute and no basis in Booker, is just not susceptible of any kind of application because nobody really knows what it means.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.022" offset="14014378">And I think the absence of a prior record, the young man's work history, all of those factors, the low amount of crack cocaine involved, his age, all of the things which as Justice Ginsburg pointed out that judge relied on in her sentencing decision, could not possibly support a 10-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.415" offset="14092014">And you know, it is easy to do this in a, in a hypothetical sort of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.539" offset="14116465">But the district judge... and this was a very experienced district judge... looking at the person in the eye, made a call based on judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.136" offset="14146871">And that call was not treated with any respect in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.168" offset="14171008">It was sloganeered away as an extraordinary variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.941" offset="14186055">And... because the court of appeals focused only on the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.722" offset="14201206">The... this Court in crafting the appellate standard can't just look to determine what Congress might have intended because of the constitutional problem that lurks behind it.</text>
