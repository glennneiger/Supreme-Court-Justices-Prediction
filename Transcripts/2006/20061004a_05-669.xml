            <text syncTime="11.319" offset="195881">Section 2415(a) established a limitations period for every action for money damages by the Government which is founded on any contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.703" offset="233393">That provision, by its terms, applies to every contract action, every adversary adjudication seeking monetary compensation for breach, whether pursued before a court or an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.882" offset="278115">The contention that every action encompasses only civil actions or judicial actions is incorrect for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.646" offset="305177">First, it is inconsistent with the broad language that Congress used.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.199" offset="323359">It is inconsistent with the statutory structure, in that it renders another provision, the exception for administrative offset, totally superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.263" offset="351675">It also creates an irrationality in the hierarchy of the Government's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.469" offset="372469">Finally, it robs Section 2415(a) of its intended effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.221" offset="391486">Turning to the text, Congress and agencies regularly use the term "action" to refer to adversary adjudications before administrative agencies and before the judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="72.398" offset="440178">--May I ask you, on that point... I understand what you're saying, and I've looked at your authority, but, right in the provision itself, there is a verbal distinction made between actions for money damages, and what, at the end of the provision, they refer to as 1-year supplementary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.553" offset="524815">Doesn't the statute, in effect, say,</text>
            <text syncTime="96.685" offset="537354">"We don't mean, by "action", what we would possibly... what possibly might be included as an administrative proceeding? "</text>
            <text syncTime="105.900" offset="574134">If they had wanted an administrative proceeding to be a subset of the actions for money damages, wouldn't it have been sensible for Congress to say in... to refer, instead of to "administrative proceedings", to "administrative actions"?</text>

            <text syncTime="124.272" offset="647695">And that clause applies in the particular circumstance where a law or a contract requires some sort of administrative proceeding as a condition precedent to the action for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.750" offset="689595">So, if you can bring your money-damages action without any prior administrative proceeding, regardless of where you bring--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="139.782" offset="709762">I think your point has to be that there are administrative proceedings that are not actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.490" offset="760544">So, the distinction the statute draws is not between money-damages actions in court and money... damages actions before agencies; it's before money-damages actions, wherever brought, and the administrative proceedings that have to be brought as a condition precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.227" offset="4663447">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.608" offset="4673060">The presumption is that the Government is not bound by a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.522" offset="4688629">And, when read as a whole, Section 2415(a) does not overcome that presumption, but instead makes clear that it applies only to suits in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.559" offset="4720812">There are several reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.369" offset="4728021">First, the ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms refer to suits in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.181" offset="4747352">Second, the statute expressly distinguishes between administrative proceedings and actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.673" offset="4769295">Third the statute's located in the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.698" offset="4781416">Fourth, the committee reports, for those who are inclined to consider them, strongly support the statute's ordinary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.399" offset="4804195">And, fifth, even if some administrative proceedings were governed by Section 2415(a), these would not, because they do not involve a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.726" offset="4841497">Now, on the first of those points, the term 7 years ago, in West v. Gibson, every member of this Court agreed that the term "action" often refers only to suits in court, and not to administrative proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.608" offset="4921014">And there are a number of instances cited by the Petitioner that... where this Court and... and statutes use the term in context where it clearly applies to administrative proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.438" offset="4980364">So, the question is, How... you know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to administrative proceedings in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.506" offset="5020593">And I find it pretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it way, that there is effectively no statute of limitations whatever for the Government in these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.815" offset="5069808">--Well, the structure of the law here is that in those instances where Congress does authorize administrative recovery, it ordinarily provides a context-specific administrative limitations period, such as in the Contract Disputes Act, which governs almost all of the contract claims the Government can pursue administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.783" offset="5129680">Congress specifically enacted a 6-year limitations period for the submission of a claim to a contracting officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.467" offset="5152459">In this unique context, however, Congress had very good reasons for not applying a limitations period until it prospectively enacted a partial one in 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.202" offset="5183388">The reason is that what Congress found here, in context of mineral leasing, based on the findings of an independent commission, was that the companies were historically on an honors system and had abused that by underpaying royalties of up to half a billion dollars annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.601" offset="5233021">So, what Congress directed the agency to do is to audit all current and past lease accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.372" offset="5252038">One of the committee reports said to focus on old accounts, because this was a Congress that was not concerned with repose, but with getting some of those vast underpayments back from the companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1310.965" offset="5394457">Also, when Congress was telling the agency to focus on old accounts, it certainly wasn't thinking that a statute of limitations applied to that, and the agency, in that contemporary context, did not understand that there was a limitations period, either, because the orders that issued in the aftermath of the 1982 Act went back 7, 8, 9, sometimes more, years than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.541" offset="5544714">And if I could explain that, an administrative offset occurs in the situation... this is what OLC was looking at... where the Government, by statute, owed retirement benefits to a person, and, because it thought that person owed it money, what the Government did was to unilaterally reduce the retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.179" offset="5599257">What OLC opined is that that is a... nothing more than a prejudgment attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.142" offset="5619110">And OLC thought that if the Government is time-barred from obtaining a judgment, it should be time-barred from obtaining a prejudgment attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.357" offset="5643979">An administrative adjudication is significantly different, because it does provide an actual judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.642" offset="5665190">So, there are a couple of important points from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.284" offset="5675744">First is that the dispute between OLC and the Comptroller General was limited by its terms to administrative offsets, although, Justice Stevens, the Comptroller General did opine beyond that, that the statute specifically applies only to suits in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.431" offset="5724332">But the actual dispute was as to administrative offsets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.433" offset="5740319">So, when Congress addressed that specific dispute, as Justice Alito pointed out, it resolved only that specific dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1411.234" offset="5795489">I mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which you're urging here, which is that this statute applies only to judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.121" offset="5835091">I mean, that's the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.660" offset="5841256">Whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position taken by the Justice Department was that this statute relates to administrative proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.263" offset="6099659">If that's the case, then timing should have nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.288" offset="6119721">Conversely, as Justice Scalia said, if timing does have something to do with it, timing presumably derives from this provision; this provision, therefore, must have been assumed to apply to administrative proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.506" offset="6448655">The point's just... the OLC reasoning was admittedly somewhat odd, but that was the context in which Congress was responding to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.983" offset="6486480">And, going forward, it is not surplusage, because the issue still arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.768" offset="6505706">If the Government could pursue its suit only in court, it would be time-barred from pursuing a suit in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.119" offset="6523052">The question would then still arise, under the OLC opinion, unless it had been overruled, whether the Government could, nonetheless, obtain a prejudgment attachment, even though it cannot obtain judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.716" offset="6561399">That's all that Congress was looking at there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.686" offset="6569341">And, as this Court's recognized in cases like O'Gilvie and Vonn, when Congress amends a statue to resolve a specific dispute, oftentimes its amendments should be read as doing no more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.413" offset="6600270">We... I agree, though, that terms... to get back to the beginning of this discussion... terms do not always have their ordinary meanings, but they presumptively do, especially when a statute must be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.230" offset="6643528">And here, the context confirms that "action" does have its ordinary meaning, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.941" offset="6662337">First, the ordinary meanings of the other key statutory terms, such as "right of action", "complaint", and "defendant", as Justice Ginsberg pointed out, all ordinarily refer to aspects of suits in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.818" offset="6701834">A "right of action" is the right to bring a suit in court; a "defendant" is the person defending in court ordinarily; and a "complaint" is the document that initiates proceedings by stating a claim that's seeking relief in a civil action, which is a suit in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.828" offset="6761915">Especially when those terms are used together, this Court recognized, in Unexcelled Chemical, that a reference to commencing a action by filing a complaint ordinarily refers to filing a suit in court, not a pleading before an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.188" offset="6819385">The statute then goes on to expressly juxtapose an action against an administrative proceeding by saying that the time to file an action does not run until after the administrative proceedings have concluded, which certainly gives weight to the point that the action is... an administrative proceeding is not an action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.597" offset="6972985">I think the reason is that... I mean, historically, administrative... obviously, court suits have been around a lot longer than administrative adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.888" offset="6998167">And, as Congress has authorized administrative adjudications, it's dealt with them on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.324" offset="7019901">And every time that it enacted a context-specific administrative adjudications period since 1966... in theory, it could have just done an across-the-board one for all agency adjudications, but, instead, it's chosen to deal with the context-specific; in part, because of the great variety of administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.064" offset="7078833">I mean, as this case illustrates, a statute of limitations that governs a complaint in an action is just not going to work in a lot of administrative contexts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.273" offset="8587666">But there's no... and, as a practical matter... I mean, because the Government bears the initial burden of going forward, if the company destroys the sources of proof, that's, on balance, going to be in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.429" offset="8624341">But, in addition, there's not a strict congruence between the 6-year periods, because, first, the companies only have to keep records for 6 years, but, in some circumstances, the Secretary can require they be kept for longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.616" offset="8669063">In addition, sometimes the statute of limitations, because of tolling, is much longer than 6 years; and so, the lawful destruction of records would still leave absence-of-proof issues in situations where the statute might, because of tolling, be much longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.605" offset="8713053">So, there's not a strict congruence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.554" offset="8716815">There is also no indication that Congress enacted the 6-year records-retention policy because it was thinking about a 6-year limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.429" offset="8744296">There's never been any linkage between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.919" offset="8750252">If I could briefly cover, then, also... I mean, in addition to all the textual points, this is also located in the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.073" offset="8782853">And, although it's true that a couple stray provisions in the judicial code apply to administrative proceedings, they say that expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.480" offset="8812528">Every time the word "action" is used in the judicial code... and Petitioners identified no examples... every time the word "action" is used in the judicial code, it refers to a suit in court, and only a suit in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.156" offset="8851189">When a provision of the judicial code applies to something else, it will say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.137" offset="8867176">For example, 28 U.S. Code 2462, which is a statute of limitations for penalty proceedings, refers to an</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.953" offset="8894448">"action, suit, or proceeding. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.833" offset="8901866">The Federal Tort Claims Act is very clear that what it's talking about is submitting something to an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.128" offset="8923078">So, if Congress was going to legislate against the backdrop of a strict construction canon with terms that ordinarily refer to suits in court, and put the provision in the judicial code, I mean, that just is a totally irrational way of expressing intent, especially clear... especially a clear intent, when it's trying to govern administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.640" offset="8993190">The committee reports also strongly confirm that, because they not only say that the statute defines the time limitation for bringing an action in the U.S. courts, and not only use court terminology from front to back, they also say, like the statute, that they're aware of the administrative proceedings, but what they're saying is that the time to bring an action in the courts does not expire until after the conclusion of those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.334" offset="9075946">The committee has explained that the reason for that provision was the great number and variety of administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.278" offset="9099666">So, in other words, Congress was saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.356" offset="9104054">"There's a great variety of administrative procedure. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.787" offset="9113772">"We're just not going to deal with that here. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.349" offset="9119937">"We're taking it off the table by saying this limitations period does not expire until a year after those administrative proceedings, whatever they might be, have expired. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.084" offset="9150970">There's also some relevance in the fact that this legislation was proposed by the Justice Department as part of an overall package of reforms that would govern the civil litigation that the Department was handling in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.131" offset="9191094">It was then referred to the Judiciary Committees, not to the House Government Reform Committees that might consider administrative procedure matters, and, as I mentioned before, was enacted as part of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.009" offset="9230591">From start to finish, this legislation has never had anything to do with anything other than court suits, which is why Congress has expressly provided for context-specific administrative systems... limitations periods... which make sense in the context of the relevant administrative procedures.</text>

I don't do it bite by bite; you look at the whole text... and, when you read all this stuff together, it seems to me that the import of (i) is that administrative proceedings, despite the fact that "action" is not a very common word to use for them, are covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.374" offset="10600035">And that's, first, that Congress directed the agency to establish a comprehensive auditing and collection system, and then gave the agency administrative authority to enforce its administrative orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.347" offset="10671924">Congress has not only authorized that, and ratified it, it has strengthened that scheme and told the agency, as I said, in 1982, to go back and look at old leases, precisely because Congress knew that is a standalone administrative scheme, and it's never provided the administrative limitations period for the standalone administrative scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="3098.558" offset="12544799">And so, Congress often takes exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.541" offset="12552740">And when it modified the Mineral Leasing Act of 1996, that was an exception to the 2415 regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.445" offset="12576355">So, Congress knows how to conduct specialized situations and take things outside of 2415 when it needs to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.020" offset="12602686">But it enacted Section 2415 as a catchall for all of those situations where Congress hadn't managed to anticipate the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.383" offset="12624106">And the Government's premise of the whole provision is that Congress botched it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.209" offset="12651378">Congress provided a catchall that catches judicial actions, but leaves the Government free, in perpetuity, to persist... to proceed on precisely the same claims for precisely the same relief, plus interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.946" offset="12694324">And, because interest is calculated at a relatively high rate, that makes those old claims much, much more valuable than the relatively more recent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.731" offset="12725461">And it seems implausible to think that Congress enacted a catchall limitations period with a loophole so large that it deprives the statute of limitations period of effect almost entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.430" offset="12768302">Finally, I'd like to say, one moment about the statute... the canon of strict construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.861" offset="12790036">And that is that it doesn't always require the court to narrow otherwise broad statutory language, particularly where doing so would have the effect of rendering another provision... here, subsection (i) is superfluous... introducing anomalies into the statutory structure and depriving the statute of its intended effect, as the Bowers case we cite in our reply brief on page 16 makes clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.195" offset="12875404">And Bowers case was virtually on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.867" offset="12886062">It was the case where the... it was a statute of limitations that could have applied to administrative agency actions, or it could not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.712" offset="12913439">And the Court declined to accept a narrowing construction proffered by the Government under statute of strict construction because it would have rendered one of the provisions... one for consent proceedings... superfluous, because it would have resulted in anomaly, and because it would have undermined the premise of repose which undergirded the statute of limitations in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.405" offset="12992224">Precisely the same things are true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.638" offset="13001106">And, for those reasons, the Court should reach precisely the same result.</text>
