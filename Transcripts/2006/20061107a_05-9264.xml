            <text syncTime="6.686" offset="178455">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.434" offset="189531">We confront today the Eleventh Circuit's troubling interpretation of the otherwise clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.213" offset="216594">Under the text and structure of the act, as well as the categorical approach that this Court recognized in Shepard and Taylor, Florida attempted burglary convictions should not qualify as they... these types of convictions do not involve explicitly, implicitly or even inherently, a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.203" offset="308545">The Respondent in their brief has enunciated a test to determine whether a conviction should qualify, and that test that they enunciate is basically a district court judge or a sentencing judge uses their common sense and experience to determine whether an offense should qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.352" offset="393181">That type of test is not the kind of test that this Court enunciated in Taylor and Shepard when it looked at the very elemental approach at determining whether convictions should qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.986" offset="443754">The categorical approach that this Court enunciated refers to predicate offenses in terms not of prior conduct but of prior convictions and the elements of those crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.733" offset="482729">As such, the Government's argument would open up a... is a broad mandate that courts could use to bring in almost any type of crime, any kind of felony to be included within the Armed Career Criminal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.336" offset="545110">For instance, simple possession of cocaine is a third-degree felony in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.520" offset="573844">It's a five-year statutory maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.191" offset="584502">Under the serious drug offense that Congress enumerated, it would only qualify if it had a 10-year statutory maximum and it involved the distribution of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.874" offset="627239">Yet, if the Government's approach to the interpretation of the otherwise clause is to be used, that simple possession of cocaine could qualify if a judge using their common sense and everyday experience determines it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.039" offset="695888">Obviously--</text>

            <text syncTime="136.601" offset="698187">If we were looking at attempted generic burglary of a residence, wouldn't that involve conduct that presents the serious potential risk of physical injury to another?</text>

            <text syncTime="146.753" offset="738729">--Your Honor, in Taylor, this Court was clear that under enumerated burglary or generic burglary, the offense becomes a... has that serious potential risk when the person actually enters the dwelling or enters the structure; and under an attempted burglary, at least in Florida and in most other States, that act has not occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.465" offset="821590">You haven't entered, the defendant has not entered the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.821" offset="835069">If the would-be burglar is climbing through the window or on a ladder with the intent to climb through the window, wouldn't that involve almost the same risk or maybe the same risk?</text>

            <label>Mr. Craig L. Crawford</label>
            <text syncTime="182.317" offset="881044">If the conduct... again, we're looking at, then, a fact-based inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.393" offset="905286">Obviously, some attempted burglaries could get that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.813" offset="918974">Other attempted burglaries are caught well before that actually occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.062" offset="936006">But if you were to say that the attempted burglary was climbing up a ladder trying to get into the place and the person actually didn't get in, again, under Taylor, it says the risk is when the person enters.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.586" offset="990132">The risk is much less outside the dwelling than inside the dwelling.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="213.351" offset="1005178">But in Florida, that would be burglary itself, right, because it covers the curtilage around the house?</text>

            <label>Mr. Craig L. Crawford</label>
            <text syncTime="220.083" offset="1032137">The curtilage is a unique concept, I guess in Florida, in that the curtilage is the enclosed space around the house that has some kind of enclosure, whether by fence or whether by bushes.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.751" offset="1078739">So if the place was enclosed and you had a ladder going up to the residence, that would actually be a burglary within the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.060" offset="1107996">In other States, it may not.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.857" offset="1115206">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.465" offset="1117609">And we don't even have to ask whether that presents a serious potential risk under the statute, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="248.228" offset="1144672">Because, if burglary is identified as... a predicate offense without the need to resort to the definition?</text>

            <label>Mr. Craig L. Crawford</label>
            <text syncTime="258.053" offset="1183960">Well, it would be a burglary in the State of Florida, but under the test enunciated in Taylor, it wouldn't qualify because Taylor was very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.908" offset="1219382">It is the entering a dwelling or structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.626" offset="1230249">And in Florida, you could be guilty of a burglary without entering a structure or dwelling, just like in a curtilage burglary.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.373" offset="1261283">Well, you could do it in a noncurtilage burglary State simply by putting the ladder up to the window and getting on the first rung of the ladder.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.714" offset="1294615">I mean, you would have... you would have taken a substantial step.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.460" offset="1309557">Now why would that not qualify under the words of the statute that referred to a potential risk?</text>
            <text syncTime="296.646" offset="1338292">Haven't you created the potential for the risk of harm that the statute is getting at when you take the substantial step?</text>

            <text syncTime="322.261" offset="1440796">If you started up the ladder and that's the way the attempted burglary conviction came down, it would be a lot closer call to say that would be a potential risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.132" offset="1480293">Whether it's a serious potential risk under Taylor, it is not as clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.173" offset="1520417">As I understand, you would... you have to analyze it on the basis of whether generically attempted burglary as a whole presents a serious enough risk; isn't that the way it has to be done?</text>

            <text syncTime="359.511" offset="1589799">No, but I thought your argument was that that analysis would not lead to the result unfavorable to your client because the nature of starting up the ladder did not create or could not reasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.065" offset="1660016">In other words, I thought you were saying... maybe I misunderstood your argument... that the reason the Taylor analysis favors you is that merely taking a substantial step... which is what the indictment would charge... could not be seen as creating the potential risk that the statute talks about.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.902" offset="1743399">Now if I'm not understanding your argument correctly, you know, straighten me out here.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.446" offset="1773492">That substantial step in even taking a step up the ladder, Mr. James would submit based on the language of the statute, would not qualify and would not create that serious potential risk of physical injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.715" offset="1890625">And it seems to me, if you're going to do it generically, you have to look over the whole scope of possible attempts and say does the whole scope of possible attempts bear, I would say, a similar risk of the use of physical force as do the specifically mentioned crimes of burglary, arson or extortion?</text>
            <text syncTime="461.470" offset="1997622">Indeed, I guess you have to use the least dangerous.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.308" offset="2060943">Now that "otherwise", that refers me back to the crimes already mentioned, and I would say that means that the unnamed crime has to have a similar risk, at least a risk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes mentioned, which I would take to be extortion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.543" offset="4981955">Moreover, when they dealt with whether they wanted to include attempted burglary, they were dealing with career offender, which has, although it increases the guideline range a person can be sentenced to, it certainly doesn't increase the statutory maximum in zero to 10 year offense to a 15 years to life offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.128" offset="5056248">So for those reasons, even if the sentencing commission feels that the career offender statute or guideline should include attempted burglary, that doesn't mean this Court should use that for the armed career criminal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.760" offset="7022850">And the case discusses a couple of cases from various Florida courts of appeals where the courts construed the concept of curtilage and held that in one case it was marijuana that was quite a distance away from the, from a dwelling house, in another case a whiskey still that was a distance about 50 yards away from the dwelling house, that those were too far out to be considered part of the curtilage, part of that area that immediately surrounds the dwelling that's associated with the intimate activities of the dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.202" offset="7148551">So Florida... and Florida... and I think the Court should take the Florida Supreme Court at its word when it said it's going to strictly construe that concept, and when it said it's not going to construe it to produce absurd, harsh or unreasonable results, keeping in mind how serious the offense of burglary is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.178" offset="7208424">So I think the... so the first step, I think, if you don't... if you don't believe that the way Florida defines burglary is generic in the way Congress had in mind, I don't think you could conclude that it presents a categorically different set of risks such that it would even fall outside the otherwise clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.553" offset="7369965">I think now carports are considered part of the dwelling itself, the structure itself but under... but if it... but under the Florida's concept of curtilage if the area was not enclosed, it was not enclosed by a fence or other structure it would not be considered part of the curtilage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.796" offset="7442899">And in fact, the State versus Hamilton case, it cited a case that cast a doubt on a prior case that had found a burglary that took place on a driveway, and noted that the court in that case hadn't determined whether the area, whether the driveway was enclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.573" offset="7498070">So it does... the statute does... the concept does require an enclosure and the area immediately surrounding the dwelling and I think it is very difficult to conclude that that, that defined in that way, in that limited way, that someone who's intending to get on to a residence into the area either in or right around the dwelling, that that person is not sort of categorically dangerous kind of person that Congress had in mind when it set out burglary as one of the paradigmatic offenses in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.523" offset="13589825">But on your argument, even though Florida is not a generic burglary State, an attempted burglary will always satisfy the "otherwise" prong; is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.487" offset="13773727">In fact, in footnote 9 of the reply brief we cited the Golden opinion from the Seventh Circuit and in that particular opinion the court found that serious potential risk for someone who failed to report to a jail because they speculate, you know, law enforcement might have to go and arrest them and there could be violence in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.152" offset="13856378">Well, that happens in all crimes, the potential for law enforcement to arrest somebody.</text>
