            <text syncTime="1120.936" offset="4634119">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.246" offset="4659406">An action to determine whether property taxes are owed is not a case in which rights of immovable property are an issue, and it's not transformed into such a case by attaching a lien, and recharacterizing the case as one to determine the validity of the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.163" offset="4715099">And I'd like to begin by picking up, Justice Ginsburg, on the question you just asked, because I think it's very important to emphasize that under Respondent's lien-based theory, that theory has the potential largely to eviscerate the other exceptions in the FSIA in the following sense: Respondent's theory doesn't turn in any way on the nature or source of the debt that's secured by the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.185" offset="4799109">So under Respondent's view, the fact that this case involves a debt that arises out of property taxes is largely beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.792" offset="4825544">The load bearing weight of that theory rests entirely on the supposed effects of the lien on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.664" offset="4849055">And so for example, you could have a case in which a commercial activity is brought into play, where the plaintiff sues a foreign sovereign for commercial activity that occurs--</text>

            <text syncTime="1194.610" offset="4928885">Let's suppose that there is an American who is very friendly to and sympathetic with the Indian government, and gives them real estate, not a commercial activity, he gives them real estate in which to house the employees in... in their mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.055" offset="5010596">However, he retains an interest in that real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.288" offset="5027523">He retains a lien on the real estate, to have money paid to him at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.128" offset="5050929">He is not willing to give the full amount of the property, but most of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.491" offset="6552343">But there are other instruments that result in a cloud on title but that wouldn't be considered rights in property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.521" offset="6576480">One example would be a contract, a purchase option contract to purchase property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.670" offset="6801133">And Respondent doesn't attempt to defend that position, but that's the predicate on which our Englewood brief rested.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.870" offset="6845855">Now, with respect to the question of whether a lien establishes rights in property, which is now the focus of Respondent's argument, I would point out that in other areas of the law the Court has looked to questions concerning whether there is a right to exclude others, whether there is a right to obtain income from the property, whether there is a right to assert possession of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.861" offset="6921819">That's, for example, the types of considerations this Court takes into account in the tax area in assessing whether a Federal tax lien can attach to a property by virtue of the fact that there is a right to property at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.873" offset="6973855">And we think the same sorts of consideration should inform the Court's assessment of the immovable property exception in this case.</text>
