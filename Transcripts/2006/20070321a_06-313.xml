            <text syncTime="7.823" offset="184071">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.760" offset="211866">While this Court has laid out a framework for reviewing prosecutors' closing arguments, the fairness standard established in Donnelly and Darden is by its nature a very general standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.253" offset="273828">Under this Court's interpretation of AEDPA, the State court should therefore be provided more leeway in reaching outcomes.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.342" offset="310191">Nevertheless, the Eighth Circuit afforded no deference to the Missouri Supreme Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.137" offset="333283">Instead, its improperly substituted its own evaluation for the comments, looking at each of them in isolation and without considering the totality of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.787" offset="383960">That decision was wrong not only because the court of appeals failed to properly afford deference to the State court, but because when viewed within the entire proceedings the prosecutor's closing arguments did not deprive the Respondent of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.469" offset="450625">Applying AEDPA correctly, the Missouri Supreme Court decision was well within reason given, one, the nonspecific standard of fundamental fairness and the fact that this Court has never applied that standard to a penalty phase closing argument; and, two, because, considering the record in the entire proceedings of this case, the Respondent was not deprived of fundamental fairness.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.438" offset="594507">And it's certainly is not our argument that it would not apply to the penalty phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.640" offset="615301">However, there simply may be other considerations, because the fundamental fairness standard essentially answers the question, did the jury base their verdict on the evidence or did they base it improperly on the prosecutor's comments.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.369" offset="810279">So even assuming that all of the statements were improper, those considerations when applied to this case show that the trial was not rendered unfair because of the prosecutor's argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.156" offset="13645387">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.233" offset="13649671">I would like to address two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.358" offset="13658240">First, it is not clearly established that deterrence arguments in closing arguments are improper, and for good reason, particularly because of the strength of this... the evidence in this case and the fact that the Respondent had killed a Federal witness execution-style.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.896" offset="13720411">To that extent, as I understand the Respondent's argument, the deterrence rises or falls on however the prosecutor has prefaced his deterrence argument, if he says certain words to mitigate the deterrence argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.516" offset="13778821">However, trials don't operate in terms of specific words that must be pre-spoken before an argument can be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.374" offset="13810272">Secondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's question previously, I would advise that prosecutors should not use some arguments, not necessarily the deterrence argument, but not that in every instance they must not use those arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.585" offset="13879131">This Court's supervisory role in those kinds of cases allows this Court to turn should's into must's for Federal prosecutors, but that is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.204" offset="13921554">Second... thirdly, the Viereck case is in a historical context which we don't have here, and the Missouri Supreme Court did consider the penalty phase arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.436" offset="13974530">At page 237 of the appendix the court specifically said:</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.791" offset="13991980">"We have reviewed the penalty phase arguments. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.697" offset="14003578">And then at page 235, the Missouri Supreme Court distinguishes Newlon and says that they do not rise to the level of the statements made in Newlon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.710" offset="14043598">So to that extent the Missouri State court was not an unreasonable application of this Court's precedents and deference should afforded to that State court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.765" offset="14087797">For that reason we would ask that this case be reversed.</text>
