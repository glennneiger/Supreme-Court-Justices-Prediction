            <text syncTime="15.041" offset="216510">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.790" offset="227586">Section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act provides that the Environmental Protection Agency shall approve an application by a State to administer its own NPDES program unless EPA finds that the state's program does not satisfy nine criteria that are addressed to whether the State has the legal authority under State law to carry forward with the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.405" offset="322044">There's no dispute in this case that Arizona's program satisfies those criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.494" offset="342315">The Ninth Circuit nonetheless set aside EPA's approval of Arizona's program.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.369" offset="361855">The Ninth Circuit held that EPA could not approve Arizona's application unless it first insured that there would be in place under Arizona's administration protections equivalent to those that would be applicable under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act when EPA itself issues permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.063" offset="444611">That holding is inconsistent not only with Section 402(b)'s mandatory directive, it's also inconsistent with Section 7 of the ESA itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.325" offset="481705">Do we take the case and... I'll ask the same question to your colleagues from the other side... on the assumption that if the nine... the factors in the statutes are met, that EPA has no discretion to withhold the transfer?</text>

            <text syncTime="96.583" offset="542727">That is our position, and that I think is clear from Section 402(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="103.346" offset="569790">It says that the administrator shall approve unless he finds that the state legal authority criteria are not satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.640" offset="598942">I should also point out that that's reinforced by 33 U.S.C. 1251(b), which expresses a strong preference for State protection of waters and in particular states that it's the policy of Congress that the states administer the NPDES program.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.835" offset="691729">Well, until 1993 when the vast majority... by the time... by that time the vast majority of transfers or approvals had already taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.879" offset="727883">There had never been consultation, at least that we're aware of under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.438" offset="750139">EPA did consult with the wildlife agencies on six programs but after the Fifth Circuit... from then until... until this one, but after the Fifth Circuit's decision in the American Forestry case, EPA never tried to impose any obligations on a State under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.162" offset="848986">What it did is, EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service worked out between themselves certain arrangements by which EPA would look at endangered species considerations, but it never conditioned the approval of a State program after the Louisiana program struck down in the American Forestry decision in 1998, on the states having in place certain protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.931" offset="956088">And in fact, I think EPA would not characterize what it did even in the Louisiana programs as the sort of condition that the Fifth Circuit understood.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.789" offset="999556">Because there's an allegation in one of the briefs that you changed your position in this Court, to change the position you took even in the lower courts at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.079" offset="1052741">Section 7 imposes an obligation on Federal agencies in their own actions not to jeopardize... or to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize a species.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.761" offset="1099448">Ancillary to that, there is an obligation on Federal agencies to consult with the fish and wildlife agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.164" offset="1125048">As to the consultation obligation, as I mentioned, EPA has engaged in consultation from 1993 until--</text>

            <text syncTime="284.868" offset="1295889">Isn't there a difference between denying the application because the Endangered Species Act hasn't been attended to adequately, and saying you meet the nine criteria, you're going to get your application.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.187" offset="1365166">But then, so it's not just automatic that the thing becomes the State's domain rather than the Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.387" offset="1397976">But isn't there something rather detailed called a memorandum of agreement that's worked out, and couldn't the Endangered Species Act concerns be accommodated that way instead of saying one statute is out the window, even though EPA in a number of states has made an accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.768" offset="1491494">Why couldn't the Endangered Species Act concerns be reflected in that memorandum of agreement?</text>

            <text syncTime="359.540" offset="1594521">They typically address such things as how the State agency will furnish EPA draft permits and that sort of thing, time limitations for EPA to look at, who to contact at the State agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.488" offset="1650319">It's essentially procedural in order to facilitate EPA's continuing oversight role.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.561" offset="1670590">It's not a vehicle for EPA to impose substantive obligations coming from other statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.909" offset="1751987">Now, if a State agency chooses to cooperate with Fish and Wildlife Service or NOAA in the Department of Commerce with respect to species under its jurisdiction, that is all fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.712" offset="1835266">I mean, you quite rightly emphasize the mandatory nature of the approval under the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.412" offset="1862015">But the Endangered Species Act mandate seems equally unconditional.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.935" offset="1936098">But more fundamentally in response to your question, Section 7 imposes obligations only on Federal agencies, not on State agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.703" offset="2075174">What I think they're arguing is that when, when, when the agency gives the approval, it should require that there be some kind of procedure in place on the part of the State so that when problems arise the States will probably respond to them with the same values in mind that the feds would.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.955" offset="2172245">And the question is why cannot the Endangered Species Act be enforced in that way, to require, in effect, an advanced mechanism before, in effect, the whole business is turned over to the States?</text>

            <text syncTime="663.219" offset="2809215">Isn't it likely that the States are going to respond or deal with the problem if they have an obligation in the memorandum of agreement right up front?</text>

            <text syncTime="676.012" offset="2860415">But let me, let me, let me explain what is in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.056" offset="2876611">EPA's regulations require that a State furnish its draft permits to the public, but also specifically to the Federal wildlife agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.566" offset="2918616">That gives Fish and Wildlife Service an opportunity to comment about endangered species concerns that may be raised by the draft permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.204" offset="2961143">The regulations also require the State agency to take into account the comments that are submitted by anyone, including the Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.404" offset="3001999">Those provisions built in allow the Federal agencies to bring their concerns to the State agency, and I think there is every reason to believe that the State agencies will--</text>
            <text syncTime="722.537" offset="3046511">--Is there an obligation on the part of the State agency to take reasonable action in response to them, or can the State agency simply sit there, listen with a tin ear and then do whatever it wants to?</text>

            <text syncTime="735.457" offset="3098234">Then what happens if the State agency does not respond to the concerns raised or does not remedy the concerns raised by Fish and Wildlife Service or NOAA, EPA is notified and EPA can then try to work it out with the State agency, or, failing that, EPA can object to the State permit if it does not satisfy the Clean Water Act standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.334" offset="3209724">And again with respect to water quality, those standards are set at a level that is necessary to protect endangered species.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.796" offset="4311569">And as I said, that's inconsistent not only with 402(b), but with Congress's federalism-sensitive judgment, to impose the sort of substantive and procedural administrative requirements in Section 7 of the ESA only on Federal agencies, not on State agencies.</text>

I think if in the end of the day you look at all of these opportunities to protect species and you say there's nothing we can do about it and the State refuses to cooperate, you have what's called jeopardy or destruction of critical habitat, and Congress said that the mechanism for working out the conflict with another law is the endangered species committee, which we have not talked about very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.150" offset="13508970">That was Congress's answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.729" offset="13515344">But what I was trying to suggest was, long before you get to that point and without imposing a single obligation on the State, simply using the authority under 402(d) of the Clean Water Act, which provides for this oversight opportunity, the service and the EPA can come to their own understanding as to how EPA will in fact carry out its post-transfer review of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.579" offset="13598727">And we think that is, that is an acceptable answer to the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3367.228" offset="13625267">Mr. Chief Justice:</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.839" offset="13631746">First, with respect, stepping back and looking at the legal theory, we think that this case is really on all fours with the Public Citizen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.240" offset="13661316">In fact, the court of appeals recognized that the operative regulation here, the definition of "indirect effect", meaning something caused by the agency, is just like the one in Public Citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.752" offset="13703426">In Public Citizen this Court held that where an agency has a mandatory duty and does not have the ability to control subsequent events, that the agency cannot be regarded as the legal cause of whatever effects happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.463" offset="13758178">That is exactly the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.573" offset="13766642">Section 402(b) mandates that EPA approve the State's application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.822" offset="13787644">EPA therefore, EPA's decision therefore is not the legal cause of any effects that might happen with respect to endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.288" offset="13821499">I should point out that in this Court's decision in Sweet Home this Court in footnotes 9 and 13 read the other principal provision of the ESA, the take provision, to incorporation a proximate cause limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.469" offset="13870296">We think it follows that the jeopardize prohibition in Section 7 also incorporates a proximate cause or here legal cause restriction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.072" offset="13912614">Mr. Kneedler, I hate to eat up any of your rebuttal time, but would you state briefly what... how you would treat these other matters that were resolved by the agency and that were not mandatory, its decision to transfer prior certificate authority to the States, for example, and the other instance raised by opposing counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.333" offset="13997669">What if I agree with you on whether you can deny the NPDES permit, but I'm concerned about these other actions by the agency that were discretionary?</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.467" offset="14046257">There has been no challenge to that, so I'm not in a position to give a definitive answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.389" offset="14065901">But I believe to the extent it would be discretionary that Section 7 may well kick in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.524" offset="14098501">There was no challenge to that aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.742" offset="14107383">This was a challenge to the transfer of authority, not ancillary matters addressed under the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.178" offset="14129117">Also, footnote 18 of the court of appeals opinion makes clear that Respondents did not challenge anything to do with funding, which is an entirely separate administrative determination that there's a regulatory set of criteria for how funding gets distributed, it is not dependent on whether the State has NPDES authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.168" offset="14205081">Section 106 of the Clean Water Act has a separate funding mechanism for Clean Water Act authority generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.259" offset="14229427">So funding is simply not, it's simply not in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.427" offset="14266103">Yes, and in fact this Court's decision in Hill can't be understood in any other day because the Court went out of its way to say that, while Congress committee reports indicated, for the appropriations bills, indicated an expectation that the dam would be built, the Court emphasized the fact that there was no mandate in the appropriations statute itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3562.663" offset="14407060">I've never heard of an agency that could just give out money to whoever they want, like you or me.</text>

            <text syncTime="3589.714" offset="14515207">There may be particular applications of the standard, but that did not deter this Court in Public Citizen, where the Court applied the same principle and said where the agency has a mandatory duty and no discretion it is not the legal cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.224" offset="14565257">That's the general principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.487" offset="14570273">If there are other cases where that general principle has to be applied, there will be time enough for that consideration to arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.344" offset="14601724">Another important aspect of Hill is this Court quoted Representative Dingell, the sponsor of it, saying that agencies are to take actions within their power, which suggest that... and we think it's clear through the history, as we recite in our brief at pages 27 and 28, from the text of the Act and from the evolution of Section 7, it was always understood to apply to situations where the agencies had the existing authority to take action, not to require them to countermand statutory directives the way the Department of Transportation could not countermand statutory directives in Public Citizen.</text>
