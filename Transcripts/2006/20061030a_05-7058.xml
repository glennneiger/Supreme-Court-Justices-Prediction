            <text syncTime="9.950" offset="194593">In these three cases, each of the three petitioners filed administrative grievances with the Michigan Department of Corrections.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.822" offset="218103">The Michigan Department of Corrections conducted investigations and issued final decisions on the merits of petitioner's grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.288" offset="239942">Nevertheless, a year and a half later, each of the petitioner's complaints was thrown out of federal court without leave to amend because petitioners failed to satisfy on of the Sixth Circuit's judge-made corollaries to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.284" offset="291978">None of those three corollaries find any meaningful support in the Federal Rules of Procedure, in fact they contradict the federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.641" offset="317369">Nor do they find any support in administrative law or habeas law, the two areas of law to which this Court looks for guidance in interpreting administrative litigation and format.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.497" offset="352791">Finally, the overwhelming majority of the circuits that have considered these questions have rejected them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.088" offset="375151">I'd like to begin with the heightened pleading rule that the Sixth District applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.884" offset="390407">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a plaintiff to simply provide a short claim statement of the basis on which his or her claim will lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.847" offset="430218">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do enumerate certain kinds of allegations that a plaintiff must plead with specificity, those are enumerated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(c), but exhaustion is not one of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.277" offset="519974">And the district court said, the only way I can figure out the good 20 percent from the 80 percent that are going to ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a more definite, an order for a more definite statement, because I'll do it sua sponte under 12(e), I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.937" offset="786632">--Well, what sets the Sixth Circuit's rule apart from I think the hypothetical you propose, and also from this Court's habeas jurisprudence is that in both of those scenarios the plaintiff, the prisoner, is given a chance to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.495" offset="844833">In the Sixth Circuit, if they don't they don't satisfy the heightened pleading rule at the minute that they file their initial complaint, they are out.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.490" offset="872836">There is no leave to amend, and that's what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.551" offset="885062">In Petitioner Jones' case, he filed the complaint and he actually did allege that he exhausted his administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.018" offset="910871">He said: I exhausted my administrative remedies, I filed my step one grievance on this date, I received a denial on that date, and he went down the list through all three steps.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.671" offset="945561">The briefs point out that a number of district courts have form complaints that are often used in these cases and that these forms call on the prisoner-plaintiff to address the issue of exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.213" offset="995716">Now, do you think there's something wrong with those forms, and if a prisoner fills out the form and reveals in filling it out that a claim was not exhausted, is it improper for the district court at the screening stage to dismiss the case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jean-Claude Andre</label>
            <text syncTime="282.652" offset="1285467">We would certainly concede that if it is clear on the face of the complaint that a prisoner has not exhausted his or her administrative remedies then that claim can be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.102" offset="1323292">I guess the way it would operate... and I haven't seen a case like this... but it would be where a prisoner says, I didn't exhaust my administrative remedies and I have no excuse for failing to do so, but please, district court, please take mercy on me.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.238" offset="1367805">And in that situation the district court could say, there's absolutely no way you can possibly prevail on the merits, so your claim--</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="310.906" offset="1398420">Probably the reason they do this is that there are lots and lots of claims by prisoners in Federal courts that are hard to decipher.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.434" offset="1428618">They don't know what it's about.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.043" offset="1434991">They don't want to put the defendant to the burden of coming in in every single complaint when it's quite a good probability it's about nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.868" offset="1470309">That's the kind of reasoning that would lead to a rule like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.287" offset="1487968">So... and then you have the statute and the statute says indeed there's a special power here to dismiss if it's frivolous or it doesn't state a claim or malicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.424" offset="1528510">So why isn't this just an exercise of the Sixth Circuit's or a court's ordinary subsidiary rulemaking powers?</text>

            <text syncTime="359.887" offset="1594338">And as this Court this repeatedly said, including as recently as last term in Hill v. McDonough, the Court will not impose a heightened pleading requirement absent an amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.688" offset="1693604">I mean, by definition an affirmative defense gets raised by the defendant and so on, so if we amended the Federal Rules in practical terms it would be like adding an element to the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.946" offset="1770613">But Rule 8 and the normal rules weren't addressed to the unusual situation under the PLRA where the district court has an affirmative obligation screen on its own before the defendant even gets involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.692" offset="1817633">So if in fact, just to follow on Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, 80 percent of the cases have this exhaustion problem, why isn't this a reasonable means of facilitating the screening obligation?</text>

            <text syncTime="429.390" offset="1872386">It may be a reasonable means, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's permissible, because Congress had exhaustion in mind when it enacted the PLRA and noticeably absent from all the PLRA screening provisions is the term "exhaustion".</text>

            <text syncTime="441.072" offset="1919093">Well, but you just told me earlier that if it was a case in which exhaustion is required and not done that would be a frivolous claim, and the statute does refer to frivolous claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.460" offset="1952634">So the district court or the Sixth Circuit has just said, we know that in a large number of cases they are going to be frivolous because they have ignored the exhaustion requirement, and we just want to try to find out which those cases are to fulfill the screening obligation, which takes this out of the normal Rule 8 type of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.513" offset="2028911">I think it goes back still to the fact that there's not a clear Congressional expression to take these cases out of the Federal Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.543" offset="2060990">In Califano v. Yamasaki we believe is instructive on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.400" offset="2076454">In in that case the Secretary of the Department of Health Education and Welfare had argued that Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, which used the term 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.925" offset="2138521">This Court said: No, we cannot read the word "individual" as such a clear expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.672" offset="2165480">It may have been Congress's policy to have individual claims be addressed one by one, but you have to find that clear expression in the statute and that clear expression is not here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.370" offset="13432301">Justice Ginsburg, you asked earlier about who is better equipped to plead and show exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.226" offset="13471694">It's certainly our position that the Michigan Department of Corrections or prison grievance administrators are absolutely better equipped to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3337.285" offset="13503981">The prisoner is the one who presumably knows best whether or not he filed a grievance or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.125" offset="13547344">The prisoner may not know precise dates on which he or she did so or have copies of the grievances anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.747" offset="13565839">This really kind of brings the heightened pleading rule, not just whether it's just affirmative defense or a general pleading rule, to the fore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.010" offset="13590916">Prisoners are prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.151" offset="13595409">They get moved around, they get put in administrative segregation; they are subject to repeat searches; they have great difficulty in maintaining possession of their belongings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.226" offset="13627697">On the other hand the Michigan Department of Corrections keeps copies of all the grievances, denials and appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.724" offset="13649744">This seems to me to be a stretch to say that the prison, which has how many prisoners under their jurisdiction, is in a better position to know in individual cases, an individual prisoner, what this prisoner did or didn't do with respect to the grievance process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.562" offset="13701049">Surely the prisoner is in the best position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.952" offset="13710662">He knows what he did or at least what he is going to allege.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.560" offset="13721111">He may be able to aver generally but with specificity there are many cases in which he won't be able to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.277" offset="13739919">But the Michigan Department of Corrections' policy directive makes clear that it has to maintain these records for future FOIA requests, and in many institutions it has to track them in a computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.118" offset="13775341">And as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, in the Jones case, they were quite able to bring forward the proof of exhaustion that would satisfy, that would have satisfied the court that Jones had exhausted his administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.160" offset="13819436">Jones gets, just got thrown out of court, essentially, in a game of "gotcha", because he hadn't attached his complaint in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.204" offset="13843677">I think most importantly, from a judicial efficiency standpoint, making exhaustion an affirmative defense makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.421" offset="13868546">That means that the lawyers in the state attorney's general, in the state, in the office of the state's attorneys general, are going to be able to put forward the best arguments as to why a claim is or is not exhausted.</text>
