            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1603, Jeffrey A. Beard v. George E. Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.256" offset="33019">Mr. Eisenberg.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_eisenberg" startTime="75.380" stopTime="230.014">
            <label>Mr. Ronald Eisenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="75.380" offset="301453">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="77.731" offset="310857">At his trial in 1983, George Banks' team of three defense lawyers presented 23 mitigation witnesses, including three forensic psychiatrists, his mother, brother, and co-workers, a priest, and two nuns.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.786" offset="359131">The trial court instructed the jury that it must consider any mitigating evidence unless it was unanimous in rejecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.861" offset="387344">Now Banks claims that Mills v. Maryland, a ruling of this Court made after the completion of his direct appeal, entitles him to re-open his death sentence for the killing of 13 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.824" offset="431229">In fact, Mills creates a new distinct rule regulating the manner of conducting a death penalty hearing that is not applicable retroactively and that in any case was reasonably applied by the State courts attempting to interpret it.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.139" offset="492460">The primary issue in this case, though, is whether the Mills rule which prohibits unanimity requirements at the mitigation stage was merely a minor application of existing law dictated by prior precedent or whether it's instead Teague-barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.969" offset="547840">Mills does cite Lockett v. Ohio for the general proposition that it's beyond dispute that the sentencer, quote/unquote, may not be precluded from considering mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.388" offset="589531">But before Mills, the sentencer, quote/unquote, always referred to the judge or the jury, never to individual jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.264" offset="617012">That was a leap made for the first time in Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.153" offset="628611">That was new.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.146" offset="632581">Even with a unanimity charge, although there wasn't one in this case, as we'll address, a jury still considered the evidence in the manner that juries historically have considered evidence, that is collaboratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.950" offset="679706">Until Mills, the Constitution had never been read to forbid unanimity as to verdicts, whether general verdicts or special verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.843" offset="707291">And even since Mills, as this Court recently said in Jones v. United States, we have long been of the view that the very object of the jury system is to secure unanimity by a comparison of views and by arguments among the jurors themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.582" offset="766328">So the question of jury unanimity, we believe, remained open not only after Lockett but even within the understanding of members of this Court at the time of Mills and thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.272" offset="809064">In fact, in McKoy v. North Carolina, decided 2 years after Mills, four Justices of the Court rejected Lockett as supporting, let alone compelling, a rule against jury unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.533" offset="858070">Now, whether the dissenters in McKoy can be said to be right or wrong about the meaning of Mills is irrelevant in this Teague context.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.872" offset="891402">The question is that they believed that Mills, not to mention Lockett, did not resolve the unanimity question presented here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="230.014" stopTime="239.097">
            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="230.014" offset="920033">Mr. Eisenberg, tell... tell us exactly what you mean by jury unanimity because, you know, most States require jury unanimity in the... in the final verdict.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_eisenberg" startTime="239.097" stopTime="307.994">
            <label>Mr. Ronald Eisenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="239.097" offset="956291">Excuse me, Your Honor, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.212" offset="960784">I mean only at the stage of finding whether particular mitigating circumstances are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.958" offset="979801">That is the... the jury unanimity question that was decided in the Mills and McKoy cases, as I've said, subject to dispute, strong dispute, among the Court that continued even after Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.012" offset="1027971">Because this is a Teague case, the question, as I've said, is not whether Mills was right or McKoy was right or which side can be better defended now, but whether State court judges reasonably could have known what the outcome would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.645" offset="1078544">And since even within the Court there was such continuing controversy on the matter, it cannot be said that State judges reasonably could have known, and therefore the case is Teague-barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.099" offset="1116369">But that uncertainty continued even beyond McKoy because in the next similar case before the Court, Walton v. Arizona, the issue was presented on essentially the same basis as the Mills case had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.588" offset="1174256">The single hold-out juror scenario, that a single juror because of a unanimity requirement in Mills or because, in Walton, a preponderance of the evidence standard, could block consideration of mitigating evidence and thereby mandate a death penalty case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="307.994" stopTime="341.802">
            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="307.994" offset="1231935">On... on the instructions in the red brief at page 8 and then at page 9, there are two different instructions set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.571" offset="1270282">This is in the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.428" offset="1277701">And then the jury form which has to be checked is set out on pages 9 and 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.935" offset="1311660">In your view is that all we should consider when we interpret these instructions, or do you have some additional instructions that you wish us to refer to?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_eisenberg" startTime="341.802" stopTime="441.620">
            <label>Mr. Ronald Eisenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="341.802" offset="1367144">Your Honor, I think that the instruction here was basically the same throughout, that the message as to unanimity regarding mitigation or not was basically the same throughout the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.819" offset="1403193">It's in the joint appendix at page 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.517" offset="1418031">It's repeated at page 26, and we think embodied in the jury form... I'm sorry... also at pages 66 and 67.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.236" offset="1448856">And in each of those cases, the jury was instructed first that it must be unanimous to find aggravation or no mitigation and then that it must unanimously find whether any... find aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.211" offset="1512803">But, of course, the threshold question is whether the State courts could even have known that there was such a thing as a rule against unanimity, whether or not unanimity was actually required on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.985" offset="1555853">And the Walton case, as I've mentioned, is relevant to that question because in Walton the same argument was at issue, and the argument was that because of the preponderance of the evidence standard, a hold-out juror or even really 12 hold-out jurors, so to speak, could be somewhat persuaded by mitigating evidence, could think it significant, but not quite past the tipping point required by the preponderance standard and yet be precluded from considering that evidence at all in the weighing stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.957" offset="1675807">And yet, the defendant lost that argument in Walton.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.454" offset="1693780">And again, the relevance for Teague purposes is to leave the State courts in the position of trying to determine before Walton, before McKoy, before Mills, in this case in 1983 that the Eighth Amendment through the Lockett case somehow precluded the establishment of unanimity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="441.620" stopTime="511.549">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="441.620" offset="1766400">Well, with Lockett... with Lockett they... what Lockett says is that the sentencer cannot be precluded from considering as a mitigating factor any aspect of the defendant's character or record or any circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.564" offset="1826168">Now, one thing that could have meant... one thing... is that you cannot execute a person unless 12 people think that not only that crime is unusually terrible... that's aggravating... but also that it outweighs in this person's life any good things he wants to bring in.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.366" offset="1929404">That's his character.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.852" offset="1935360">And 12 people have to come to that ultimate judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.938" offset="1951660">Now, if that's so, 12 people have to come to that ultimate judgment, 12 people have not come to that ultimate judgment when in fact 11 would let him off, but one blocks it by saying I don't agree that this is the mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.233" offset="2020833">So if that's what Lockett means, it would be obvious that that wouldn't satisfy it.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.342" offset="2153326">So, of course, it could have meant that.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.745" offset="2158968">But the fact that it could have meant that and was eventually held to mean that over continuing dissent by the Court is not... does not resolve the Teague question.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.716" offset="2350811">Penry did not involve this question of unanimity, and the reason I believe that the opinion was taken that it was obviously an application of Lockett is because it involved very much the same kind of categorical question that was presented in Lockett.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.091" offset="2404310">In the Penry case, there were three questions before the jury, three mitigating categories given to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.323" offset="2429283">The defendant said, I have some evidence that doesn't strictly fall within one of those three categories.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.234" offset="3640842">First of all, the reason that there are checks there is that the jury, under the Pennsylvania structure, is essentially required to give a second look at mitigation in the weighing charge, even if some of those jurors may have... even if the jurors may have been in dispute about the existence of those mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.348" offset="3717329">So in order to apply the first phase of the instructions, they have to decide whether all of them find no mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.376" offset="3741466">If all of them don't find the absence of mitigation, then they go to the second stage, and at that point, they are all required to look at mitigation, even if they might have voted against it the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.893" offset="3787546">So the statute appropriately tracks the kind of mitigation that all of them are required to consider in the weighing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.331" offset="3813251">The second point I want to make, however, Your Honor, is that, of course, this is not the first time that a verdict form like this and an instruction like this have been looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.761" offset="3843030">And I must emphasize this is a deference case under section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.476" offset="3857868">As I explained, the Third Circuit in 1991 looked at a verdict form like this and said, no, this is not a violation of Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.528" offset="3890051">Other circuits around the United States have consistently held that this kind of instruction and verdict form are not a violation of Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.535" offset="3922129">Where the... where the instruction and verdict form explicitly require unanimity as to aggravation but don't explicitly require unanimity as to mitigation, then there's no violation of Mills.</text>

            <text syncTime="1267.337" offset="5069322">And whether or not plausible means reasonable, it surely does not mean unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.644" offset="5090534">And yet, in the first post-AEDPA case involving Mills that came along in the Third Circuit, this one, the Third Circuit held without discussion of either its original 1991 ruling that had upheld this charge or any discussion of its 1997 ruling that had noted that the contrary construction was not unreasonable, the Third Circuit held in this case that no court could reasonably have applied Mills in the way that the State court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.473" offset="5217802">And the... the reason that all the other circuits have disagreed with the Third Circuit on that and that the Third Circuit itself has come to a different position on that gets back to Mills itself because Mills was not the kind of charge that was involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.417" offset="5277571">In Mills, the charge explicitly required the jury to be unanimous in order to find the presence of mitigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.314" offset="5661153">The two stages of the process that are laid out in the instruction in question are not parallel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.692" offset="5694694">So the first stage says, you must be unanimous in finding aggravating circumstances or no mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.289" offset="5725100">And there's no question, as a matter of grammar, that there's only one verb in that sentence with two objects, aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1480.989" offset="5923944">That's why we have changed our verdict form, not because Pennsylvania has changed its understanding of what has always been the structure of its sentencing process, but because once Mills was decided, once the matter was constitutionalized, it became certainly wise for the court to attempt to avoid further litigation on the question by making it explicit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.338" offset="6077336">In fact, the State supreme court has always said that it has always read the statute to require unanimity only as to the absence, to the rejection of mitigation and not to the finding of any particular mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.393" offset="6125505">But in reference to your question concerning arguments of counsel, in fact, there was no argument of counsel from either side here that the jury had to be unanimous about mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.886" offset="6163540">In the same manner that Your Honor has suggested, presumably the prosecutor, had he believed that the jury had to be unanimous about mitigation, it would have been to his advantage to say so and to argue to the jury, all 12 of you have to find these before you can consider them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.851" offset="6215367">He didn't say anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.375" offset="6221427">And in fact, here's what the defense lawyer said in volume 6 of the trial transcript at pages 2300 and 2301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.313" offset="6249221">He wasn't, I believe, specifically referring to mitigation, but he said, quote, think individually, decide this individually.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.799" offset="6291122">Now, in light of the manner in which the case was argued to the jury and in light of the manner in which the judge presented the charge and laid out the verdict form, we believe that the jury would not have... cannot be assumed to have come to the wrong conclusion here, and surely that the State court and, as I've mentioned, every Federal circuit court looking at similar instructions and verdict forms, could not be said to have acted unreasonably in finding the absence of a Mills violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.835" offset="6435318">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.779" offset="6459037">Lockett and Eddings established a fundamental principle which basically provides that a State which creates any barrier which precludes a sentencer from giving full consideration and full effect to mitigating evidence relating to a person's character, background, and circumstances of the offense is constitutionally impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.275" offset="6585051">When we look at Mills and take into account the decision in McKoy, the unanimity instruction in Mills, in a weighing State such as Pennsylvania, essentially was a different type of barrier which precluded jurors to give effect to mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.657" offset="6706573">In a non-weighing State, the unanimity requirement would probably be appropriate, but in a weighing State, what happens is a single juror can say to other 11 jurors, I don't believe that this particular piece of evidence satisfies a mitigating circumstance, and that single juror can preclude those other 11 jurors from giving effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.880" offset="6939481">Justice Ginsburg, I think when you look back at the legal landscape over a period of time, going back from Hitchcock, to Skipper, to Eddings, in all of those cases, the Court dealt with different types of barriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.442" offset="7029760">The Court dealt with different pieces of factual evidence relating to character and background and circumstances of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.216" offset="7072810">When the Lockett rule was initially announced by a plurality of the Court, the Court could not perceive in the future every different type of barrier that may come about, and so what happened over a period of time, when you took the Lockett rule, you were essentially applying it to a variety of factual different situations, and each time the Court would look at a particular barrier, which it had not perceived in the past, and if it precluded a juror or a jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence, it struck down that barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.313" offset="7245218">And that's where we're coming from here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.542" offset="7254100">So when we say that it is a stretch of Lockett, I don't believe so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.049" offset="7508114">I did not glean from the dissent that they thought a unanimity requirement would not constitute a barrier to a jury or jurors giving effect to mitigating evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.322" offset="12273267">Jury instructions in capital cases to begin with are very difficult to get across to jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.511" offset="12305972">Just traditionally we've had a tough time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.603" offset="12314331">When you look at a case like this and you have the jury going through the guilt phase of the case, that jury is already conditioned to a unanimity requirement in finding guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.511" offset="12377966">When you then carry them over to a penalty phase and you take the instruction that we have here and you give that instruction to them, given the fact it's the way they've already been conditioned and listening to that instruction and hearing the word unanimously repeated and repeated, there is a substantial likelihood that the jury would interpret that instruction as requiring unanimity both as to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.852" offset="12527386">And that's the problem with the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.733" offset="12542851">And then when you take the verdict slip and put that on top of it, I think that compounds everything under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.576" offset="12582243">And that's the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.653" offset="12594573">When we... staying with this, when the State supreme court looked at the Mills issue... and they decided Mills on the merits in 1995.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.000" offset="12659984">It was not decided during the direct review process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.337" offset="12677329">Pennsylvania has a very unique procedure dealing with finality in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.910" offset="12699585">In 1995 when the State supreme court applied Mills on the merits, what they simply did was they said, we interpret our statute as not requiring unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.545" offset="12766145">They looked at only a portion of the instruction, I believe approximately three sentences, and they say, the instruction tracks the language of our statute and therefore there is no violation of Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.357" offset="12845349">I suggest that's an unreasonable application because what they didn't do is apply the correct standard in--</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.189" offset="12988709">Pennsylvania has a very different and unique procedure which essentially leaves open the direct review process because in capital proceedings in Pennsylvania prior to 1996, the State court on collateral review would apply any existing constitutional precedents to a claim, even though it was not considered first on direct review and even though the decision came up or was decided by this Court after the direct review process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.542" offset="13158087">It's a very different concept there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.092" offset="13172297">So there's a question here as to when finality I think occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.353" offset="13345332">In looking at Teague, one of the very first things you have to do is determine when the judgment is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.867" offset="13411370">Teague itself speaks in terms of conventional notions of finality, but that doesn't mean a State can't develop its own concept of finality to which the Federal courts should give respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.503" offset="13477930">After all, States have the primary responsibility for establishing rules of criminal procedure and protecting the rights of an accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.707" offset="13514815">With that in mind, concepts of federalism and comity which underline the basic precepts of Teague are not offended if a State court decides to keep open its direct review process and on collateral review say, look, here's a decision that came down from the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.255" offset="13601019">We are going to apply it to the facts of this case because we want to be absolutely certain that execution of an individual is beyond constitutional reproach.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald Eisenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3438.483" offset="13753887">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.795" offset="13763082">As to the last point concerning finality, Your Honor, and the argument that the... Pennsylvania has created a unique form of collateral review, which is really just direct review, that would be news to the State supreme court which declared this very case to have become final at the conclusion of direct appeal in 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.308" offset="13829224">Moreover, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has on numerous occasions applied the Teague rule in cases arising on collateral review to hold that the claim at issue was a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.485" offset="13877917">Obviously they couldn't have done that if they didn't think that their own collateral review occurred after the point of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.172" offset="13904666">And... and furthermore, in... in response to the argument that this Court may not have been fully aware of the supposedly unique nature of Pennsylvania's procedure, Mr. Flora made exactly that argument in the brief in opposition to certiorari that preceded this Court's previous summary disposition in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.852" offset="13971331">Concerning the general argument that Lockett is not a new rule because it forbids any barrier to the consideration of mitigation, of course the whole question of what's a barrier that qualifies for Lockett protection or not... and that question has by no means been clear, as I mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.178" offset="14044682">That was the exact argument that was at issue in Walton, and the majority of the Court held that to the extent the preponderance standard is a barrier, it's an acceptable barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.177" offset="14080627">But, of course, even in those cases where the Court has held that Lockett applies, to create a rule against a barrier to consideration such as Simmons and such as Caldwell, the Court has, nonetheless, held that that rule is new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.892" offset="14131513">Saffle is certainly additional support for that proposition, although in Saffle the Court declined to create a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.176" offset="14152620">In Simmons and Caldwell, the Court did find that the rule was required by Lockett, and yet in later cases found that the rule was new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.349" offset="14185326">Now, one of the reasons I think that the alternative view or the... the failure to see Lockett immediately as a case that precluded unanimity is because we must consider what the nature of consideration of mitigating circumstances is, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.214" offset="14260767">It's not merely a fact finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.610" offset="14270380">It is really a mixed question of law, in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.922" offset="14279680">The jury is not required to find fact A, fact B, or fact C. It is required to find a mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.033" offset="14304131">And given that that is the nature of mitigating circumstances, it was all the more reasonable for the States not to understand Lockett as precluding unanimity for the purposes of making that mixed fact... mixed fact and law determination at the mitigating stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.810" offset="14363167">But in any case, as I've said, given the dispute even on this Court, it was certainly reasonable for the... for the State courts not to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.901" offset="14395559">And given the dispute among the other courts about the... the nature of the application of the Mills rule to verdict forms and instructions like this one, it was certainly reasonable for the State courts to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3612.814" offset="14451252">See, this mixed question of fact of law that I think makes it more difficult for you in the sense that if it's a mixed question, it's really asking the jurors to decide should this person die, does he deserve to die.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.848" offset="14507363">And then the pre-Mills statute in the State becomes a situation where he will die even though 11 jurors think he shouldn't.</text>
