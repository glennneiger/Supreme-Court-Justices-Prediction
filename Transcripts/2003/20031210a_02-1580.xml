            <text syncTime="69.103" offset="276376">This Court held 17 years ago in Davis v. Bandemer that a claim of partisan gerrymandering is actionable under the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.442" offset="309708">But the lower courts have since effectively overruled Bandemer by requiring factual showings of plaintiffs in these cases that are both impossible and, I submit, irrational.</text>

            <text syncTime="96.474" offset="385881">--Well, the standard that I think was... the proper reading of Bandemer does not require that you show that your members of your party have been completely disenfranchised, to the extent that African-Americans once were in the South, or that... that your party has effectively been banned.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.129" offset="444500">The standard that was applied here required that you show that you're being prevented from registering to vote, from raising money, from campaigning, from showing up at the polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.334" offset="481280">Those kinds of constitutional violations don't make sense as an element of a partisan gerrymandering claim, because they're not about gerrymandering, and of course, they never occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.532" offset="522031">So if you're going to say the claim is justiciable, it doesn't make sense simultaneously to require people to establish those kinds of independent violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2133.087" offset="8532323">The aftermath of... of the Bandemer case in Indiana is instructive, because two years after this Court handed down its decision in Bandemer, the Democrats, who would have had the Court believe that they were consigned to an eternity of Republican tyranny, actually won 50 percent of the state House seats in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.013" offset="8616020">And only two years after that, in 1990, they won control, and control has flipped back and forth ever since in Indiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.154" offset="8680594">Now, the appellants test in using 10 years, instead of a base race as their own academic source recommends, actually gives a lot of weight to the past preferences of voters, dead voters, voters who have moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.533" offset="8750080">Naturally, this is a political choice, because any party that perceives this influence as waning over time will ask you to adopt a test that gives weight to past choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.081" offset="8800235">They also use high profile offices in choosing their races instead of low-profile statewide races, non-charismatic races as their... as their academic source recommends.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.832" offset="9175249">It's... it's the Al Gore race for President.</text>

            <text syncTime="3455.510" offset="13822015">Let me start off by saying I do think that our complaint satisfies the standards of the Powell opinion in... in Bandemer that it alleges that partisan maximization was the sole driving force behind this map.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.110" offset="13868408">And indeed, we had the opportunity in the district court, because of the one person, one vote problem, for the state to come in and try to come up with some justification for their line-drawing other than partisan maximization, and the district court found as a fact in that trial that the map jettisoned every criterion that this Court ever identified in Karcher, other than partisan maximization.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.364" offset="14013440">And let me just address the... the question of whether it makes sense to wait and see how the elections come out and see whether there is, in fact, this anti-majoritarian effect from the line-drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.106" offset="14052415">One of the real practical problems with that is that the lines themselves in a... in an extreme gerrymander like this, can... can effect the statewide aggregate vote totals themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.683" offset="14090658">You saw that right here where, in... with the history of votes very evenly divided in a... in a balanced map through the '90s, a court-drawn map.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.765" offset="14127020">Suddenly with this gerrymander you had five Republicans running unopposed, you had a number of the Democratic incumbents defeated in the primaries because they squared off--</text>

            <text syncTime="3539.195" offset="14156696">I guess if it were the constitutional rule, the party could adjust and try to run strong candidates, even in overwhelmingly Republican districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.654" offset="14186580">--Well, I suppose that that is in fact the case, but you can't assume that the... the vote totals under a gerrymander are independent of the effects of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.479" offset="14213851">First of all, if they pair the incumbents, they're just not there to run anymore, and there's a substantial distortion caused by the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.152" offset="14236526">There was some discussion by Mr. Krill of judicial races as the... the test of... of partisan balance in the map because the... the supposition was that judges, when they run, don't have any great personal magnetism, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.222" offset="14288875">But he didn't mention the... the race that was cited in our reply brief, which... this was 2003... where Mr. Bayer ran as a Democrat, got 52 percent of the votes statewide, and carried six out of the 19 districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.225" offset="14340807">That is an indication of the basic fundamental packing and cracking that's in the map, and is in fact a form of severe discrimination, making some voters' votes count much more forcefully than others.</text>
