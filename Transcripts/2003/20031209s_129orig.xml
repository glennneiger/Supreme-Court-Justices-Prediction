            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinion of the Court to announce No. 129 Original, the Commonwealth of Virginia versus the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.286" offset="33123">This control of the Potomac River has been disputed for nearly 400 years and in this case, we consider one aspect of this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.772" offset="67082">The Fairfax County Water Authority, a political subdivision of Virginia, sought a permit from Maryland to build a water intake structure extending 725 feet into the river from the Virginia shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.172" offset="124656">Maryland refused to issue the permit for four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.483" offset="137927">When it finally did, it plays restrictions on the amount of water that the authority could withdraw from the River.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.992" offset="163944">Virginia brought this action under our original jurisdiction seeking a declaration that it has the right to withdraw water and build improvements from each shore free from regulation by Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.318" offset="213264">We referred the action to a Special Master who recommended that we grant the relief sought by Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.035" offset="236042">Maryland filed exceptions to the report of the Master and we now overrule those exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.319" offset="261224">In the 17th century, Maryland and Virginia each claim sovereignty over the River under conflicting royal charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.458" offset="289750">This dispute is governed by two interstate compacts designed to settle ownership and regulation of the River.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.485" offset="317858">The compact of 1785 and the Black-Jenkins Award of 1877.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.173" offset="344607">The 1785 compact did not address sovereignty over the River.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.992" offset="363938">Among other things, however, it granted the citizens of each State full property rights in the land adjoining the River, with all the emoluments and advantages thereunto belonging as they put it and the privilege of building improvements from the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.602" offset="430393">We hold that this compact preserved the riparian rights of citizens of both States, subject to whatever later resolution of sovereignty would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.849" offset="467383">And that occurred in the Black-Jenkins Award of 1877.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.321" offset="485251">That Award recognized Maryland as the owner of the riverbed up to the low watermark on the Virginia shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.326" offset="517224">At the same time, however, the Award stated that Virginia has a right to such use of the River beyond the line of low watermark is maybe necessary to the full enjoyment of her riparian ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.385" offset="573440">We hold that the plain language of the Award grants Virginia's sovereign riparian rights and the River is subject only to federal common law and the limitations contained in the Award itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.388" offset="617535">Those were that Virginia neither impede navigation or interfere with the proper use of the Maryland River by Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.728" offset="650867">The Award does not allow Maryland to regulate Virginia's riparian use of the River.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.567" offset="670198">If it had, the stated limitations would have been entirely unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.708" offset="690782">Finally, we reject Maryland's claim that Virginia lost her rights under the Award by acquiescing in Maryland's regulation of her waterway activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.289" offset="729130">To the contrary, Virginia vigorously asserted her riparian rights into negotiations that led to the passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.294" offset="773120">So Maryland's exceptions are overruled, the relief sought by Virginia is granted, and the Special Master's proposed decree is entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.598" offset="802377">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Kennedy has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.147" offset="820558">Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
