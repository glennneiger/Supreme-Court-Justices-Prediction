            <text syncTime="69.557" offset="278152">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.529" offset="290064">Petitioners believe that a sole owner may be a participant in an employee benefit plan if another common law employee participates in such plan, regardless of whether that corporation or entity transacts business as a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.813" offset="347220">This belief is based on a plain reading of ERISA, the plan language in question here, the statutory scheme of ERISA, the DOL regulations and the policy considerations beside... excuse me... behind such regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.764" offset="403017">When ERISA was passed, it incorporated the term employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.441" offset="417750">This Court dealt with that term in Nationwide v. Darden and held that the term employee includes a common law employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.281" offset="449097">And... and the term participant in a plan says if you're an employee with a right to a benefit, then you've met the definition of participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.249" offset="480967">In just looking at these two terms alone, Yates was a participant in this plan and it's the petitioners' position as such he had the rights to enforce the rights of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.426" offset="529659">If you further read, the terms of the plan in and of itself support this.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.052" offset="548153">This was an IRS prototype plan and the plan allowed for sole owners, sole proprietors, partnerships, or even incorporated entities to participate as sole owners in the plan if they covered other common law employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.488" offset="609907">On top of this, if you look at the ERISA statutory schemes, when ERISA was passed, title I addressed many different concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.116" offset="644389">As I've already explained the definition of employee and participant specifically include the person such as Yates as allowing him to participate because he is an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.468" offset="689842">Furthermore, if you look at, for instance, ERISA section 1103(b), that provision excludes as an exclusion for certain aspects to the trust requirements of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.099" offset="740310">One of those specific exclusions if... is that some or all employees are employees as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, and a specific reference is made to 26 U.S.C. 401(c)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="197.609" offset="790361">And so you... you see a pattern here that the IRS Code and the ERISA law being congruent in its administration of plans and a specific reference to a definition of working employers that includes self-employed individuals, partnerships, and... and people such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.632" offset="858488">When ERISA was passed, title II of ERISA specifically dealt with changes to the tax code.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.137" offset="884506">It dealt with specifically amendments to code section 401.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.369" offset="1793463">In the terms of... I think the record is critical on this that he's a common law employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.265" offset="1813002">The retirement plan in and of itself defined compensation as W-2 compensation, which means FICA and FUTA, as you're inquiring, was withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.810" offset="1847171">And so as a W-2 employee, the monies that were contributed to this plan were based on a percentage of his W-2 compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.560" offset="1882175">So from a common law standpoint, just pure corporate law, he was an employee of that corporation who was handed a W-2 as an employee of the Yates P.C., and it was based on that compensation that his contributions were made to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.338" offset="1941316">In title IV of ERISA, there's an exclusion for plans maintained solely for substantial owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.112" offset="1984366">And the point I'm making, whether you look at title I, title II, or title IV, you see references to sole owners being in there or not... possible ways they could be excluded, but none of them that would prevent them from participating in plans such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.913" offset="2051553">And I think if you look at that, as well as look at the DOL regulatory scheme that has come out of this, the DOL opinion letters before this conclusion, be that 79-08A which is in the record at J.A.... the joint appendix at 271 and 273, the opinion letter 99-04A at 274a and 283a.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.229" offset="2148833">You see an information letter that's actually is part of UNUM Providence brief at appendix 1, and that's a letter from Robert Dole to Susan Hoffman.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.267" offset="2184986">Each of these is where the DOL has opined an opinion that people that are working owners can be a participant in an employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.041" offset="2228140">And so I think the case law on that point is pretty clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.294" offset="2245172">And I think where the confusion comes into play is this definition of employee benefit plan in a reg that has been misread by, I believe, two circuits on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.388" offset="2293551">And I think just a plain reading of the reg in and of itself shows that working owners were intended to be included in these plans if they had another participant in the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.869" offset="2391458">And so just for the policy reasons behind that is I think the preambles to the reg further shed light about the definition of employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.015" offset="2435971">And what the Department of Labor was weighing here was do you really want to have working owners that are the sole owners, sole participants of the plan, have to comply with the ERISA burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.410" offset="2481633">In other words, is there a need to tell the working owner, even though there's no one else in the plan, you need to give yourself a summary plan description?</text>

            <text syncTime="765.532" offset="3062073">And I think if you look at... what the... the holding in the Sixth Circuit, I really think it really creates some policy problems for employee benefit plans that are... are pretty significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.494" offset="3105959">For instance, the holding was that there is an employee benefit plan here which... with the issue you just raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.924" offset="3135634">And then it said, but there's not a participant... Yates is not a participant in that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.225" offset="3156846">So you have this... I don't know what you call it because he's been under one plan document since the passage of the plan, since it was enacted, and so now there's a presumption that this aspect of the plan is governed under State law, even though there's never been a provision provided such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.299" offset="3225182">The plan document is the same plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.118" offset="3232392">And you could very easily get fiduciaries in a situation like this having inconsistent State law claims versus Federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.496" offset="3265933">You could end up having situations that really make no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.697" offset="3286727">And one of the... the primary purposes of ERISA was to avoid the very issue that that would cause and that is they wanted a uniform administrative scheme for all of the States and now there will be, you know, 50 States having different regulatory provisions regarding these plans, plus the Federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.243" offset="3356944">And what if they don't co-exist in consistent remedies?</text>
            <text syncTime="842.808" offset="3371154">And so I think for those reasons, petitioner is asking that Yates be declared a participant in this plan and remand that for further proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.277" offset="3449104">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="871.109" offset="3484421">Hundreds of thousands of shareholders, partners, and sole proprietors who work for the businesses they own are currently covered by benefit plans that also cover other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.717" offset="3526844">All of those different types of working owners are participants subject to the rights and remedies of ERISA, just like the other employees in the plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.859" offset="3555370">And that's clear from the text of ERISA which contains several partial exemptions, which Mr. Holifield referred to some of, for certain plans that cover working owners, and those exemptions presuppose that working owners may be ERISA participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.060" offset="3612212">In addition, working owners have long been eligible to participate, along with other employees, in pension plans qualifying for favorable tax treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.862" offset="3643350">And ERISA was intended to harmonize with those tax provisions and it didn't revoke the ability of working owners to participate in tax qualified plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.407" offset="3677623">Coverage of working owners also furthers ERISA's purposes of ensuring that employee benefit plans are governed by a single set of regulations, of encouraging plan creation, and of protecting plan participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.267" offset="3736973">So there's no question that the other non-owner employees that are covered by plans that also cover working owners are participants subject to the rights and remedies of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.124" offset="3780441">And if the working owners in those plans were not also ERISA participants, they would be subject to different regulations and have different rights and remedies than other employees in the same plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.361" offset="3821401">They might even be prohibited from being covered by the plans at all, and that result would place the coverage provisions of title I of ERISA at war with the tax provisions governing pension plans and with the insurance provisions of title IV of ERISA, both of which cover plans in which working owners participate along with other employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.342" offset="3989316">The... the... it's clear and it's accepted in the opinions below that it is a qualified plan for... for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.651" offset="4018573">But it... there's a strong possibility that if... if the working owner, Dr. Yates, is not an ERISA participant under title I of ERISA, that title I would prohibit him from being in the plan at all, which would be a very anomalous situation because the tax code is encouraging him to be in the plan along with other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.858" offset="4107389">And title I of ERISA would be prohibiting what the tax code encourages, and if it were a defined benefit plan, which this one doesn't happen to be, it would in fact be insured also under title IV of ERISA which insures plans in which working owners participate along with other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.011" offset="4183980">And in addition, allowing working owners to participate along with other employees, as I was alluding to before, advances ERISA's purpose of encouraging employee benefit plans because the ability to participate themselves gives working owners an incentive to establish plans for other workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.101" offset="4252317">It also could create economies of scale in plan administration and investment and it encourages owners to monitor the plans to ensure that they're well managed and that they're well funded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.104" offset="4304353">So for all of those reasons, the Department of Labor has issued the advisory opinion stating that owners can be participants in ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.906" offset="4335595">The IRS and the PBGC share that view, and it's entitled to substantial weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.336" offset="4365270">The... the reason that the court of appeals reached the contrary conclusion is it misread the regulation that Justice Breyer was discussing with Mr. Holifield earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.578" offset="5402227">Justice Breyer, we... we address this issue at the very level that you... you talked about, that first common law level, and we think an important distinction should be made in this case that this case is not about working owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.467" offset="5449770">This case is about one working shareholder, a sole shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.636" offset="5466488">And we think that makes a substantial difference when you get down to the basics of an organization and... and you look at the fiduciary duties a president, a director has to a corporation and you look at the fact that when you have one shareholder, there's one person that that duty is enforceable by, and that's the same person that it applies to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.327" offset="5545273">On the other hand, in this... in this Court's opinion in Clackamas, you had four shareholders, and no matter what their interests were, those shareholders all had fiduciary rights and expectations between themselves and all had the right to enforce those fiduciary obligations amongst them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.077" offset="5616222">So there is some element of control that those other shareholders have when... when you try to separate one down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.053" offset="5644121">But here, at its basic level, Dr. Yates is controlled by no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.132" offset="5664496">So when you start talking about common law applications of master/servant and control, there's no one else to apply it to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.726" offset="8462838">If you're talking in terms of language, what they say is, A, the common law would have considered him an employee of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.156" offset="8492617">B, we have the tax code which says... doesn't happen to throw him in as a member or former member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.472" offset="8517799">It says he's a participant because it says he's an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.360" offset="8529398">We have the Pension Benefit Guaranty code which again refers to him as an employee, and then we have the language of the reg itself which says he's not deemed an employee for purposes of this section, words which wouldn't have been necessary if he fell... didn't fall within it in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.277" offset="8601078">And then it says, for purposes of this section, which certainly suggests that it could mean just purposes of this section, otherwise he's in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.450" offset="8633783">And just to top it, we have that's what the Labor Department thinks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.915" offset="8647576">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.287" offset="8649143">Now, that seems like a pretty good set of considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.473" offset="8665861">I... I would say that under title IV, Justice Breyer, also the same language is there: for purposes of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.583" offset="8690312">Then it defines a substantial owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.441" offset="8697731">So we submit the same limiting language that's in the C.F.R. is also in the provisions of title IV, and... and as the petitioner correctly points out in their brief, title IV does not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.618" offset="8746423">So we think the policies of ERISA are... are furthered when you separate the two and you... you know, where Congress has intended to... to protect employees, and we think when the other provisions of the statute are examined, that... that this one person cannot occupy these two positions of employer and employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.822" offset="9231256">Your Honor, I would just... just point out just a couple quick points here, and that is, there's nothing in ERISA that prevents a person from being or playing or acting in multiple roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.655" offset="9302518">That was contemplated all throughout ERISA and it's in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.217" offset="9312862">Matter of fact, there's nothing preventing Yates P.C. from being the trustee, the plan administrator, the plan sponsor, and having all those roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.679" offset="9346612">This Court in Varity v. Howe dealt with an individual in one speech who was part of the time held to be the employer, part of the time held to be a fiduciary communicating benefits in the same speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.800" offset="9383184">So those roles can happen simultaneously in certain aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.358" offset="9401365">And so I would point that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.033" offset="9408052">And the other thing is... is the term employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.005" offset="9419964">There's nothing preventing a person being an employer and an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.227" offset="9432816">In fact, the definition of employer says anyone acting as an employer, a person acting as an employer, and the definition of persons specifically includes individual, partnerships, joint ventures, corporations, unincorporated organizations, associations, employee organizations, mutual companies, this... this huge laundry list of entities, including down to a single person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.973" offset="9523827">So I'd argue that I don't think there's a question about a person being an employer and even if you assumed Yates was a sole proprietor and still being able to participate in this plan based on the other regulatory provisions and statutes of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.180" offset="9576699">And for those reasons, we'd ask that you reverse the decision of the Sixth Circuit and remand it for further proceedings.</text>
