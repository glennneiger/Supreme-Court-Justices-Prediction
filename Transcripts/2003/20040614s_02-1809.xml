            <label>Justice Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">The opinion of the Court in two cases will be announced by Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.761" offset="22988">The first case is Hibbs versus Winn.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.270" offset="41064">Respondents here plaintiff below, are Arizona tax payers who filed suit in Federal Court against the Director of Arizona’s Department of Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.113" offset="84428">The suit sought to enjoin the operation of a provision of Arizona’s income tax law on First Amendment Establishment Clause grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.396" offset="125492">Arizona’s law authorizes an income tax credit for payment to non-profit school tuition organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.369" offset="161437">Those organizations, called STOs, awards scholarships to students attending private elementary or secondary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.955" offset="199784">Arizona’s statute allows STOs to designate schools that provide religious instruction or maintain religion-based admissions preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.361" offset="245342">The question presented for our review, does a Federal District Court have authority to adjudicate respondent’s constitutional challenge?</text>
            <text syncTime="70.269" offset="280973">To be more specific a federal law, the Tax Injunction Act of TIA, prohibits a Federal District Court from restraining the assessment, levy, or collection of any tax under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.185" offset="340637">Does that Act bar this suit?</text>
            <text syncTime="87.792" offset="351086">Arizona’s Revenue Director thinks it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.952" offset="363729">He moved to dismiss the case urging that a federal injunction would restrain the assessment of taxes under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.988" offset="395912">The District Court agreed and granted the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.787" offset="407092">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed holding that the TIA does not bar the federal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.107" offset="436349">Affirming the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, we now hold that respondent’s suit is not the kind TIA proscribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.697" offset="474697">In decisions spanning a near half century including civil rights challenges, the state action aimed at circumventing ground of the Board of Education, courts in the federal system including this court, as a reviewer of lower court’s decisions have entertained challenges to tax credits authorized by state law without viewing the TIA as a jurisdictional barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.190" offset="576679">On this first occasion squarely to confront the issue, we confirm the authority Federal Court exercised in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.684" offset="610638">The Director argues in effect that we and other Federal Courts were wrong to adjudicate those challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.227" offset="636865">He contends that the TIA trumps 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 which authorizes civil actions for deprivation of federal rights under color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.780" offset="687020">The TIA, the Director maintains, bars all lower court interference with state tax systems even when the plaintiff is not trying to avoid paying the tax imposed on him and no matter that the state revenue would increase should the plaintiff prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.139" offset="764552">The alleged jurisdictional bar which the Director asserts has existed since the TIA’s enactment in 1937, was not even imagined by juror’s in pathmarking civil rights cases just mentioned, or by the defendants in those cases who had every interest in defeating Federal Court adjuticatorial authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.841" offset="851278">Our prior decisions command no respect, the Director maintains, because they are mere silent holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.840" offset="879282">We reject that assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.855" offset="887327">This suit implicates neither the TIA’s conception of the tax assessment nor any of the Act’s underlying purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.765" offset="918988">Taking account of the prospective nature of the relief requested, does respondent’s suit in the TIA’s words seek to enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or collection of any tax under state law?</text>
            <text syncTime="244.606" offset="978338">The answer turns on the meaning of the term assessment as employed in the TIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.501" offset="997982">For Internal Revenue Code purposes an assessment involves a recording of the amount the tax payer owes the government, rather than reading the word assessment in isolation, we follow the cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.768" offset="1067050">In the TIA and tax law generally, an assessment is closely tied to the collection of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.467" offset="1093799">The assessment is the official recording of liability that triggers levy and collection efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.744" offset="1118877">A court should also interpret the statute to effectuate all its provisions, if as the Director asserts, the term assessment by itself signify the entire plan of taxation the TIA would not need the words levy or collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.491" offset="1185959">The term assessment alone would do all the necessary work.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.158" offset="1204558">Just as another federal statute, the Anti-Injunction Act shields federal tax collections from Federal Court injunctions, so the TIA shields state tax collections from Federal Court restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.914" offset="1259624">In both statutes, Congress directed tax payers to pursue refund suits instead of attempting to restrain collections.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.544" offset="1294106">Third party actions not seeking to stop the collection of the tax imposed on the plaintiff or outside Congress’ fair view.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.022" offset="1332036">In enacting the TIA, Congress trained its attention on tax payers who sought to avoid paying their tax bill by pursuing a challenge route other than the one specified by the taxing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.729" offset="1386893">No where does the tax of the Act or its legislative history announce a sweeping congressional direction to prevent, in the director’s words, Federal Court interference with any aspect of state tax administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.426" offset="1445616">This understanding underpins our case law relevant to the TIA and the decisions of other Federal Courts as well consistent with the decades long understanding prevailing on this issue, respondent’s suit may proceed without any TIA impediment.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.061" offset="1520222">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice, Justices Scalia and Thomas join.</text>
