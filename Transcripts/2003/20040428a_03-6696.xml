            <text syncTime="32.928" offset="131657">First, the Fourth Circuit wrongly prevented Hamdi in this habeas proceeding from being heard as to the facts of the case on grounds that allowing him to be heard would interfere with executive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.453" offset="189753">Second, that the Fourth Circuit erred in finding even on the one-sided record that's before this Court that his detention is authorized by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.925" offset="231654">The historical core of habeas corpus is to challenge extrajudicial executive detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.082" offset="260284">It cannot be a violation of the separation of powers for an Article III court to perform its judicial function of inquiry into long-term, indefinite detention of a citizen in a habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.448" offset="325695">Quoting from INS v. St. Cyr, at its historical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2570.098" offset="10280333">We also think it appropriate for the United States to come in with a declaration that explains the basis for the military's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.444" offset="11301721">I understand for arresting on the battlefield, that's perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.211" offset="11316767">But is this prolonged detention for that purpose the subject of judicial writing anywhere that you know about?</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.444" offset="11349682">Let me answer both parts of your question, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.636" offset="11358459">Certainly it has occurred to us and we have considered the possibility that in some circumstances with some individuals, the best way to get them to cooperate and provide information is to give them a lawyer who will tell them, boy, you know, it's in your best interest to plead to this relatively minor material support charge or whatever and provide the Government with everything that you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.950" offset="11443722">And that is part of the answer to Justice Ginsburg's earlier question, is why is it that there is this pattern that you look at and some people are used in the Article III system and other people are prosecuted or dealt with in preventative detention in the military system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.225" offset="11500878">And it reflects a judgment by people whose job it is to make these judgments that certain people, the best way to get them to cooperate, or maybe with certain individuals after you've gotten a certain amount of information from them, but you feel there is one other area you're not going to get unless the dynamic fundamentally changes, those people may be best dealt with in the way that you envisioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.595" offset="11578305">Whereas other individuals, the only way that the judgment of the intelligence experts had to deal with them is to provide them without counsel and to use an interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.033" offset="11624072">I think to your second point of the question, I don't know that there are any authorities that I'm aware of that address exactly what you're talking about, but I think there are two types of authority that we would point to as being very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.934" offset="11671719">First of all, it's long been recognized that one of the major justifications for the detention of enemy combatants or prisoners of war is to gather intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.512" offset="11709962">And we cite some sources to that effect in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.117" offset="11720411">The second thing, and I think this is important, is that it has never been the case that prisoners of war are entitled to counsel to challenge their capture or their detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.444" offset="11761685">What has happened historically, and what the Geneva Convention provides, is that if one of those enemy combatants is charged with a specific war crime, then at that point they're entitled to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.166" offset="11804630">But if they are just being held in a preventative detention, then in that circumstance, they are not entitled to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.820" offset="11883207">A couple of responses, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.183" offset="11888640">First of all, in the midst of any war, the detention may seem like it's indefinite because if you talk about a detainee in 1942, they're not going to know how long World War II is going to last.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.252" offset="11932944">And their detention may seem indefinite but those detentions have always been approved under the law of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.797" offset="11955096">Second, with respect to Al Qaeda and individuals who are hard core Al Qaeda operatives, the end of the war is a very difficult thing to perceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.931" offset="11987696">But with respect to somebody who is captured on the battlefield with the Taliban, this war may eventually... the executive may make the judgment or Congress may help us make the judgment that the war in Afghanistan is effectively over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.456" offset="12045793">And individuals who only really posed a danger of rejoining the battle in Afghanistan would be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.245" offset="12072960">Now, there may be a few individuals who, as I say, are hard core Al Qaeda operatives and they're going to join the battle against the United States wherever it's waged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.898" offset="12103576">They're just in Afghanistan because that's where the action is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.364" offset="12253414">--Justice Ginsburg, I actually have the sense that the torture victims... you have the Torture Victim Protection Act, of course, which I think doesn't actually apply to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.825" offset="12291239">So I'm not sure that there would be any other basis for bringing a private cause of action against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.203" offset="12312764">But as this Court noted in footnote 14 of the Eisentrager opinion, the idea that a treaty is going to be enforced through means other than a private cause of action doesn't mean that it's not a binding treaty, doesn't mean that it's not going to constrain the actions of the executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.128" offset="12368457">Just to finish up my answer to Justice Stevens' question, I wouldn't want there to be any misunderstanding about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.993" offset="12387892">It's also the judgment of those involved in this process that the last thing you want to do is torture somebody or try to do something along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.933" offset="12431673">I mean, if there were an artificial... if you did that, you might get information more quickly, but you would really wonder about the reliability of the information you were getting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.534" offset="12462080">So the judgment of the people who do this as their responsibility is that the way you would get the best information from individuals is that you interrogate them, you try to develop a relationship of trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.939" offset="12851722">One is, I don't think there is any contradiction with that and my answer to Justice Breyer's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.124" offset="12868441">I mean, you can imagine a situation where the evidence in the Government's own affidavit shows that somebody is only detained with regard to war in Afghanistan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.601" offset="12906371">And then you can imagine that that has been signed, sealed and delivered, it's over, the President says so, Congress says so and there is an effort to continue to detain that individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.669" offset="12938658">I can imagine it and I can also imagine that the concern about Afghanistan will go on as long as there is concern about Al Qaeda, and there is no endpoint that we can see at this point to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.142" offset="12980558">So that it seems to me your answer boils down to saying, don't worry about the timing question, we'll tell you when it's over.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.477" offset="13045864">I'm taking away from the argument the impression, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that you think there is a continuing role for the courts to examine the reasonableness of the period of detention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.633" offset="13106469">What I'm saying is there is a continuing but modest role for the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.197" offset="13124754">The habeas courts will remain open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.105" offset="13132382">I mean, the import of one of Justice Souter's questions is that it's already too long and if somebody raised that claim, if there is another petition filed, a direct petition now that Hamdi has counsel that's filed in this claim, and that claim is raised, we would be in court vehemently saying there is no role for the habeas court there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.175" offset="13212630">There are troops still on the ground in Afghanistan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.516" offset="13222034">It makes no sense whatsoever to release an individual detained as an enemy combatant in Afghanistan while the troops are still on the ground in Afghanistan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.773" offset="13362991">It's the original screening team on the ground in Afghanistan that, as I said before, released 10,000 individuals out of U.S. custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.924" offset="13395696">It's the screening team in Guantanamo and then it is this annual review process that will go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.035" offset="13500082">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.511" offset="13506038">Mr. Clement is a worthy advocate and he can stand up here and make the unreasonable sound reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.250" offset="13532996">But when you take his argument at core, it is, "Trust us".</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.965" offset="13551804">And who is saying trust us?</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.057" offset="13560163">The executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.550" offset="13566119">And why do we have the great writ?</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.073" offset="13576255">We have the great writ because we didn't trust the executive branch when we founded this Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.038" offset="13596108">That's why the Government is saying trust us is no excuse for taking away and driving a truck through the right of habeas corpus and the Fifth Amendment that no man shall be deprived of liberty except upon due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.785" offset="13647099">We have a small problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.313" offset="13653159">One citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.425" offset="13657652">We're not talking about thousands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.599" offset="13666325">One citizen caught up in a problem in Afghanistan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.953" offset="13679804">Is it better to give him rights or is it better to start a new dawn of saying there are circumstances where you can't file a writ of habeas corpus and there are circumstances where you can't get due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.859" offset="13723376">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.020" offset="13728078">I would urge the Court not to go down that road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.042" offset="13740095">I would urge the Court to find that citizens can only be detained by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.254" offset="13760993">And here there is no law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.444" offset="13769770">If there is any law at all, it is the executive's own secret definition of whatever enemy combatant is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.120" offset="13792444">And don't fool yourselves into thinking that that means somebody coming off a battlefield because they've used it in Chicago, they've used it in New York and they've used it in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.297" offset="13833091">The Congress needs to act here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.155" offset="13840614">Justice Souter was on point when he was talking about the fact that we're two years into this thing and Congress leaves all the laws on the books that relate to habeas corpus and how a habeas corpus proceeding is supposed to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.324" offset="13889202">They leave the 4001(a) on the books that says no executive detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.755" offset="13906965">But we ignore those laws, we don't enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.279" offset="13917100">We don't require Congress to fill a gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.803" offset="13927131">Congress tomorrow could take these military regs and they could say, this is the law, we authorize the executive to detain people and to give them hearings the way the military says, and then it would be lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.969" offset="13975824">But Congress hasn't done that and I respectfully submit, Your Honor, that until Congress does that, these detentions are not lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.962" offset="14015843">And I would respectfully ask this Court to step up to the plate and say so.</text>
