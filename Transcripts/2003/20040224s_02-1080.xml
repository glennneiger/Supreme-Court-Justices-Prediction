            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="4.709" offset="18808">The first of the two is No. 02-1080, General Dynamics Land Systems against Cline.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.442" offset="53708">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.078" offset="68232">In 1997 a collective bargaining agreement between petitioner, General Dynamics, and United Auto Workers eliminated the company’s obligation to provide health benefits to subsequently retired employees except as to then current workers at least 50 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.668" offset="138658">Respondents are a group of workers under 50 who brought this action in Federal Court under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.666" offset="174602">They challenge the favorable treatment of the older employees on a theory of what the District Court called reverse age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.034" offset="204069">The Court observed that no court had ever granted relief under the ADEA on such a claim and dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.200" offset="232699">On appeal, a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed with the majority reasoning that the ADEA’s prohibition of discrimination against “any individual because of such individual’s age” is so clear in its face that if Congress had meant to limit its coverage to protect only the older worker against the younger, it would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.508" offset="317962">We granted certiorari to resolve the resulting conflict among the Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.954" offset="347742">In an opinion filed today with he Clerk of the Court, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.165" offset="364565">The common ground in this case that the ADEA forbids discriminatory preference for the young over the old.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.670" offset="390583">The question is whether it also prohibits favoring the old over the young.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.640" offset="410540">In the abstract, the ADEA’s reference simply to age could be read either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.834" offset="435304">The more expansive possible understanding does not however square over the natural reading of the whole provision prohibiting discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.655" offset="470518">In common experience along with the congressional testimony, reports, and findings simply confirm that Congress used the phrase discrimination because of an individual’s age the same way that ordinary people in common usage might speak of age discrimination any day of the week.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.093" offset="532271">That is as showing that the statute does not mean to stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.608" offset="566335">Justice Scalia filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Thomas has also filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Kennedy joins.</text>
