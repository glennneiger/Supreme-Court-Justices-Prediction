            <text syncTime="8.545" offset="34168">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.857" offset="43363">Unlike the two cases in which you heard argument yesterday, and unlike Oregon v. Elstad, the original inculpatory statement in this case was elicited not merely in violation of a prophylactic rule, but of the Constitution itself, specifically the Sixth Amendment right of an accused to the assistance of counsel throughout his criminal prosecution, a right designed to protect equality in the adversarial process by a--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="39.731" offset="158824">What is your authority, Mr. Waxman, for saying that this is different from the Miranda warnings in the sense that it's... it's an immediate violation rather than something... something like Miranda?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="51.498" stopTime="175.874">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="51.498" offset="205949">--Well, it's... Your Honor, I guess I have a two-fold answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.842" offset="219324">First of all, the... the constitutional right involved is the Sixth Amendment right, unlike in Miranda, the Fifth Amendment right of self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.848" offset="251298">And in... in Oregon v. Elstad and Chavez v. Martinez, this Court recognized that although the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination right is not completed until the statement or its fruits are introduced at trial, the primary illegality, as this Court has used the phrase, is the coercion of the confession, and the Elstad rule doesn't apply where the primary illegality is constitutionally-proscribed conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.767" offset="375014">And here, this Court has not formally decided whether the Sixth Amendment is violated at the time the uncounseled, post-indictment statement is deliberately elicited, or only when the statement or fruits are admitted, that briefs of both sides rehearse for the Court somewhat conflicting statements in different opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.985" offset="467905">We rely on the cases cited in footnote 5 on page 8 of our reply brief, but for purposes of this case, Your Honor, it doesn't matter, because in Elstad, this Court made clear, and reiterated in Chavez, that although the Fifth Amendment violation is incomplete at the time a confession is coerced, nonetheless the fruits of that confession have to be suppressed under the derivative evidence rule, unless the Government carries its burden to prove sufficient attenuation of taint.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.958" offset="595801">And therefore, even if the conduct deliberately eliciting from Mr. Fellers his inculpatory statement at a time when the officers knew he had been indicted, and the prosecution knew that he had a right to the advice of counsel, the fruits of that statement under Nix and Wade have to be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.475" offset="677825">That's a rule that this Court has applied in Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and Sixth Amendment cases.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="175.874" offset="703425">Do police officers generally know this distinction, that when an indictment has been handed down, suddenly the Sixth Amendment is in the case as well as the Fifth?</text>
            <text syncTime="185.905" offset="743549">There's an element of fiction to it in that the person doesn't have a lawyer yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.221" offset="768836">As a bright line rule, I guess, we need some point to know when proceedings have commenced, but I... I still think there's an element of fiction in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.644" offset="802482">Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't... I don't think I would call it fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.782" offset="815125">I'm no more able to... to testify than the member of this Court would be as to exactly what training the police are told.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.386" offset="841456">But this Court has long established, long maintained that the Sixth Amendment cuts very bright lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.477" offset="873848">It is specific to the offense and it begins only when, but when, the state makes the unilateral determination to change its formal relationship with an individual from one in which the individual may or may not be under investigation, but the--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="236.104" offset="944379">Mr. Waxman, you... you're making a... a very technical distinction, if I understand you correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.906" offset="975621">If we focus on the suspect in the case of no indictment yet, who has been arrested, and the person who has been indicted and then arrested, and they're both alone with the same police officers in the same jail cell, and they're both subjected to the same interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.229" offset="1068826">Why should the derivative evidence rule apply to the one or not the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.228" offset="1104875">If we're talking about constitutional rights, it seems to me that these two individuals are similarly situated.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.998" offset="1131938">--Well, they... they aren't, Your Honor, and I don't think this is a matter of technicality or formality.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.571" offset="1154194">It is a matter of formalism, but the two different amendments... the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel throughout criminal prosecution, protect very different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.143" offset="1212500">The first protects voluntariness, and the second protects the right of someone as to whom the Government has formally set its face and invoked a formal adversarial process.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.633" offset="1270491">The point is why... why should that make a difference other than the convenience of the bright line?</text>
            <text syncTime="321.925" offset="1287628">As in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, it could be the same drug ring, the same investigation, just the grand jury has... hasn't got around to indicting the second defendant until the next day and then their rights are different.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.865" offset="1331409">Your... Your Honor, it's... it is entirely true that if the Court agrees with... agrees with our submission here, that the Government can very easily conform its conduct simply by not conducting uncounseled interrogations or elicitations prior to changing its status.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.812" offset="1407164">But the... the... we have to examine, this Court has exhorted counsel over and over again to be clear about what the underlying right is protected in determining what the appropriate remedy is.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.514" offset="1453976">And the right here is not coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.045" offset="1468082">The right here is not just addressed at police.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.745" offset="1478949">It's addressed at the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.587" offset="1486263">And there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.445" offset="1493682">You may call it technical, but it is in fact the hallmark of our adversary system that once the Government decides to invoke a formal adversary process, it proceeds on the supposition that each side deals with each other, A, at arm's length, and B, assisted by the advice of counsel, who will prevent each side, and in particularly the defendant, from, as this Court has explained in... from conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his legal and constitutional rights, and that's what's being protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.996" offset="1631922">The unindicted individual, as to whom the Government may be conducting an investigation, doesn't have that formal right, but once the Government invokes our adversarial system, it invokes a set of protections that protect, not an individual's right to be protected from coercion or involuntariness... that's protected no matter when the custodial--</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.388" offset="7529535">The court did say that under Patterson, the Sixth Amendment argument that petitioner is making in this Court doesn't get out of the starting gate, because there was no interrogation, it used the word interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.361" offset="7577391">There was an issue about whether interrogation is equivalent to deliberate elicitation, and I'll try to address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.562" offset="7598184">But before the court got to the Sixth Amendment question, it addressed on pages 121 and 122 of the joint appendix the argument based on Elstad, and the argument that the petitioner made was that the statements made at the jailhouse should be suppressed... and this is on page 121 of the joint appendix... because the primary taint of the improperly elicited statements made at his home was not removed by the recitation of his Miranda rights at the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.377" offset="7729424">And then the court went on to discuss Oregon v. Elstad in detail and rejected that holding, that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.058" offset="7760144">And the way that I interpret that passage is that the court affirmed the district court's explicit finding of a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver, and applied Elstad to reject that claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2309.022" offset="9236062">The deliberate elicitation standard, as so phrased, gives rise to some confusion, because it does suggest that there's a subjective component to it, where deliberate elicitation does have a different application than interrogation for purposes of Miranda with respect to undercover agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.598" offset="9310354">The Court has made clear that once a suspect is indicted, the police cannot use an undercover agent, not known or identified as such to the defendant, to circumvent his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.455" offset="9353718">And in that respect, deliberate elicitation is broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.633" offset="9366465">But in footnote 12 of Maine v. Moulton where the Court was discussing deliberate elicitation in some detail, the Court made clear that intent is hard to prove, and it's really not the main issue here anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.604" offset="9414322">What we should be interested in is whether the Government must have known that its conduct would be likely to elicit incriminating statements, and that is essentially the same as the Rhode Island v. Innis standard for interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.517" offset="9470015">In fact, it's a little bit more onerous for the defendant, because it says, must have known, and the Rhode Island v. Innis standard is should have known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.881" offset="9499481">In any event, the Government submits that the Court should make it clearer that when you're dealing with identified police officers interacting with suspects post-indictment, the Rhode Island v.

            <text syncTime="2761.888" offset="11047497">The first is that the right that the defendant did not get, by hypothesis now, at home, was the right to make an informed waiver of the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.104" offset="11096398">When the defendant got the Miranda warnings at home, that fully cured any deficiency in knowledge that the defendant previously had about his right to counsel, and enabled him to make an act of free will that broke any causal link between the first statements and the second statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.416" offset="11177587">And the second crucial reason why Elstad should apply here is Elstad is not simply limited to reasoning that is only applicable in the context of compulsion under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.426" offset="11225652">It also clearly and explicitly said, it's very speculative and attenuated to posit that a defendant who spoke at one time is therefore going to believe that the cat is out of the bag and I should speak again, I don't really have a choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.086" offset="13200300">No, I don't think it's strange at all, because as the Court explained in Patterson, the question of a waiver is a functional question that turns on what the role of counsel might be at a particular setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.124" offset="13236454">Now, the role of counsel at trial is considerably more complex in dealing with evidentiary matters and legal claims than the role in pre-trial interrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.717" offset="13286818">Well, in this particular case, and this is my third and final point, if the Court should determine that the waiver of rights is not a per se independent act that attenuates any taint, on any record the Court should not find that there is any taint that is unattenuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.268" offset="13353064">The violation at home, if there was any, was an extremely mild violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.098" offset="13372291">If the defendant let the cat out of the bag, it was really at most one paw, not an entire cat.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.830" offset="13399249">The... the defendant barely spoke at all about his activities relating to the charges that were identified in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.489" offset="13437910">He said that he had business and personal problems and he was a methamphetamine user, and he rambled on for a while until the police cut him off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.868" offset="13471451">At the station house, he was asked specifically person by person what his relationship was with the individual and what the activities were, and of course, he gave more elaborate information at that time, but... and this is critical too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.615" offset="13526413">It was not information that admitted the charges in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.496" offset="13541982">This wasn't a case where a defendant said, well, I've confessed once, I might as well confess again now that I have my Miranda warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.979" offset="13567896">This was an individual who spoke about his problems at his home, then he gets down to the station house and he's essentially talking about all the things that make him not liable, criminally liable under the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.413" offset="13613558">It was an instance in which, I would submit, the motive for the defendant to talk was not that the cat was out of the bag, but that he was hoping to minimize any suggestion of guilt and persuade the officers that the indictment was not properly founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.159" offset="13668624">And finally, of course, the officers never exploited any prior statement and they did give him a thorough, complete administration of Miranda warnings, and under the circumstances of this case, even if the Court were to apply a taint analysis sometimes, or to assume that a taint analysis applies, the facts of this case demonstrate enough attenuation so that the jailhouse statements should be admitted, while the statements at home were suppressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3460.377" offset="13841450">But the case of a defendant's own voluntary statements should be treated as a special case under a fruits rule in which there is per se attenuation in the form of an independent act of free will that intervenes between the violation and the ensuing waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.953" offset="13915742">And that comes about when the defendant receives full and complete information about his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.063" offset="13940193">There is no suggestion of involuntariness in his waiver and he decides to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.432" offset="13961718">The ultimate test in attenuation law is was there an independent act of free will when you're speaking of a confession that breaks the causal link to the prior illegality.</text>
