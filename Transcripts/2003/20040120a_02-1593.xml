            <text syncTime="39.464" offset="157780">Now, the purpose of the Pittman Act was to develop the State of Nevada by granting private land to citizens who made personal sacrifices to discover and develop underground sources of water that was not... that were not previously known.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.443" offset="613669">At that time, the... the expectation of how this... how these materials would be developed, whatever was reserved as valuable minerals, was under the 1872 Mining Law which itself applied to valuable minerals.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.056" offset="752222">It didn't say valuable minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.898" offset="759536">It said, valuable mineral deposits, and there's a significant difference between... a lump of silver might be tremendously valuable, but it wouldn't be a deposit if that's all there was.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.158" offset="808542">--Your Honor is... is correct that valuable mineral deposits is the... is the language referred to in... in 30 U.S.C., section 22 of the 1872 Mining Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.561" offset="850233">30 U.S.C., section 21 actually refers to valuable mineral lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.897" offset="867579">And those terms were really viewed as quite similar by the Interior Department at the time, and the question was whether a particular type of mineral was... was within the class of minerals that the 1872 Mining Law was subject to.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.387" offset="925466">And in 1919, if an individual sought to establish a mining claim for common sand and gravel, claiming a discovery of valuable minerals in 1919, it is quite clear and certain how the Interior Department would have addressed that in 1919.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.906" offset="987533">Interior would have quickly denied the patent and rejected the application of the 1872 Mining Law to common sand and gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.535" offset="1022119">Now, we know that because we can look to the published Interior Department decisions of the day which were published at that time, as they are now, available for citizens, as well as the Congress to... to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.031" offset="1076036">And the repeated decisions from 1901, in particular, through 1919 made it very clear that common earthen materials, such as clay, sand and gravel, used for road base, cement-making purposes, things of that nature, were simply not subject to the... the Mining Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.183" offset="1224725">And under that modified view, adopted by Interior in 1929 in the Layman v. Ellis decision, it confirmed the importance of assessing the marketability on a site-specific basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.353" offset="1313332">And then in 1956, the Interior Department, looking at the... at the position that Layman v. Ellis took, applied that in the context of a mineral reservation, as we have here, and said in the context of a mineral reservation, if it's to include these... these common materials, it can only include those materials when there is value at the time of the patent.</text>

Ellis decision in... in 1929, looking at the site-specific marketability of sand and gravel, because unlike a precious metal like gold which, once you extract it, it can be sold on an international market without regard to transportation costs and has intrinsic value, sand and gravel and... and similar materials are... are common and widespread across the western public domain and, in fact, across the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.666" offset="7762651">That's why, to make their argument, they say that Western Nuclear was certainly wrong and therefore what we should do is limit it by turning everything on the word valuable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.625" offset="12358426">So used for commercial purposes, the concept of value is definitely part of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act, and consequently, it means the mineral must be valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.913" offset="12395624">In Pittman, you've got again the exact same language of section 8 and section 9 with the addition of the word valuable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.918" offset="12643579">But if there's a possibility here that the Government can come in and start digging, because the mixture of organic only goes down about 6 inches, and if everything below that 6 inches potentially belongs to the Government, and the Government can come in and tear up even that 6 inches to look for rocks or look for sand or look for gravel or granite or all that stuff, which is undoubtedly there, I just don't know what I'm getting into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.955" offset="12751726">And therefore, I would be pretty reluctant to buy this piece of land, or at least not for much of a price.</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.043" offset="14200163">--I have great respect for my opponent, Mr. Sansonetti, but I... I think that this point that I'm making is... is as clear as could be in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.807" offset="14231197">And the Zimmerman case is not an isolated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.772" offset="14247079">It's merely a case in 1910 that is stating this very explicitly in the case of sand and gravel that this was actually the general understanding and that the Department was not even receiving applications for sand and gravel mining claims because this was so well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.906" offset="14303608">It was not until 1929 in the Layman v. Ellis decision where the Department changed that rule, 10 years after the Pittman Act in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.442" offset="14333701">Then it was determined on a site-specific basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.414" offset="14345613">That's the site-specific base... basis argument that we are putting forward here, which then was adopted in the 1956 solicitor's opinion in the context of mineral reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.611" offset="14386364">There was some reference to the Soderberg case of this Court in 1903.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.069" offset="14404232">That involved valuable granite building stone of the type that we see here in the Jefferson Memorial and around this city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.674" offset="14430668">Not... it was not a surprising ruling when this Court upheld the position of the Interior Department patent that valuable granite could be subject to the Mining Law within the class of valuable minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.986" offset="14475912">By then, in 1897, in the Pacific Coast Marble case, the Interior Department had already ruled that marble was a valuable mineral, which is an eminently sound ruling looking at the marble in this Court building, which is quite different from common sand and gravel.</text>
