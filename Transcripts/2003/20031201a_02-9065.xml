            <label>Ms. Corinne A. Beckwith</label>
            <text syncTime="70.012" offset="280033">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.304" offset="297169">The petitioner in this case, Shakur Muhammad, is a state prisoner who has brought a civil rights action alleging that a prison guard framed him on a false disciplinary charge in retaliation for his having exercised his constitutional right to seek redress in the courts for this same prison guard's previous misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.963" offset="371775">For three reasons, this Court should not graft onto this type of Section 1983 claim a favorable termination requirement that would make this prisoner have to win his claim in another forum before he can seek his remedy in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.505" offset="426005">First, the favorable termination requirement is a habeas protecting advice... device... that was borne of this Court's recognition that Congress would not have wanted a general civil rights action to be the vehicle for undoing a state criminal judgment, particularly given the more specific habeas exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.285" offset="501133">Second, extending the favorable termination requirement beyond this original rationale lacks any basis in the statute's terms or history, and it's devoid of the kind of common law pedigree that might suggest Congress envisioned a broader application to cases that do not look like habeas cases in that they don't involve a direct or an indirect challenge to the fact or duration of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.094" offset="600294">And finally, any remaining qualms about Congress' intent are resolved by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, where, after carefully weighing the interests of overburdened courts and of prison officials, Congress imposed an administrative exhaustion requirement, not a favorable termination requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.572" offset="682214">I'm having an awfully hard time understanding this case, and... and it seemed to me what had happened was that the... your client, who's certainly well represented, he is sitting there at lunch and he makes some faces or gestures and the prison guard then has him up for a couple of charges and he basically is acquitted of the more serious one and they punish him for the more... less serious, threatening behavior, no, it's insolence or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.910" offset="811572">He never says a word about retaliation, never says a word about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.353" offset="829336">He never appeals, which he could have done, his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.182" offset="848666">He never says to the prison authorities, hey, throw this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.102" offset="864340">The whole thing was based on the guard's desire to retaliate.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.984" offset="879909">And now suddenly have his... not having done any of that, we're in Federal court, and the Federal magistrate says, you know, he has no evidence of retaliation, or at least not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.674" offset="922645">And now we're up here arguing about Heck v. Humphrey, sort of like the Finnegan's Wake of the habeas corpus law, and I... I can't really understand how we even got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.820" offset="967262">I... I don't understand why, if you're right, this isn't an unexhausted claim, or at least the magistrate said you don't... your client, unfortunately for him, has not enough evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.344" offset="1273313">We have, you know, Preiser v. Rodriguez, which set up the way, you know, followed up on by Heck v. Humphrey, the way that we decide which way these cases should go.</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.328" offset="14021277">Turning to the actual question presented in this case, there is no justification for the Sixth Circuit's rule extending the Heck favorable termination requirement to prison hearings that don't involve the fact or duration of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.726" offset="14082821">Congress could have amended 1983 to say that, but we know from the PLRA they looked at the same considerations, they did something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.611" offset="14114377">The Sixth Circuit is an outlier here, as Justice O'Connor said, because there's no... there's no conflict with habeas in a... in a matter like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.527" offset="14150008">As to all of the other questions that have come up during this argument, this case came to this Court in the posture where there were no good-time credits and there was no exhaustion question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.044" offset="14196088">Now, we think we can overcome those problems, but I don't think this Court needs to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.131" offset="14212493">And the... the government has never cited any laws that says the guard's retaliatory conduct violating Mr. Muhammad's First Amendment rights would have been a defense, and we know of none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.930" offset="14263693">They argued that it was... it was relevant to credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.902" offset="14275605">They argued that that was some kind of a but-for relationship, but victory in the 1983 suit does not affect the adjudication for insolence in this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.766" offset="14314998">All of this only matters if good-time credits are at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.110" offset="14328372">And putting all of that aside, we just agree with Justice Breyer that then this is an easy case in our favor.</text>
