            <text syncTime="134.861" offset="539376">That is, in the absence of the rule being a jurisdictional one, the Court has the option of considering either of two grounds for reversing and reinstating the dismissal, just as the Court did in the sovereign immunity case involving Israel last year where there were two alternative grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.664" offset="766642">That's not a jurisdictional question, and therefore it remains open to this Court to do what we think the Court should do, which is also to address the question that is directly dividing the circuits, what is the scope of section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.321" offset="825260">Mr. Taranto, you made a...  an interesting classification, and I think I tend to agree with it, but I'm not sure that these Court's cases fit that mold.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.004" offset="871967">I had thought that the things that are put under the head of, quote, prudential standing sound like does this person have a claim under this statute for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.688" offset="918674">That's a 12(b)(6) question.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.296" offset="925153">But the Court seems to have...  think that there's something in between constitutional standing, which everyone agrees exists here, and 12(b)(6), and that's this prudential standing notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.671" offset="978651">Is there a difference between the 12(b)(6) inquiry, does this statute afford this plaintiff a claim for relief, and what this Court has called prudential standing?</text>

            <text syncTime="256.642" offset="1026508">The best that I can do with that is to describe what the Court has done in the cases that we rely on for saying there's no statutory standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.045" offset="1068095">Associated General Contractors and Illinois Brick and its follow-on, Kansas against UtiliCorp, are all about the interpretation of section 4 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.093" offset="1108323">In that sense, they are classic 12(b)(6) questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.875" offset="1123474">The entire analysis in Associated General Contractors is about what the term injury to business or property means.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.388" offset="1153463">They are interpretive questions in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.450" offset="1161718">They're not separate prudential standing questions somewhere between constitutional standing and statutory coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.284" offset="1197035">And that's why we think it is both proper and really quite important for purposes of the several other circuit cases that are now sitting in cert petitions in this Court on the merits question that divides the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.773" offset="1255027">There is no section 2 duty on the merits now to turn over your sales to a rival.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.492" offset="1285956">This Court said, as far back as 1920 in the U.S. Steel case, section 2 does not condemn mere size.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.801" offset="1315109">Section 2 does not compel competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.349" offset="1329319">The 1996 act does.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.133" offset="1340500">It has a quite different policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.717" offset="1350844">It says we will mandate creation of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.547" offset="1370175">Section 2 says we protect against affirmative interferences in independently arising competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.835" offset="1407269">They're fundamentally different statutory approaches to a highly general goal of competition.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Taranto</label>

            <text syncTime="367.067" offset="1468186">It is...  all of the claims in this case, all of the facts allege inadequate help to rivals to come and displace one's own sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.046" offset="1512176">This Court has broadly recognized that section 2 protects the right to just make your sales and not turn them over to rivals with a category of exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.955" offset="1551778">Every one of those exceptions, the refusal to deal cases, involves discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.195" offset="1572780">The firm was voluntarily in the business of selling the product that the plaintiff wanted, and the plaintiff wanted it at the terms that the firm was selling it to others, and the defendant said, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.149" offset="1636519">That threshold condition has so far been the only sufficiently reliable one to trigger the inquiry, if you're selling it to some...  to everybody else, why not to the particular plaintiff?</text>
            <text syncTime="424.197" offset="1696705">And the answer, we're not selling to the plaintiff because the plaintiff is a rival or the plaintiff is dealing with a rival, has been the one exception to the general rule that forced sales to help rivals is not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.378" offset="1761489">Discrimination doesn't mean that...  mean illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.836" offset="1779252">There may be good reasons, but it so far has been the necessary threshold condition for demanding an inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.524" offset="1806002">This case does not involve any kind of discrimination like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.468" offset="1829825">There's no allegation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.204" offset="1836722">There couldn't be an allegation that Verizon was in the business of renting out its facilities to rivals at specially discounted prices before the 1996 act compelled that.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.669" offset="1886668">So for Trinko to prevail here, it would have to...  the Court would have to recognize something brand new under section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.585" offset="1922299">It would have to expand section 2 to where it has never been before, and we submit there are extremely good reasons for not doing that.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.012" offset="1972036">Before you say the reasons against expansion, I'd just like to hear 30 seconds on why in your opinion Otter Tail is different than this.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.793" offset="2011115">Otter Tail was also a case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.387" offset="2025535">If...  the opinion in Otter...  in Otter Tail is a little bit shy on full explanation for what factors matter, and so one has to look at what the facts were.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.674" offset="2062629">If you look at the extensive findings of fact by the district judge, which are in the...  not the appendix of this case but the appendix in Otter Tail, there's an entire section called discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.654" offset="2106514">Otter Tail at...  at J.A. 103 to 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.536" offset="2122083">Otter Tail was undisputedly in the business of wholesaling power and of wheeling power to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.657" offset="2158550">When particular communities came and said we want from you the same thing that you're happily selling to others, Otter Tail said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.045" offset="2196167">That's exactly the same kind of discrimination that existed in Aspen Skiing where the three mountain defendants said, we won't even take full price ski tickets from people who are using the fourth mountain because that's a rival.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.313" offset="2253218">So discrimination was the predicate there too.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.573" offset="2266279">This is not a case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.461" offset="2277773">In the absence of discrimination, any court entertaining a section 2 duty would have to undertake tasks that antitrust has never viewed as appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.350" offset="2325316">It would have to ask what are the effects on long-run investments, the long-term effects on investments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.387" offset="5773479">Actually we submit, Justice Kennedy, that what the Communications Act does is something that the antitrust laws never did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.425" offset="5809633">And the reason that the Communications Act was in...  in fact necessary to break up the monopolies, to cause legitimate, lawful monopolies to do something that the antitrust laws wouldn't require, that is, to open up their markets, which they had no obligation under the antitrust laws to do, at a subsidized rate to invite in competition...  that entire regulatory scheme was something that Congress decided was necessary to do which no other laws in existence had been able to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.313" offset="5929169">Therefore, not only...  and I think that this is clear from the Court's jurisprudence as well, but also well articulated in the Town of Concord decision that was authored by Justice Breyer on the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.779" offset="5979115">That regulatory regime, which monitors the conduct on an ongoing basis, which the antitrust laws are not well equipped to do, prevents the occurrence of antitrust injury and inhibits the ability to accomplish antitrust benefits and monitors the process in a way that succeeds in dealing with the possibility of anti-competitive conduct, but conduct that was not required at all under the antitrust laws, that on opening of the markets to selling one's assets at a discount, to going into a business that the lawful monopolist was not already in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.930" offset="6127700">The additional point there is that the treble damage remedy is considerably more draconian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.475" offset="6161868">It acts in an ad hoc, specific case under the supervision of generalize...  generalist judges and ad hoc juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.156" offset="6192588">Whereas Congress decided that the scheme was most...  that was most appropriate...  the regime that was most appropriate to create this new world that this Court specifically recognized in the two previous Telecommunications Act cases was this regulatory regime, inhabited by experts, administered by experts, where there are prompt, efficient, effective remedies, and...  and a scheme which is adjustable from time to time to deal with any anti-competitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.141" offset="6304496">So it's not only a reason why Congress said we do not change the antitrust laws by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.572" offset="6334276">There's good reasons why Congress decided to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.967" offset="6343784">But there's also additional reasons why the section 2 remedy would be a sledge hammer in an area where Congress has enacted a scalpel to deal...</text>

            <text syncTime="2410.263" offset="9640960">I think it is common ground with my friends on the other side that a monopolist's right to refuse to deal with competitors is not an unqualified right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2421.243" offset="9684950">That's where the monopolist discriminates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.062" offset="9692160">They argue that's the only time a section 2 duty ought to be imposed because that...  in that situation you can be confident that it's anti-competitive conduct, and you won't have problems with dampening incentives and you won't have administrability problems because you can refer back to the prior course of dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.388" offset="9765512">But where they're wrong is in suggesting that that's the only time that you can find liability under section 2 for monopolist refusal to cooperate with its rivals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.693" offset="9802710">It is equally true in this case, in this situation where, as Justice Kennedy, your question earlier indicated, there is a regulatory regime in place that requires competitive access on the part of the monopolist in order to bring competition into the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.620" offset="9862478">And what you have...  and...  and I think these allegations are consistent that...  what I am about to say is consistent with the allegations in the complaint, and what you have is a course of conduct on the part of the monopolist that is intended to subvert the competitive entry that those regulations require.</text>

            <text syncTime="2497.011" offset="9987971">The...  the test, under the Sherman Act, for exclusionary conduct applies in the same way that...  it's the exact same test whether the '96 act is there or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.942" offset="10027677">The test is whether the conduct impairs rivals' opportunities to compete in the market and whether the...  the conduct does or does not further...  by the monopolist further competition on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.806" offset="10067174">That test would apply to a different factual scenario after the 1996 act was passed than before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.948" offset="10095700">And it's clear that that must be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.011" offset="10103954">For example, Your Honor, one thing that the 1996 act did...  this is section 253 of the act, which I think is at page 90 of the appendix to the petition...  it eliminated, preempted State monopoly franchises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.122" offset="10164454">Now, prior to passage of the 1996 act, if...  if Trinko went to sue...  bring a section 2 claim against a local telephone provider in a State where...  where there was a monopoly franchise law, Trinko would be out of court on the State action doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.128" offset="10232477">There would be an ironclad defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.531" offset="10238119">Well, section 253 of the act preempted the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.670" offset="10250658">So obviously in that situation, there is an antitrust claim that wasn't there before, and so it can't be the case that what...  that...  that the passage of the 1996 act has no relevance whatsoever to the application of section 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.253" offset="10320980">And indeed, we think it would impermissibly...  it would violate the savings clause and impermissibly modify the applicability of the antitrust laws to conclude that the 1996 act is the sole remedy here for a person in Trinko's position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2718.397" offset="10873522">The test is whether the monopolist's conduct prevents competition, obstructs competition, whether it does so on a basis other than competition on the merits, and whether it is...  there's otherwise a legitimate business justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.637" offset="10930469">That's the general rule, as the United States acknowledges at page 14 of its complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.562" offset="10970175">When one answers the first part of that test that...  which is does the monopolist's conduct obstruct competition, the...  the...  it's not the case that any violation of the 1996 act would obstruct competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.490" offset="11029943">What has to be shown there is that the monopolist's conduct is sufficiently grave, sufficiently serious, sufficiently sustained that it...  that it amounts to an overall pattern that obstructs competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.275" offset="11085009">So it's not the case that there is a...  that...  that there's a...  an automatic transference of a...  of a duty under the 1996 act into an antitrust duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.160" offset="11116565">But where the...  where the 1996 act becomes relevant is when you get to the next stage of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.172" offset="11136627">And I think...  and it's just what Your Honor said earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.218" offset="11144777">At that stage in the inquiry, it is...  the monopolist does not have open to it the argument that this is pro-competitive behavior and that I have a legitimate business justification for it because in that circumstance, it is unlawful to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.989" offset="11207889">And so it can't be a legitimate business justification to say I don't want to do something that the law compels me to do because I'll be better off as a competitive matter if I don't do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.493" offset="11525956">Because there's no way to know whether it's justified or not justified under the law without going into those details.</text>

            <text syncTime="2899.205" offset="11596800">And the main obstacle to your argument in my mind is it seems to be a question of whether that incredibly complex question will be answered by a regulatory agency in a regulatory proceeding brought by complainants or by 500 judges and juries in antitrust cases throughout the country, each potentially reaching a different answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.276" offset="13185045">And I think it's important, critically important, here to understand where the regulators are on that very question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.682" offset="13206674">The regulators don't think there's interference if there's mutual enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.480" offset="13221825">It's notable that the Federal Communications Commission is not on the brief for the United States and the Federal Trade Commission today and that's because their position, which is articulated in orders which we cite in the footnote page 38 of our brief, is that the duties that they impose, the...  the access duties and specific obligations, ought to be enforced under the antitrust laws as well as under the...  as well as under the Telecommunications Act and that...  and that...  you know, the lessons of history are behind that and the lessons of common sense are behind that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.858" offset="13327360">The fact is that the regulatory regime that the FCC tried to put in place to bring long distance competition and to bring telephone equipment competition was insufficient, standing on its own with all of those regulatory mechanisms, to make that competition occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.976" offset="13383889">That competition occurred only when vigorous antitrust enforcement was brought to bear in part to enforce those very regulatory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.406" offset="13413564">And that makes a great deal of common sense, of course, because the incumbents in this situation have every incentive in the world for this system not to work because they want to retain as many customers as they can and they want to make as much money as they can, and they have ample ability to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.184" offset="13472705">There's a thousand ways in which they could subvert this...  this regulatory regime by...  with...  with using low-level, low-intensity obstructionist conduct that history has shown is beyond the power of the regulators to...  to capture and prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.152" offset="13540519">And that is why antitrust law needs to apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.891" offset="13551491">It's why the FCC says it should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.610" offset="13558387">It's why the 15 States who have submitted a brief in support of our position on this said it should apply because that's the only way, operating in tandem, that we're going to get to the competition that Congress tried to bring about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.673" offset="13602691">And I submit to this Court that is exactly why the savings clause is in the 1996 act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.995" offset="13659951">The words competition, obstruction of competition, pro-competitive mask a fundamental distinction between the 1996 act and the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.884" offset="13707494">The '96 act creates competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.939" offset="13719719">Section 2 of the Sherman Act has always gone no further than protecting independently-developed competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.318" offset="13753260">The '96 act is a comprehensive regime for policing the thousand ways, as Mr. Verrilli said, in which the obligations to create competition might be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.859" offset="13807386">This complaint, if you look at the two paragraphs that Mr. Verrilli cited, paragraph 2 and paragraph 54, are all...  is all about helping to create competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.400" offset="13861512">Paragraph 2 says the conduct we complain of is that Verizon was making it difficult to obtain full use of Verizon's local loops.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.007" offset="13903935">There is no allegation of obstruction of AT&amp;T's independent efforts to create seller/ buyer transactions on its own without help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.070" offset="13948238">What we ask the Court to say on the merits here is not that there is a rigid requirement of discrimination or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.296" offset="13977182">What we ask the Court to recognize is that up till now...  till now...  helping hand cases have been limited by the requirement of discrimination between customers, not between self and others, but between customers, and there are compellingly strong reasons not to expand section 2 beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.215" offset="14064849">For institutional reasons, the antitrust courts are not capable of reliably making the necessary determinations and for fundamental incentive reasons, the incentives of incumbents to invest, the incentives of rivals to invest rather than piggy-back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.388" offset="14133499">In this context, a common law-like context, there's no question of overriding preexisting, settled antitrust obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.708" offset="14174772">The question is should the Court create something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.052" offset="14188147">And in a common law-like area, the existence of another regime is one strong reason not to create something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.051" offset="14224196">The Court said so in the Black &amp; Decker case only last term involving the common law of ERISA obligations when the Court said the scope of permissible judicial innovation is narrower where other Federal actors are engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.950" offset="14283755">That's what we ask the Court to decide, that the 1996 act is one compellingly good reason not to create new section 2 law here.</text>
