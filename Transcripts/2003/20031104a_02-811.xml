            <text syncTime="3360.746" offset="13442926">Your Honor, on the qualified immunity point, there is plain language in the Constitution as to what the Fourth Amendment says, but this Court said in Anderson v. Creighton, that is not the correct approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.891" offset="13487543">It's not at the level of what the Constitution says in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.863" offset="13499350">It's how it's applied in particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.547" offset="13510113">And here, the Ninth Circuit did move the law in specific respects, and this Court is being asked to move the law and to answer questions that we either open, and in fact are controverted in the lower courts as we speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.231" offset="13556924">Sheppard had established that you can go beyond the four corners of the page of the warrant to look at supporting materials when there's any kind of suitable words of reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.255" offset="13589002">The Ninth Circuit itself has clarified since this case, in U.S. v. Vesikuru, 314 F. 3d 1116, suitable words of reference can be that we're relying on the sworn complaint to supply probable cause, very similar, in fact indistinguishable, from the words of reference in this warrant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.692" offset="13662668">You're being asked to retreat from Sheppard and to clarify when a warrant can or cannot incorporate accompanying affidavit materials and that's a question you're being asked to answer in this case and then apply against this officer retrospectively to give damages and deny qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.039" offset="13728078">That's inappropriate under this Court's settled case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.268" offset="13737064">Second, you're being asked in this case to say specifically an officer has a constitutional duty to proofread and re-check a warrant after it has been issued by the magistrate, which this Court has never held, and this Court has said in prior cases, including Illinois v. Gates, that the officers' sole duty once they apply for an order of authority is to execute the warrant faithfully in accordance with the constraints imposed upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.417" offset="13833613">McGrew moved the law in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.979" offset="13843853">It was decided 6 months after this search occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.951" offset="13855765">This decision below in this Ramirez case moved the law further, and yet the Court is being asked to deny qualified immunity to this officer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.413" offset="13889620">As for the Leon dictum, Justice Kennedy, you asked, we believe that if in fact Agent Groh had noticed this error, if anyone had called it to his attention during proceeding to execute the search, the more reasonable course of conduct would be to stop and seek clarification from the court, as the officers did in Maryland v. Garrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.565" offset="13966211">Having not noticed the error, having gone ahead and executed the warrant in good faith, having executed the search in compliance with the request made to the court, that is good faith and--</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.367" offset="14069447">But here, the officer had not noticed the error, the magistrate had not noticed the error, no one on the team had noticed the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.856" offset="14091389">The next day, a lawyer sitting in his office reading the page in the cold light of day noticed the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.800" offset="14115109">Immediately Agent Groh responded, faxed him the face page of the application.</text>
