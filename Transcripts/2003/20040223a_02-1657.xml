            <text syncTime="25.429" offset="101669">The court remains in session.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.915" offset="107624">Mr. Wolfman.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="brian_wolfman" startTime="62.415" stopTime="192.780">
            <label>Mr. Brian Wolfman</label>
            <text syncTime="62.415" offset="249626">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.213" offset="264777">In 1999, Randall Scarborough won his disability appeal before the Veterans Court on the ground that the Government's position constituted clear and unmistakable error and that that position was, quote, not reasonably debatable.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.560" offset="330188">End quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.097" offset="332382">He then immediately filed a fee application under the Equal Access to Justice Act that contained three of the elements called for by the act, but it did not initially allege that the Government's position lacked substantial justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.421" offset="389642">The Government seized on that alleged omission and without any mention of this Court's path-marking decision in Irwin v. Veterans Affairs, both it and the Federal Circuit determined that this omission of this legal conclusion was jurisdictional, meaning in effect that Mr. Scarborough's amendment to the application could not relate back to his timely filed application.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.792" offset="499148">The Federal Circuit and the Government persisted in this view even after this Court remanded in light of Edelman v. Lynchburg College, which embraced the relation-back doctrine both in a judicial and an administrative law context.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.003" offset="568007">The Federal Circuit's fundamental error here, the basic mistake, is that it perceived EAJA's limitations period as jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.745" offset="606877">As I said, that holding can't be squared with the decision in Irwin or as reiterated by this Court just two terms ago in Franconia Associates, and that principle is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.430" offset="653688">Unless Congress has provided otherwise, limitations periods that run in favor of the Government like those involving private parties are not jurisdictional, but rather are subject to ordinary statute of limitations principles that provide exceptions under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.613" offset="734354">And so then the question is, what does EAJA say to this?</text>
            <text syncTime="187.950" offset="751700">There's nothing in EAJA that even hints that the statute creates the absolute--</text>

            <text syncTime="194.688" offset="778658">That's the acronym, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.207" offset="784823">There... there's nothing that even hints that the Court... that the Congress created that type of absolute time bar under EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.064" offset="828186">In fact, quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.467" offset="833829">The statute makes clear that a court entertaining an EAJA application already has jurisdiction over the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.435" offset="865698">Simply put, EAJA can't be jurisdictional in that sense, absolute in that sense, because as this Court just reiterated in Kontrick v. Ryan, EAJA doesn't serve to place a class of cases within a court's adjudicative authority.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="234.185" offset="936647">Mr. Wolfman, if you're right about that it's not jurisdictional, so there should be equitable tolling, why should there be equitable... what's equitable about allowing a lawyer to overcome his carelessness?</text>
            <text syncTime="250.243" offset="1000908">I mean, the... the case of a layperson not getting a verification is one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.447" offset="1037688">A lawyer reads a statute, it says, do this, that, and the other, and he doesn't do the other, and then it says, oh, but be equitable, court.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.507" offset="1066005">Why should a lawyer's carelessness be an occasion for equitable tolling?</text>
            <text syncTime="273.111" offset="1092441">Is there anything in it for the client if this is just the lawyer's fee?</text>

            <label>Mr. Brian Wolfman</label>
            <text syncTime="278.479" offset="1113861">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.056" offset="1116160">Well, I think there are several answers to that, but let me take the last part first, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.393" offset="1133505">First is that here actually the... the client has much coming.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.087" offset="1156284">These are the client's fees, and the veterans statutes provide that the contingent fee, which cannot exceed 20 percent, would be reduced dollar for dollar by the EAJA recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.854" offset="1203409">So the client here, as all veterans claims, do have money at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.145" offset="1220545">Let me turn to the question of equitable tolling that you asked.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.137" offset="1260460">The... the statute... the... the veterans statutes provide that the lawyer can enter a contingency arrangement with the client, but that the fee can't... can't exceed 20 percent of the claimant's back benefits if he or she prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.616" offset="1330364">But when--</text>

            <label>Mr. Brian Wolfman</label>
            <text syncTime="336.109" offset="1344366">--That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.390" offset="1349486">So there... there can be no fee taken unless there's victory.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.022" offset="1364010">The statute also provides that.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.841" offset="1371324">However, a... a statute also provides on what do we do about the interaction between EAJA and this statutory contingency fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.244" offset="1412911">And what it provides is that for the same work, if there is an EAJA recovery, the client must benefit by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.410" offset="1449587">There can't be a double recovery and that the contingent fee would be reduced dollar for dollar for the EAJA recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.983" offset="1507892">So... so then we're back to where Justice Ginsburg's question was.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.395" offset="1517505">You say, really, the person who should suffer is the lawyer, if the lawyer is negligent, not the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.142" offset="1536522">That would be pretty easy to arrange.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.188" offset="1544673">And you really want a rule that says whenever the lawyer is negligent, well, the other side has to suffer the consequence rather than the lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.586" offset="1606322">Why couldn't you just say... I mean, if I were sitting in that court, it wouldn't take me long to try to figure that out unless Congress thought of... unless it forbid it somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.215" offset="1640803">I mean, if it forbid it, you couldn't do it, but... but I don't know... what you've read me doesn't sound as if it forbids it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.501" offset="12977946">I think it might be more accurate to say it's a sovereign immunity-based limitation, but that carries with it the very same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.681" offset="13006681">Namely, it needs to be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.705" offset="13014727">Courts have no power to expand it beyond what its normal confines would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.330" offset="13033221">So the term jurisdictional is just a label.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.135" offset="13044506">What's important is the substance of conditions on sovereign immunity, and that is they need to be strictly construed and cannot be enlarged beyond what Congress has provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.338" offset="13189329">I'd also point out to Justice Frankfurter's statement in Holmberg v. Armbrecht where he said that when Congress sets a statute of limitation, there is the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.029" offset="13232065">The statute of limitation that Congress set is definitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3316.286" offset="13265084">That's true, but again, I'm not sure a real distinction can be made there because, as I said before, when we look at what is a fee application, we define a fee application by those things that Congress said are defined as content.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.143" offset="13308552">Ultimately I think the important point here is that strict adherence to these types of statutory rules is the best guarantee of fairness in these cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brian Wolfman</label>
            <text syncTime="3401.620" offset="13606452">I'd like to go immediately to Justice Kennedy's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.308" offset="13633202">He asked about the best case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.249" offset="13640934">Well, the case that the Government relies on principally in its brief is Soriano v. the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.450" offset="13661727">The problem with that case is it was overruled by Irwin, and the problem here is that the principle we're now operating on, the problem with the Government, is that when we talk about statutes of limitations principles, you apply the same principles that apply among private parties unless Congress explicitly provides otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.338" offset="13745319">Now, I did want to, if I might, turn to the relation-back doctrine just briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.737" offset="13770919">And the... the question arose in Mr. Minear's presentation, well, this case doesn't involve rule 15(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.282" offset="13805087">But either did Edelman v. Lynchburg College.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.543" offset="13818149">Edelman is best read as a case that applied the common law doctrine of relation-back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.487" offset="13841868">The Court held, regardless of the EEOC's regulation, even if we were interpreting the statute from scratch, we would apply the relation doctrine back here because it has a common law pedigree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.091" offset="13904353">And that's all we're asking for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.487" offset="13913861">The other principal submission by Mr. Minear is the efficiency argument, that these matters have to be done promptly and efficiently and there's thousands of suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.011" offset="13955971">I have two basic answers to that, the general and the specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.976" offset="13971853">The general is that the... until the Federal Circuit ruled, this was the rule, the rule that we're asking for, in all of the circuits that had ruled on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.402" offset="14009574">And the Government does not present an iota of evidence there were any problems in applying the relation-back principle in those circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.196" offset="14044682">It's the Third, the Sixth, and the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.881" offset="14055445">The specific answer is I think we know what would have happened in this case if my client's amendment had related back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.069" offset="14092225">The matter would have been resolved 3 or 4 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.527" offset="14110093">There is no serious efficiency concern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.736" offset="14126916">The reason we're here much later is both because the Government interposed this jurisdictional defense and it asked for seven or eight extensions of time during the course of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.336" offset="14173309">The final thing I would like to say is that the Government's arguments presuppose that there's no good reason for relaxing rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.707" offset="14210821">But there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.533" offset="14214060">We realize that litigants and lawyers make mistakes and rules such as relation-back serve important purposes so that litigants and lawyers don't get tripped up by technical rules such as the one the court... the court below and the Government is trying to impose here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.564" offset="14290233">If the Court has no questions.</text>
