            <text syncTime="54.696" offset="218697">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.720" offset="226847">This case presents three issues, two arising from purposeful and recurring misconduct by the trial prosecutors, and a third from constitutionally deficient defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.442" offset="273763">Prior to trial, the prosecutors promised to disclose discoverable material to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.296" offset="301140">They knew that Robert Farr would testify as a key witness at each phase of trial, and they knew that he was an informant and had been paid for his services.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.296" offset="337084">Mr. Farr did in fact take the stand at both phases of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.383" offset="353489">He denied he was an informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.528" offset="362057">He denied he received any consideration for his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.986" offset="379925">He denied tipping off the authorities that Mr. Banks would be taking a trip to Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.899" offset="399569">He denied setting up Mr. Banks for arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.880" offset="415451">The prosecutors knew that when Mr. Farr gave his testimony it was not truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.996" offset="439902">They did not rise to their feet and ask Mr. Farr to correct this testimony.</text>

            <label>Mr. George H. Kendall</label>
            <text syncTime="121.203" offset="484728">We have asked this Court to affirm the district court, who... who did grant relief on death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.322" offset="505208">We're not asking for relief on guilt innocence on... on the Mr. Farr claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.204" offset="520777">I'm... I'm... I'm somewhat puzzled by that, but you have three different claims to discuss here and I don't want to take too long.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.641" offset="546482">It... it would seem to me that, if it... if... if this is the evidence at trial, that... that there's no additional obligation or special obligation at sentencing where that becomes really a secondary matter.</text>

            <label>Mr. George H. Kendall</label>
            <text syncTime="151.009" offset="603951">Your Honor, the reason why we take that position is that his testimony at the punishment phase is absolutely critical for the state to get the death penalty in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.932" offset="635716">The district court recognized that.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.790" offset="643135">The Fifth Circuit in this case said that that testimony was crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.505" offset="657972">What he told the jury was that Mr. Banks had returned to Dallas to get a gun so that Mr. Banks could on the return trip commit armed robberies and take care of and eliminate witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.136" offset="708441">There was no other testimony that came close to matching that at the punishment phase, and the state had the burden to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Banks would be a danger in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.160" offset="752640">If they didn't satisfy that--</text>

            <text syncTime="197.242" offset="788898">And as I understand it, you... you assert that... that he would not... a jury would not have judged him as harshly if the jury had known that he was going to get the gun in order that Farr could commit robberies with... with apparently his assistance, rather than what Farr had told them, namely that he had gotten the gun in order that he would commit future robberies, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="234.311" offset="937169">And you think that would have made the difference, whether he's getting the gun to let somebody else kill or getting the gun to kill himself?</text>

            <text syncTime="266.062" offset="1064229">The point is... is that the... the state could not ask the jury to impose the death sentence unless it first found beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.... there was a strong likelihood that Mr. Banks would commit acts of violence in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.784" offset="1111040">We think there's a clear difference, and the trial prosecutors recognized this, between Mr. Banks going to get a gun so that Mr. Banks could rob and kill, as opposed to providing instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.096" offset="1156284">But more importantly, Your Honor, Mr. Farr recanted that testimony at the Federal hearing and that recantation was found credible by the district court.</text>
