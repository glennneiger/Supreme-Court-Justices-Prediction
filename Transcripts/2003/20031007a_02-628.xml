            <text syncTime="5.451" offset="21734">Sovereign immunity should not bar enforcement of the consent decree in this case for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.486" offset="41900">First, when State officials ask a district court to enter a consent decree, they submit their rights concerning the decree for judicial determination, thereby waiving any possible claim for objection on the basis of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.718" offset="102818">Second, the decree in this case provides prospective relief to protect the supremacy of Federal law, exactly as envisioned by Ex Parte Young.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.572" offset="578247">You have the second ground, which is just if you have authority to enter the decree, you have authority to enforce the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.683" offset="602697">Now, for purpose of that argument, does it make any difference to you whether the State Attorney General is there or whether these officials have the power to represent the State?</text>

            <text syncTime="960.093" offset="3840313">Enforcement of the decree in this case does not violate the Eleventh Amendment for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.581" offset="3862256">First, any Eleventh Amendment objection was waived, and second, enforcement is permissible under Ex Parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.300" offset="3893185">Now, the waiver issue arises in this case because the State officials are arguing that the relief in the consent decree that is directed to them violates the Eleventh Amendment, and it is that Eleventh Amendment objection that those same officials, together with the Attorney General, waived when they asked the district court to enter the very relief that they are now objecting to on Eleventh Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.081" offset="4004258">And the reason that there is waiver is that under this Court's cases, when the Attorney General on the... of the State on behalf of the State invokes a Federal court's jurisdiction, Eleventh Amendment immunity is waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.564" offset="4066220">Now, when the Attorney General in this case entered into a consent decree on behalf of State officials in their official capacity and then asked the district court to enter that decree, he clearly invoked that court's jurisdiction and waived any Eleventh Amendment objection to the entry of that judgment against those State officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.449" offset="4541753">They are acting ultra vires when they're... when they're violating Federal law, and therefore, you're not impinging upon the State's sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.616" offset="4578429">But now with the theory that you're expounding, you're not only holding them to compliance with Federal law, but you're saying even when you're not acting ultra vires, when you have a lot of perfectly legal options of how to comply with Federal law, you will... you will choose this option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.313" offset="4653244">And that... that is, it seems to me, impinging upon State sovereign immunity in... in a way that... that the mere theory of Ex Parte Young does not justify.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.333" offset="12889234">A suit is brought against a... a secretary of health and human services in the State who absolutely wants to do these wonderful things for pediatric care that are not required by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.708" offset="12942733">And if the State Attorney General were not in the situation, I am very reluctant to think that this official can go in and say, yes, require me to do these wonderful things that State law does not require, that Federal law does not require, but that I would like to do, signs the consent decree, and then we're stuck.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.880" offset="13047432">It was a prior Attorney General, a prior head of the health department, and those prior officers under petitioners' theory had bargained away the legislature's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.592" offset="13082331">It's clear the legislature couldn't pass a statute that said, we're going to allow the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Texas to run our Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.259" offset="13117022">That would be a fundamental violation of federalism and separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.686" offset="13130710">Nor could the Attorney General sign a contract to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.742" offset="13142936">Therefore, they should not be able to sign a consent decree to do that unless it is necessitated by an ongoing violation of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.203" offset="13176790">It is only the Supremacy Clause that justifies that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.259" offset="13189016">In addition, this course's voluntary... this Court's voluntary invocation of Federal jurisdiction cases have, by and large, not been Ex Parte Young cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.001" offset="13227990">In Lapides, in Gardner, in Clark, they were suits against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.127" offset="13244500">They were not Ex Parte Young cases, and this Court would be breaking new ground by saying an Ex Parte Young defendant who, under the legal fiction, is not the State, is simultaneously the State for purpose of being able to waive sovereign immunity by litigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.442" offset="13305731">And as was pointed out in the earlier colloquy, the State was a defendant, raised the Eleventh Amendment, was dismissed on Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.525" offset="13342093">And to say now that ambiguous and conflicting provisions of the consent decree, signed by the State officials as Ex Parte Young defendants, can waive the sovereign immunity is to extend the Ex Parte Young fiction beyond--</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.660" offset="13550550">The district court, before enforcing the consent decree, found violations of... ongoing violations of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.627" offset="13582420">That finding is found at pages... at the bottom of page 272 and 273 in the appendix to the cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.635" offset="13614498">And it... it refers and relies on the Court's earlier extensive findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.208" offset="13636754">Second, there has been no contested motion to modify filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.152" offset="13660578">There was no contested motion to modify pending before the district court or pending before the court of appeals, and this is an important matter for this Court to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.780" offset="13695060">Of course, a motion to modify would allow State officials to present legitimate concerns, if they have any, concerning the consent decree to the district court so that the district... with them having the burden of proof, so that they could have their best shot to show the district court what's wrong with the consent decree under this Court's decision in Rufo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.266" offset="13773009">That... that burden of proof gives the district court a full record to base its decision on about whether or not to modify the decree and it also creates an adequate record for appellate review of those questions, which is not present at the moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.361" offset="14017411">As has been pointed out, Rufo does create a more flexible standard for modification when consent decrees are involved in institutional reform litigation of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.417" offset="14065580">That flexibility, though, does not sink down to the level of mere inconvenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.854" offset="14091389">So just because it becomes inconvenient for a successor administration to comply with the consent decree is not justification for modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.906" offset="14123572">But if the... the new State officials can bring legitimate concerns to the district court's attention, modification may be appropriate.</text>
