            <text syncTime="327.359" offset="1309362">Well, the point I was making was that the court ruled against us because they said that the partnership taxes had not been assessed directly against the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.997" offset="1355964">But respondents now correctly concede that there is no requirement of Federal law that a derivative or secondary State law liability to pay a tax has to be assessed before it can be collected, and that concession is plainly correct in light of this Court's decision in 1933 in the Leighton case where the Court held that a derivative or secondary liability that arises under State law to pay a tax may be recovered... and I quote... without assessment of that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.937" offset="1471739">And there are numerous cases that have applied that principle in... in related secondary and derivative liability contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.846" offset="1499324">And as... as I've already indicated, those principles plainly apply here because under the Uniform Partnership Act, which applies in California, the liability of the partner is derivative for the... and secondary rather than principal, as I've discussed with Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.805" offset="1563167">Not only is it clear from the legal structure of the UPA, but the official comments to the... of... to that act state that the liability of the partnership for partnership debts is principal and that the liability of partners is... is in the nature of a guarantor.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.009" offset="1635997">It's secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.564" offset="1638191">It arises only when the partnership doesn't pay its own debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.724" offset="1650834">Federal law also makes clear that this is a liability that attaches directly to the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.206" offset="1676748">This is a Federal employment tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.981" offset="1683853">It applies to employers because, under California law, the... the partnership is a separate and distinct legal entity.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.508" offset="1818018">I'm just being finicky I guess, because to me we... the Court in Commissioner v. Stern said that these... historically these are substantive liabilities that Congress accepts from State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.851" offset="1867337">And therefore, the Court applies the substantive body of State rules in... in implementing that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.084" offset="1892310">You could also think of this... and I'm not asking the Court to reconsider Commissioner v. Stern.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.625" offset="1910491">But you can... even in light of Commissioner v. Stern, you can think of this as Federal law borrowing State law for this remedial purpose, and Congress has sanctioned that by not altering the principles that have long existed on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.750" offset="1962945">The... but the... the point that this Court made in Leighton is that these principles that they apply come from State law and you don't a... actually respondents now admit there's no mechanism in Federal law to assist this... assess this sort of secondary derivative State law liability, and that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.211" offset="2032744">That's what the Court addressed in the Leighton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.978" offset="2043820">And the court of appeals in this case just misapplied those well-accepted principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.491" offset="2073913">Once the assessment of the partnership taxes was made, under section 6502 the United States has 10 years from the date of the assessment to bring any proceeding in court to collect the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.579" offset="2126263">And in the Updike case in 1930, the Court held that that 10 years applies not only to actions against the directly liable party but also to a person whose liability is derivative or secondary and arises from State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.446" offset="2181747">And the Court explained that the broad purpose and broad text of 6502 applies equally in both cases because in the Court's words, in a real sense the action against the derivatively liable party is a proceeding in court to collect the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.217" offset="2244859">As the Court said in Updike, the aim in the one case, as in the other, is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.675" offset="2262622">It's to collect the tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.283" offset="2269100">Now, in this Court respondents do not dispute that accepted understanding of 6502.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.765" offset="2295014">Instead, they raise here a new and, indeed, a radical claim that no court has adopted and that they did not raise prior to their merits brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.865" offset="2331376">What they argue now for the first time is that the Federal statute of limitations should not govern this derivative liability claim because since it stems from substantive State law, the State statute of limitations should govern it.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.261" offset="2384980">Now, since they didn't raise that claim at any time before their merits brief in this Court... and it is a statute of limitations which is an affirmative defense... they're... they've waived the claim as too rate to... too late to raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.416" offset="2433567">But nonetheless, I think it is important to note that their claim is plainly inconsistent with this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.799" offset="2459167">For example, in the Summerlin case, this Court held that whenever the United States acquires a claim acting in its governmental capacity, that claim of the United States is not subject to a State statute of limitations because of the sovereign rights... sovereign immunity of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.979" offset="2523847">And they applied that holding in Summerlin to a situation where what the United States obtained was a right to enforce a private note and private mortgage that the--</text>

            <text syncTime="681.134" offset="2724467">And so whether you think of it as extinguishing the claim or limiting the... the period of recovery, in either event what's instrumental is that the... the United States had the right at the time it obtained the claim and that the State law could not thereafter cut that right off.</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.735" offset="4750838">That liability didn't have a... a common law precedent, and so Congress created the liability because they saw a specific problem where lenders were allowing or in... in effect, helping employers evade employment taxes by loaning them money from which they paid wages but didn't pay taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.245" offset="4836937">And so Congress created this separate statutory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.567" offset="4894198">And so as the Court held in... in Leighton, we can proceed without assessment against them to enforce that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.286" offset="4925127">Now, I do want to also mention the... the citations that respondents make to section 6303.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.914" offset="4959608">That section appears in the portion of the code that addresses administrative collection through liens and levies, and it states that the Secretary is to give notice of the assessment to any person liable for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.122" offset="5012480">The cases that have interpreted and applied that statute, which stem from 1954, have... have concluded correctly that that statute applies only to administrative collection through liens and levies and has no application to judicial collection actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.834" offset="5083324">And there's a... a sound historical explanation for that, and that is that prior to 1954, there were two independent routes for collecting taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.409" offset="5121567">The Secretary was authorized by the code to bring a judicial collection suit, but there was a separate officer known as the collector of revenue for each district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.357" offset="5161378">And the collector of revenue was, by the code, authorized to do the administrative collection through liens and levies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.756" offset="5186978">And the predecessor of 6303 had said that the collector is to give notice of the assessment and make demands for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.179" offset="5220624">And it was well established that that applied to his actions in administrative collection and had no application of the Secretary's independent authority to bring a judicial collection suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.332" offset="5261270">In 1954 in revising the code, Congress eliminated references to the collector in the code, placed the Secretary in charge both of the... of judicial and administrative enforcement and changed the predecessor language of 6303 from saying the collector is to give notice to saying the Secretary is to give notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.682" offset="5342668">But in doing so, Congress did not mean to change... and the courts that have reviewed this have correctly concluded did not change... the fact that this notice of assessment requirement applies only to the administrative collection area, has no application to judicial collection suits like this one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.135" offset="5668467">And then as I said, although... the... the cases are also perfectly consistent that the notice to the partnership is valid as constructive notice to the partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.621" offset="5710472">And so, for example, if we have a partnership employment tax liability from Smith Construction and the two partners are Bob Jones and Bill Wilson, notice of the assessment to the partnership is valid as notice to its two partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.340" offset="5777345">And so our lien arises, if they don't pay the tax, but if a third party creditor is out there, First National Bank, the First... our notice to the partnership may not be notice to the First National Bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.126" offset="7028402">What the Government in this case does is it relies specifically upon historical cases that stem from old section 280, which is adopted as section 6901 of the Internal Revenue Code, whereby assessments may be made against transferees, donees, and fiduciaries, and the cases interpreting those statutes basically find that there is a derivative liability with a coterminous statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.654" offset="11906612">Interest and penalties, such as have accrued in this case, would not accrue because the partners would be encouraged at every point and at every spot to cause their partnership to pay or to pay the tax themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="3267.786" offset="13071047">At page 3 of respondents' brief on the merits, they say... and I quote... if respondents are secondarily liable for the partnership taxes, then the Ninth Circuit's ruling that the IRS must assess respondents to collect the partnership taxes is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.703" offset="13142727">It is clear to us that there is... this is a secondary derivative liability that partners have under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.907" offset="13179611">I didn't hear respondents give any explanation of why that isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.283" offset="13197061">Given those two facts, then this Court's holding in Leighton seems clearly applicable, which is that we don't have to assess a derivative State law liability to bring suit to recover upon that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.907" offset="13251605">Now, respondents say, well, somehow that holding is influenced by the fact that transferee liability is provided in 6901 of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.112" offset="13288385">It's interesting that in... in the Leighton case what the Court held was that the 6901 transferee liability is a supplementary remedy that did not displace and, indeed, left in place the right of the United States to bring its suit upon the derivative State law liability without assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.410" offset="13373544">So the... the principle that we draw from the Leighton case is not dependent on any of the specific statutes that address specific types of... of assignments of transferees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.414" offset="13425580">In fact, it's utterly independent of that, which was the very issue the Court decided in Leighton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.493" offset="13445956">Given that and... and given that there's a derivative sub-secondary liability, we can recover against State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.417" offset="13477616">Then the only other question is, well, what statute of limitations applies to that, which the Court held in Updike that it's 6502 which applies both to the direct liability and the derivative liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.191" offset="13556715">C, it may not make any difference because the State and Federal may give you enough time anyway.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="3401.162" offset="13604571">The reason it should be Federal is because all of these actions are designed, as the Court stressed in Updike, to collect the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.933" offset="13631634">We have different remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.586" offset="13638322">Congress could Federalize all of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.565" offset="13646158">Congress could write a statute that said, you know, you can bring suits for derivative liabilities and that those suits will... specifically subject to 6502.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.596" offset="13686282">And what the Court noted in Stern was that Congress hasn't done that because the Court has consistently applied State law to permit such tax collection to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.394" offset="13737482">And... and so that's why Updike has got to be right because this is a strong Federal interest in collecting taxes, not to be too big about it, but I mean, this Court has noted that the collection of taxes is the lifeblood of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.800" offset="13795161">This is as sovereign a claim as we have, and... and because of that, we need to have a uniform statute of limitations, which Congress has provided under 6502.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.748" offset="13834971">If... if we were left to the haphazards of State law, we would certainly want Congress to... to address that and correct it, but they don't need to correct it because since 1930 in the Updike case, the Court has explained that 6502 is broad enough to cover both types of... of judicial collection proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.060" offset="13916160">In the Court's words, the action against derivatively liable party is in every real sense a proceeding in court to collect the tax, and that's the... that's the statutory language.</text>
