            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="8.339" offset="33332">This case begins with a prosecution and conviction for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.564" offset="50155">The defendant at the time of the incident was about 17-and-a-half years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.018" offset="68023">He and an accomplice, another young man by the name of Soto, attempted to take a truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.228" offset="92891">Carjacking or truck-jacking was the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.593" offset="106371">They attempted to take it from a driver in the shopping mall, and in the course of the attempted theft, Soto shot and killed the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.379" offset="133433">About a month after the incident, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department detective interviewed Alvarado at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.240" offset="160914">Alvarado was brought to the police station by his parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.791" offset="171154">They remained there, although outside the interview room.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.721" offset="182857">The interview lasted for about two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.053" offset="192157">During the interview, Alvarado confessed to his participation in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.216" offset="212846">He then left the interview with his parents after it was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.583" offset="222250">Weeks later, Alvarado was arrested and his statement was used against him at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.133" offset="244506">The problem, as Alvarado sees it, is that he was not given his Miranda warnings during the interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.907" offset="271569">The State claims that Miranda warning was not needed because Alvarado was not in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.496" offset="293930">The California Courts agreed with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.713" offset="302811">They found that Alvarado was not in custody so that the statement was properly admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.016" offset="320052">No ran relating was required and the statement was admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.269" offset="333009">The conviction was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.448" offset="341786">The case then went to the federal system where Alvarado sought a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.897" offset="359549">At this point, the case becomes more complicated that a mere discussion of whether the defendant was in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.606" offset="386403">In habeas cases, Federal Courts are controlled by the provisions of the federal statute, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act known as AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.746" offset="426945">Under AEDPA, a Federal Court can set aside a State Court determination only if the State Court’s determination was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established in federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.664" offset="486609">In the habeas proceeding, the United States District Court applied this standard and found that the California determination, that Alvarado was not in custody, was not an unreasonable application of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.428" offset="529659">But the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.097" offset="544287">We now hold that the Court of Appeals determination was not consistent with the review standard finding in the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.190" offset="572709">It can be said that fair-minded jurors could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.731" offset="598831">And the opinion sets forth arguments that could be made on one side or the other of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.765" offset="618998">The problem, as we have said, is that Federal Courts on habeas cannot undertake this determination as a de novo matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.082" offset="644284">The State Court’s decision fits within the matrix of our prior decisions and does not reflect and unreasonable application of clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.025" offset="676049">In this case, the Court of Appeals put great weight on the fact that Alvarado was under 18 years of age and that he had no substantial previous experience with the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.373" offset="733414">These factors that set were significant and concluding that he was in fact in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.176" offset="756611">We have a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.820" offset="763193">The State’s failure to consider Alvarado’s age and inexperience did not provide a basis for concluding that the State Court’s decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.538" offset="802064">As the opinion for the Court today notes, our cases applying the Miranda custody test have not mentioned the suspect’s age, much less mandated its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.882" offset="847517">The Court of Appeals ignored the argument that the custody inquiry states an objective rule designed to give clear guidance to the police and that age and inexperience are subjective factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.513" offset="881998">For these reasons, the State Court’s failure to consider Alvarado’s age does not provide a proper basis for finding that the State Court’s decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.517" offset="925989">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.466" offset="937796">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion, he is joined in that opinion by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg.</text>
