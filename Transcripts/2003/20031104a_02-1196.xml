            <text syncTime="82.942" offset="476514">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="86.519" offset="490829">Over 10,000 persons in 38 States invested $300 million in respondent's payphone business on the expectation that their investments would yield a 14 percent return due to respondent's experience, efficiency, and management expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.817" offset="575988">The decision below that these transactions were not investment contracts merely because they specified a fixed return to the investor, rather than an unspecified portion of the enterprise's profits, can not be squared with the language, history, and purpose of the Securities Acts, 70 years of consistent SEC interpretation and enforcement, and this Court's jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.025" offset="700854">The congressional definition of security, as this Court has repeatedly said, is broad and flexible, and intended to be all-inclusive to cover the countless and variable schemes devised by those who would seek money from others on the promise of a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.087" offset="781102">Congress intended, in the words of this Court, to encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment, and the term investment contract, this Court has held, was intended to be a broad catch-all.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.601" offset="847139">Therefore, substance, not form or title, governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.635" offset="867201">These terms, investment contract, are to be construed broadly to embrace...  again, in the words of this Court...  all forms of investment schemes that bear a resemblance to what is commonly understood to be a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.610" offset="931149">And this Court has said, because promoters are so creative, these terms must be flexible and inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.867" offset="964168">A catch-all must catch all.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.432" offset="978483">It is irrational to conclude that Congress would have defined security...</text>

            <text syncTime="212.874" offset="996246">Mr. Solicitor General, may I jump ahead for a second?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.641" offset="1007322">Is the...  is your adversary correct in saying that as far as decided cases are concerned, not the position of the SEC, but there is no judicial decision holding that a...  an instrument that provides a fixed return is an investment contract?</text>

            <text syncTime="232.072" offset="1073046">Well, Justice Stevens, I can answer this by saying that the seminal case, Howey, referred to and cited Blue Sky cases and Federal court of appeals decisions, which did contain those type of instruments, fixed return instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.706" offset="1139502">This specific question has not previously been decided by this Court, but the Court has never decided, and the cases that the Court referred to in Howey did not ever say that...  that the fixed return instrument was excluded from the term investment contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.823" offset="1268024">The Court has never said...</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="282.226" offset="1273562">But the United Housing case did refer...  suggest that the requirement that the income come from profits, did it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gen Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="289.080" offset="1301043">Well, the...  the references to the...  to the...  this...  from this...  our perspective, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the return must be examined from the standpoint of the investor, the invest...  and the Court...  I don't think the Court intended to restrict in that case, and the language is not reasonably susceptible in my judgement to the...  to the understanding that that was intended to exclude investments or instruments that provided a fixed return.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.832" offset="1424028">What the Court has repeatedly referred to is the...  from the standpoint of the investor, what the investor is expecting to do is to put his or her money to work for him or her, that is to say, put that money into an enterprise of some sort so the investor can sit back and watch the returns come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.009" offset="1508769">The investor doesn't care whether that's a fixed return or a speculative return.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.150" offset="1537295">In fact, the definition in both the 33 and the 34 Act includes types of investments, such as common stock, that have speculative returns built into their definition, so to speak, fixed returns instruments, such as bonds, preferred stock, indentures, and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.378" offset="1618170">Then the term, as this Court has repeatedly said, those terms are relatively fixed and understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.322" offset="1641993">But because Congress wanted to embrace, because this is a remedial statute intended to protect the investing public and the integrity of the marketplace so that people will feel secure in investing their resources in other instruments that promoters are offering...</text>

            <text syncTime="393.270" offset="1717748">General Olson, you...  you put the stress on investment and that seems right with the statute refers to investment contracts, but there are surely debt instruments that would not be investment contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.345" offset="1782114">So what is the dividing line between something that constitutes a plain old debt that is not an investment contract and not a security, and one that is?</text>
            <text syncTime="422.165" offset="1833419">I mean, how do we identify something as an investment contract rather...  rather than an ordinary debt?</text>

            <text syncTime="429.596" offset="1863094">Well, I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that many of those instruments that are ordinary debt instruments may be investment contracts as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.429" offset="1934460">Well, what this Court has said is that when a person puts their money into a common enterprise with the expectation...  expectation of a return, that is...  through the...  as a result of the efforts of others, that is an investment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.230" offset="2001647">Now, many notes, or many types of offerings, might be based upon a fixed return and might appear in the...  to look like notes or fixed return types of investments and still be investment contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.862" offset="2088165">I...  I would think most creditors who extend credit rely on the investment skill or the financial responsibility of...  of the lender.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.193" offset="11485455">In fact, in the brief, the SEC says the amount ultimately credited to the contributor's account, the amount itself being dependent upon the degree of success attending the venture...  and I'm reading from pages 39 and 40 and footnote 10...  with respect to the Abbett, Sommer case, which is a 19...  I believe 62 decision...  by the SEC, the SEC admitted in Abbett, Sommer that it wasn't looking at traditional profits analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.393" offset="11614290">That was a mortgage loan servicing case and they said that what was being offered there was not just the repayment on the notes but also the services, and they found that the reduction of risk in that case was the...  basically the profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.719" offset="11687538">So they departed from what is a normal profit analysis and that's freely admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.292" offset="11709899">In the interpretative release they've issued, the multi-level release under the 33 Act, number 5211, in there the SEC admits that Howey is an equity-type test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.920" offset="13916410">I will try to make just three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.968" offset="13932606">One, this is about securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.311" offset="13945980">The statute, which is extraordinarily broad, says note, stock, treasury stock, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, mineral rights, straddle, option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.496" offset="13990702">It's...  there...  it would be difficult to draft the statute that was intended to be more all-inclusive than the words used in these two provisions of the 33 and 34 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.467" offset="14038558">It is manifestly clear that Congress wanted to cover the waterfront, as this Court has said, everything that looks like a security, and wanted to cover the whole range from pure equity, if there is such a thing, to pure debt, if there is such a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.578" offset="14099058">It would be...  and then they put catch-all provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.755" offset="14111701">If the...  if the words didn't cover it, there were catch-all provisions, investment contract is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.668" offset="14131345">It would be irrational for Congress to say, well, we've got a catch-all for those...  from A to Z...  that go from A to H that look more...  look like equities, but not S to Z that look more like debt, and then we're don't...  not sure about the ones in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.362" offset="14190173">The purpose for the catch-all provision is to catch all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.417" offset="14202398">That is what this investment contract was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.813" offset="14212011">Secondly, just two of the cases that were attempted to be distinguished by my colleague, People v. White, he said that did not involve a fixed return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.734" offset="14263629">Well, the language of the case...  this is in 12 P. 2d at 1081...  the individual promised to spay...  pay...  a specified sum on a specified date as principal and earnings for the stated period of time upon the investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.677" offset="14323397">That's pretty much identical to what we have involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.143" offset="14337295">And in the Securities and Exchange Commission v. Universal Services, another one that my colleague referred to, page 234 of 106 F. 2d, at the end of 5 years there would be returned to each member an amount equal to total contributions plus 30 percent per annum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.288" offset="14417856">Now, this case is 14 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.888" offset="14428305">The argument's that being made by the respondent here is an argument that the Blue Sky...  a distinction that the Blue Sky Laws don't make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.291" offset="14469892">Congress did not make this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.975" offset="14480655">The Court has never made this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.676" offset="14491417">It conflicts with 70 years of consistent SEC enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.117" offset="14509180">It is squarely inconsistent with the notion of a broad, flexible, remedial purpose of the securities statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.752" offset="14539691">It would make no sense, would create a gigantic loophole where individuals, by changing the terms of...  from pie in the sky to 14 percent, and they would do that immediately, and Congress would have to deal with it in a way the Congress has already dealt with, and there is no reason to change what they...  what the law has been, and the Eleventh Circuit decision should be reversed.</text>
