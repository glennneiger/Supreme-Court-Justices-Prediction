            <text syncTime="15.992" offset="63948">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.735" offset="86936">In 1996 the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, or AEDPA, was enacted, which imposed a 1-year limitation period upon the filing of Federal habeas petitions following the finality of a State criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.935" offset="139703">In Duncan v. Walker, this Court held that the 1-year limitation period may be tolled during the pendency of a properly filed State post-conviction or other collateral application, but not during the pendency of a Federal habeas application.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.553" offset="194142">Despite that holding, the Ninth Circuit in this case concluded that the district court's dismissal of admittedly mixed Federal habeas petitions was improper and prejudicial because the district court did not provide certain advisements designed to effectuate the Ninth Circuit's practice of stay and abeyance.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.552" offset="814184">So he could never come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.484" offset="825887">Therefore, without prejudice was surely misleading.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.007" offset="1087948">Wouldn't any defendant in his right mind, if he had known that he could not come back into court, that the statute had run, at least have said, well, judge, get rid of the unexhausted claims so that I can at least litigate the ones which I have filed in time and which are exhausted?</text>
            <text syncTime="290.249" offset="1160986">Wouldn't that have been the only sensible thing for him to do if... if he had understood what you understand?</text>

            <text syncTime="296.944" offset="1187736">A Federal habeas petitioner may believe, in fact, that his exhausted claims are unmeritorious or frivolous compared with the claims that he wishes to exhaust in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.400" offset="1225561">So there may be circumstances where a Federal habeas petitioner will not, in fact, object to the dismissal of even his exhausted claims or to the... the dismissal of an entire petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.102" offset="1292330">When Rose v. Lundy was decided, this problem of time didn't exist because there was no statute of limitations on Federal habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.219" offset="1328797">Now that there is this bind, why isn't it appropriate to say the stay and abeyance applies not simply to the Federal claim but to the entire complaint, which is... is the ordinary rule when there's a... a prior action pending or abstention?</text>
            <text syncTime="354.405" offset="1417613">Usually the... the whole complaint just sits in Federal court till the State court is through.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.091" offset="1440287">Why shouldn't this, now with the statute of limitations, the 12 months, in the picture, be the same way?</text>

            <text syncTime="366.594" offset="1466305">I think there are two responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.707" offset="1474769">The first is that Congress would not have contemplated that procedure because Congress, in incorporating section 2254(b)(1) in virtually unaltered form, would have contemplated Rose v. Lundy's application in the way it had always been applied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.038" offset="1536104">The second response is that a stay of the proceeding under those circumstances would make sense only if the claims that are being dismissed as unexhausted can be added back and would, in fact, be--</text>

            <text syncTime="406.553" offset="1626175">Nothing is added back.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.655" offset="1630563">Everything, the entire complaint sits in Federal court while the petitioner goes over to State court to exhaust the State claims and then comes back to the Federal court with nothing to supplement.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.791" offset="1707154">Rose v. Lundy would have absolutely no meaning under that procedure because Rose v. Lundy never contemplated that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.246" offset="1732963">It contemplated the complete dismissal of a mixed petition or, at most, the dismissal of unexhausted claims from a mixed petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1041.353" offset="4165381">A petitioner who files a one-claim petition will most assuredly receive a quicker resolution of that than the petitioner who files a 200-page petition containing hundreds of claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.063" offset="4224209">And that has to be contemplated and anticipated by any would-be Federal habeas petitioner because if that petitioner files a mixed petition under AEDPA, the clock keeps ticking during the pendency of that Federal habeas proceeding no matter how long or how short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.103" offset="4284395">So, again, he's well advised, as the Eighth Circuit noted, to file any claims that he's unsure about in State court first.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.425" offset="4781662">Congress had spoken as to the circumstances under which tolling could be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.639" offset="4798485">In Beggerly, in particular, this Court concluded that under the Federal Quiet Title Act, equitable tolling would be inapplicable because there was already an accrual or tolling provision built in that provided that the limitation period did not begin to run until the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known of the claim of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.224" offset="4876852">AEDPA contains a very similar provision in section 2244(d)(1), subsection (D), which provides that the limitation period does not begin to run until the petitioner was aware of the factual predicate of the claim or claims through the exercise of due diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.626" offset="4942472">In Brockamp, this Court commented upon the tolling provisions in the IRS tax refund statute and noted that because they were numerous and very specific, equitable tolling likewise would be incompatible with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.565" offset="4994194">AEDPA also contains very specific tolling provisions, beyond the one that I just described, tolling where there is a properly filed State post-conviction or other collateral application, tolling where, for instance, unconstitutional State action leads to an impediment to filing, tolling where this Court issues a ruling on an issue of Federal constitutional law that's made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1470.209" offset="5880790">If we're always going to stay mixed petitions, pending the exhaustion of even timely presented unexhausted claims, it certainly leads one to wonder what the purpose of section 2244(b)(1) would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.560" offset="5946201">That also appears to contemplate what the plurality suggested in Rose v. Lundy, which is that the purged Federal habeas petition goes full speed ahead, to use your words, and that it's not, in fact, stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.621" offset="6002416">To stay the Federal habeas petition under those circumstances would also result in delay, which is something that is inimical to AEDPA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.887" offset="6287464">When this Court adopted the total exhaustion rule in Rose, there was no statute of limitations for the filing of Federal habeas petitions, and a prisoner seeking to file a second Federal petition, after fully exhausting State remedies, faced no time bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.977" offset="6347860">But AEDPA added to the mix a 1-year statute of limitations, which in many cases, such as Mr. Ford's, converts the choices under Rose into a complete bar on Federal habeas corpus review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.158" offset="6456529">What Rose said is that a prisoner be afforded a choice, and that choice involves either proceeding on exhausted claims and deleting the unexhausted or dismissing the petition without prejudice to a right to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.458" offset="6525806">No one ever suggested in Rose that the petitioner would lose the right to have even his exhausted claims heard on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.943" offset="6559765">In order to avoid the exhaustion requirement from becoming what would, in effect, be a trap for the unwary pro se prisoner requires nothing more than adding a sentence to what Rose already requires, a sentence made critical by AEDPA, which was nonexistent at the time of Rose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.875" offset="6631445">There is no need for warning, however, if the court issues a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.449" offset="6649731">The lower courts almost unanimously do so and endorse State procedures where the failure to do so would result in a forfeiture of the right to Federal habeas review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.773" offset="6731024">First of all, the Ninth Circuit's stay procedure is somewhat unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.129" offset="6752444">It makes it incumbent upon the prisoner litigant to withdraw his unexhausted claims and then renew a motion to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.155" offset="6788598">So the motion to stay is at the defendant's or the petitioner's election.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Monroe Roadarmel, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3156.711" offset="12626756">With the Court's permission, I'd like to make four brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.060" offset="12668238">The proof is in the pudding regarding stay and abeyance and what we're experiencing in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.832" offset="12691226">We're experiencing greater delays since the enactment of AEDPA than we ever experienced before because of stay and abeyance and relation back, particularly in capital Federal habeas cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.210" offset="12732813">We make mention in footnote 1 of our reply brief of a capital Federal habeas case pending in the Central District Court of California called Reno v. Woodford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.227" offset="12768862">In that case, the district court issued a stay of the purged petition on May 7th, 1999 for the ostensible purpose of allowing the petitioner to exhaust his State court remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.747" offset="12814942">To date, no State court exhaustion petition has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.610" offset="12830407">None is on the horizon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.203" offset="12836780">But under stay and abeyance and relation back, whenever one is filed and the claims are exhausted and added back into the State petition, those claims will be deemed timely by the district court, notwithstanding the fact that at this point in time, at best, they will be presented for exhaustion in State court more than 5 years after the expiration of AEDPA's limitation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.127" offset="12928418">The second point is that Ford in this case knew that the 1997 petitions he filed contained unexhausted claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.731" offset="12958824">He admitted as much to the district court in connection with our motion to dismiss those petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.635" offset="12982439">That's found at pages 56 to 57 and 75 of 78 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.361" offset="13005427">Ford purposely filed mixed petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.624" offset="13014413">He knew of the limitation period as well because he indicated in filings to the district court that he was in a hurry to get his 1997 petitions in in time so that he would have them before the court prior to the expiration of the limitation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.112" offset="13076376">What stay and abeyance does is reward petitioners like Ford who file admittedly mixed petitions knowing full well the identity of the unexhausted claims that they're asserting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.950" offset="13119739">If they're aware of those unexhausted claims, there's no reason why those petitioners should not have and could not have presented those claims in State court first, and they would have received a proper benefit under AEDPA by doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.199" offset="13172715">They would have exhausted the claims so the Federal court could consider them on the merits conceivably if there wasn't some kind of default that was applicable, and they would also toll the limitation period during the pendency of that State proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.028" offset="13220049">Ford was under the misapprehension that his Federal filing tolled the limitation period in much the same way that the petitioner in Duncan was under the misapprehension that his first mixed petition tolled the limitation period in that case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.467" offset="13281802">We know from Duncan v. Walker that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.591" offset="13294341">Finally, advice regarding AEDPA's limitation period, to be meaningful at all, to be more than just a meaningless gesture, has to rely on specific documents and has to provide specific information that a district court is simply in no position to provide at the time a mixed petition is dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.965" offset="13383784">The only documents a district court typically has before it at that time are documents relating to filings by the petitioner in the State supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.842" offset="13415340">The allegations contained in those documents are then compared against the allegations in the Federal habeas proceeding for the purpose of determining whether the claims are exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.728" offset="13450867">The court does not have before it the entire record of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.181" offset="13464660">And even if it did, there are certain circumstances that would warrant tolling that would not be contained in those documents and the court would not be able to make any kind of a reasoned decision or give any kind of reason or correct advice regarding the impact of the limitation period on any unexhausted claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.162" offset="13536549">Stay and abeyance we believe vitiates AEDPA by rendering largely irrelevant the limitation period, rendering the State court tolling provision near surplusage, and in effect, encouraging petitioners to file mixed petitions in Federal court instead of presenting their unexhausted claims in State court first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.257" offset="13620976">Thank you.</text>
