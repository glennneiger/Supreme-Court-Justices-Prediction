            <text syncTime="15.687" offset="62694">As the Commissioner of Social Security has long construed the disability insurance program, there can be no finding of disability unless at least two conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.415" offset="97593">First, the claimant's impairment must be of such severity that she cannot... she is unable to do her previous work.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.051" offset="128104">Second, the impairments must be of such severity that the claimant cannot, considering her age, education, and experience, engage in any other kind of substantial, gainful work which exists in the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.665" offset="178573">Construing and applying those provisions for more than 3 decades, the commissioner has consistently concluded that if a claimant continues to function at a level sufficient to meet the demands of past work, then the claimant is not disabled without the necessity of inquiring into whether that particular past job exists in significant numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.324" offset="253283">That's the most natural reading of the statutory text.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="66.752" offset="266971">Mr. Lamken, this case, I think, involves provisions of both title II and title XVI of the act, and there are regulations under each.</text>

            <text syncTime="79.855" offset="319321">That is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.734" offset="326844">Now, are there any relevant differences in the text of the two statutes or the regs on this issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="89.536" offset="358087">We don't believe that there are any relevant differences, that the commissioner's regulations and the statutes themselves are all phrased in parallel if not identical language throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.876" offset="391419">There is one difference in that for a disability insurance, these title II provisions, you have to be someone who has paid into the program in order to be eligible for benefits on the way out; whereas, title XVI is more of a welfare program where whether you've paid in in the past doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.563" offset="454217">But that simply means that one who has paid into the title II program would get considerably more benefits than one who has not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken</label>
            <text syncTime="123.827" offset="495282">That construction preserves the distinction long recognized in the commissioner's regulations, in fact, recognizing the commissioner's regulations from the earliest days of administering this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.451" offset="537704">Between disability insurance, on the one hand, and insurance against other causes of unemployment, such as technological and economic change, on the other, an individual who's doing a job who remains fully capable of doing that job, but then loses the job because of economic change or perhaps the job never existed in significant numbers and the individual chooses to leave, is not unable to engage in that activity by reason of an impairment, which is the test under the statute for being entitled to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.242" offset="652957">And it made sense for Congress to draw that line because if someone continues to function at a level sufficient to meet the demands of their previous work, it's virtually certain that they're capable of doing some work whether or not that particular past job exists in significant numbers in the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.148" offset="720562">The point isn't that the person is expected to return to that particular past job.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.440" offset="737698">Rather, it is their continued functioning at a level sufficient to meet the demands of that job provides a highly accurate and administrable test of the fact that they continue to function at a level sufficient to meet the demands of work generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.898" offset="791510">In a program that must resolve more than 2 million claims a year, the need for that type of a highly administrable test, that type of highly accurate test is particularly acute.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.929" offset="831634">And this is precisely the type of test one would have expected Congress to provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.455" offset="845740">A potentially large number of Americans today do not work in jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.529" offset="878028">When those workers leave their jobs, whether they quit, are fired for misconduct, or leave for other reasons which are good and sufficient, the court of appeals would preclude the commissioner from denying them benefits based on their continued capacity to do that past job even if that job is still available to them, even if the employer is on the phone begging them to return to their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.730" offset="970919">The commissioner reasonably construed the statute as not compelling that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.900" offset="987533">If there are no questions, I will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="249.955" offset="999758">I have a... a question about the consistency of the argument you're now making with the... with the commissioner's regulation concerning you don't go back more than 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.247" offset="1052944">That seems to be a recognition that even if a person can do the job that he or she did 15 years ago, yet there's a likelihood that maybe that kind of work isn't in abundant supply anymore.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.506" offset="1137998">The concern of that regulation isn't whether or not that particular past job exists in significant numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.308" offset="1169136">It provides an administrable and in fact prophylactic test to make sure that the demands of that job are demands that are ones that are likely to be relevant in the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.557" offset="1206126">It's unlikely that a set of demands of a job would completely disappear from the economy entirely during any one person's lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.540" offset="1230158">But to make assurance doubly sure, to make absolutely certain, the commissioner has set forth an administrable bright line, 15-year rule that says if the job is more than... if you did the job more than 15 years ago, we won't consider it out of that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.552" offset="1286165">But it is not a consideration of whether the particular past job exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.085" offset="1300271">It's a consideration to make sure that your continued ability to the demands of that job is an appropriate and accurate measure of your ability... your level of functioning, and that your level of functioning is consistent with work generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.340" offset="1549270">But the fifth step is designed to work in conjunction with all the other previous steps and, standing alone, does not necessarily represent an accurate determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.975" offset="1579886">Congress provided two conditions that must be met, previous work and other work, precisely because the somewhat abstract inquiry into other work that plaintiff has... the claimant has never done may not be a fully accurate or necessarily an easily administered mechanism for determining the level of work that the claimant can do.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.702" offset="2638785">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="664.903" offset="2659579">Today the commissioner argues against its own theme of providing a remedy when someone is disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.011" offset="2703987">Congress did, indeed, intend to make a difference, to separate step four, previous work, from step five, or other work, but Congress told us what that separation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.621" offset="2762397">At the fourth step, previous work, age is not a factor, education is not a factor, and prior work experience is not a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.510" offset="2809940">This is simply because if a person wasn't too old to do his job or her job in 1995, we assume they weren't too old to do it in 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.194" offset="2856751">If a person had the requisite education and skill level to perform the past job in 1995, then they have the same skill level and education level in 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.454" offset="2905757">And of course, prior work experience is irrelevant at step four because we're talking about the actual job that she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.089" offset="2936268">What Congress didn't intend was to pretend that a job that doesn't exist can still be used to deny benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.485" offset="2981930">Work has to be substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.429" offset="3005649">The commissioner concedes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.981" offset="2999902">It has to be gainful.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.491" offset="3013904">And it has to exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="761.499" offset="3045982">What you're... you're arguing that a job that does exist and that this particular supposedly disabled person used to perform and which is offered to that supposedly disabled person but which that person turns down can, nonetheless, not count against the person's disability.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.888" offset="3467494">And the sequential evaluation is a recipe with alternating steps regarding medical and vocational factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2412.550" offset="9650155">Number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.703" offset="9654753">Number two, the commissioner says that there are no vocational considerations at step four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.040" offset="9672098">We don't care about whether the job exists or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.928" offset="9683696">But that's not the case because the commissioner's own ruling states for a fact that if you can't do your past job as you performed it, we can still deny you benefits at step four by saying that we... you can do your past job as it's performed in the national economy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey A. Lamken</label>
            <text syncTime="2471.537" offset="9886093">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.936" offset="9911693">First, I wanted to point out that step four in fact is a measure of severity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.201" offset="9940741">The question is how severe does the impairment have to be, and the statute tells you exactly how far... how severe it has to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.881" offset="9971461">It has to be so severe that the claimant is unable to do his previous work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.856" offset="9999360">So the step four inquiry of previous work is a measure of severity, and the commissioner has consistently used that measure of severity to determine whether the individual is functioning at a level that is consistent with work generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.207" offset="10044813">In fact, in terms of the deference to which the commissioner's construction is entitled, this has been the commissioner's current construction from the outset of the program, both from before this... the particular provisions we've been discussing were adopted in 1967 and after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.946" offset="10103745">We believe that they're clearly reflected in the commissioner's regulations from 1978, and any... any ambiguity in those regulations was cleared up in 1982 with respect... by the issuance of SSR 82-40.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.154" offset="10156513">The commissioner's current regulations, which became effective September 25th, now make it abundantly clear and explain in absolutely certain terms that the commissioner does not consider whether or not the previous work exists in significant numbers in the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.952" offset="10207713">Because that is the result of a rulemaking, because it is clearly the commissioner's well-considered and longstanding interpretation of the statute, it is entitled to deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2565.093" offset="10260271">In fact, there was a very... there was a lengthy comment period, and then they went through the entire process and were issued quite a few years actually after the comment period was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.108" offset="10300395">But yes, those were not... notice and comment rulemaking, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.975" offset="10311889">In fact, the clarification came in in response to a public comment that particular issue wasn't... was germane to the rulemaking, but it wasn't one the commissioner had initially planned to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.187" offset="10356715">But a commenter said, please clarify that in fact you do consider whether previous work exists in the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.222" offset="10376882">And the commissioner said, no, no, you've got it wrong.</text>
