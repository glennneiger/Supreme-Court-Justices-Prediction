            <text syncTime="79.505" offset="317962">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="88.300" offset="353176">Over 70 years ago, the drafters of the Warsaw Convention created a treaty which set forth the circumstances under which air carrier liability should be created in the event of passenger injury or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.334" offset="409287">The legal regime they created recognized there's circumstances where the passenger should be entitled to a cause of action, but it also expressly recognized the need to limit that liability and set forth certain conditions when that limited liability would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.424" offset="477623">Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention creates a presumption of liability but only when three conditions precedent are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.424" offset="513672">One, there has to be an accident in which the passenger suffers a bodily injury or dies and the accident took place on board the aircraft or during the course of embarking or disembarking.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.600" offset="562364">The issue before the Court here today...  we're dealing with the accident condition precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.802" offset="583158">Was that satisfied in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="147.743" offset="590890">Of course, the...  the Court in Saks in 1985 specifically addressed the issue of what is an accident, and the Court defined an accident as an unusual and unexpected event that's external to the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.201" offset="644702">Of a particular importance to this case is where the Court declined to extend the accident and encompass an injury that results from the passenger's own internal condition and...  and in response to the normal and expected operations of the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.721" offset="706873">Thus, until recently, the courts have held that injuries arising out of the passenger's preexisting medical conditions do not satisfy the accident condition precedent even if there were allegations of air carrier negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.380" offset="961515">But if there are other conditions...  and the argument here is that there are other conditions...  and the heart attack was merely a contributing cause...  it was a condition upon which those other conditions acted...  that does not...  the existence of a heart condition does not immunize Olympic Airlines against liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.409" offset="7673626">But the language in article 17 isn't used...  the term accident isn't used purely in the colloquial sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.013" offset="7699958">What we know from the context of the convention as a whole and the liability system as a whole and from Saks is that sometimes it actually captures less than the colloquial sense of the term accident, sometimes it's more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.093" offset="7756278">For example, the mere fact that somebody has a heart attack typically would be, in the colloquial sense, thought of as an accident.</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.155" offset="7836526">By the same token, the deliberate refusal to help somebody, as the Chief Justice pointed out in his...  his earlier question I think, is...  is normally, in colloquial terms, not thought of as an accident.</text>

            <text syncTime="2391.631" offset="9566459">Well, it's the following sentence that obviously raises at least some questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.225" offset="9580878">And I should say I'm not sure that...  that language in itself should be as troubling as it perhaps appears to some because the...  the situations that...  that the court describes there very often will be, it seems to me, unusual or unexpected situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.315" offset="9649215">But nonetheless, it seems to me that...  that following the adage that the Court sits to review judgments and not opinions, that the Court can simply say, as we...  we suggest would be sufficient, that you do have an unusual and unexpected event when you fail to help a passenger in violation of the standard industry practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.021" offset="9728000">Now, if the standard industry practice would be not to help a passenger under certain circumstances and the claim is still made that it's unusual or unexpected, one would need another benchmark for reference, but the Court doesn't need to reach that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.667" offset="9782648">Now, I would like to...  to also point out that in...  in...  when we're talking about the language of...  of article 17, while I think it's...  it's proper to...  to focus on the language itself and discuss it in...  in the context of Saks, that it's also I think proper to look at the context of the convention as a whole and whether, in fact, competing interpretations of the term accident would lead to absurd consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.966" offset="9903856">Here I think if in fact the definition or the application of the definition that Olympic tries to...  to urge on the Court is accepted, that one is going to find that...  that this convention, which is intended to be the exclusive means of remedy for passengers who suffer death or bodily injury on an international flight, is...  is going to have essentially a hole in it where it doesn't cover situations even, as in this case, whether it's willful misconduct by the airline crew that causes the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.746" offset="10050978">And the focus that...  you know, in terms of whether that is a reasonable understanding to attribute to the parties to the convention under the circumstances, it seems to me when you...  when you say a positive act would be an accident, an omission that would cause an accident would be...  you know, would...  would involve an accident, but there's liability whatsoever for situations in which the...  the conduct itself is the contributing factor, the failure to do something is the...  is a strong contributing factor, doesn't really make any reasonable sense as a construction, and particularly because one of the things that the...  the parties must have understood is that during the time that the passenger is...  is covered by article 17, if you will, from the time of embarkation to the time of disembarkation, the passenger is largely in the control of the airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.612" offset="10286393">The airline determines where the passenger sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.956" offset="10299768">So the passenger's opportunities to engage in self-help are greatly reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.817" offset="10323174">And in that situation, the idea that the...  that the parties thought that airlines could simply say we have passengers on our plane who need our help for medical reasons, and we're not going to provide any help whatsoever and that either causes greater injury...  causes injury in the first place, causes greater injury, or in an unhappy case like this one, actually causes a death, their theory would say there's still no liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.195" offset="10428709">And it would seem to me you would need a very, very clear indication from the text, which doesn't exist here, to reach that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2805.342" offset="11221368">I think it's a...  it's a difficult question as to whether that would have been true because that particular passenger needed to be moved into first class, needed two first class seats, and in fact part of the solution was he was perhaps going to introduce self-induced vomiting as a cure, which obviously would affect other passengers in the cabin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.283" offset="11301094">So, you know, on the facts, one ultimately might have said...  the...  the judgment that was made there actually comported with...  with the usual industry standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2855.004" offset="11420003">So it actually decided the case as a common law negligence case, and when it did so, it found that what the airline had done by not diverting in that particular case was a violation of industry standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.923" offset="11471621">So in that case I think what should have happened in Krys is that the court should have made that inquiry as part of the Warsaw Convention analysis, and if it had done so in fact, it would have limited the recovery in Krys, which was many millions of dollars, to the limits of the Warsaw Convention, supplemented by the agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2900.080" offset="11600248">A flight attendant's refusal to assist an ill passenger can amount to an accident within the meaning of the Warsaw Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.395" offset="11625535">The analysis focuses on whether such conduct is, objectively speaking, unusual or unexpected, taking into account the ordinary practices in the industry and other indicia of what would be expected in the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.020" offset="11680078">At a minimum it's reasonable to construe the convention's term accident, as the United States construes it, to encompass the aberrant conduct of the flight crew, and this Court has ordinarily accorded weight to the United States' reasonable construction of treaties to which it is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.853" offset="11751340">Our reading of the term accident comports with the text structure and purposes of the convention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.779" offset="14119079">It set forth certain things, and the convention wanted to define the liability based on the...  by using that term accident not making reference to various common law notions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.925" offset="14163696">I think one of the problems that we're seeing is that confusing what is the accident...  and that's why I always come back to the injury-producing event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.304" offset="14197133">In the hijacking situation, for example, the accident there isn't the failure of the airline to conduct proper screening and allowing the hijackers to come on board the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.449" offset="14241750">The accident is those hijackers get on the...  on the airplane and they injure a passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.279" offset="14261081">And that...  the injury itself is the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.434" offset="14273724">Just like in the smoke example, if there was a fire someplace and the cabin filled up with smoke, the smoke itself injuring the passenger is the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.219" offset="14304862">Why the smoke got there is completely irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.987" offset="14315938">So when you...  when you start injecting the whole concepts of negligence, I think you upset the whole balance of the convention, and...  and one of the principal goals of the convention was to have a uniformity and to limit the liability of the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.969" offset="14375811">In fact, the Montreal Convention of 1999, which just...  which just entered into force last week here in the United States, retained the term accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.424" offset="14413636">The issue of whether the carrier should be liable for the state of the health of the passenger has always been a very special and unique issue in the context of the convention's history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.084" offset="14452297">Post-ratification conduct from 1945 all the way through the...  all the way to the...  the Montreal Convention of 1999, the contracting states were very careful and very reluctant to make the carriers liable for injuries arising out of their...  out of the state of health of the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.607" offset="14530351">And the...  with respect to the policy arguments where they say...  where the respondents and Solicitor General say that the...  there are certainly policy reasons should be considered in weighing in favor of the passengers in this instance, I think when you look to...  you have to apply the strict terms of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.068" offset="14600255">And each time this Court has been confronted with similar policy arguments, they have been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.527" offset="14618018">In Saks, the...  the passenger was left without a remedy because they couldn't...  because the passenger couldn't satisfy the...  the accident condition precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.040" offset="14648111">The same thing in Floyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.322" offset="14653231">There they couldn't satisfy the bodily injury requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.277" offset="14665038">And in Tseng, where the...  there was no remedy allowed under State law when they couldn't satisfy the accident or the bodily injury conditions precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.529" offset="14706103">Focusing on what the injury-producing event and whether that event is unusual, unexpected, and external to the passenger...  thank you, Your Honor.</text>
