            <text syncTime="1942.199" offset="7768712">First of all, this Court's decision in Sawyer v. Whitley specifically adopted an eligibility test, and that eligibility test draws the line at where that person is statutorily eligible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.671" offset="7886681">Additionally, Your Honor, that rule that we propose is well-rooted in this Court's habeas doctrine dating back to Townsend v. Burke, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.271" offset="7933074">This Court has recognized that a sentence that falls... the severity of a sentence that falls within a statutory range is not amenable to habeas review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.559" offset="7970168">Additionally, the recent case, Your Honor, of Harris v. the United States, where the issue was whether Apprendi applied to mandatory minimums.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.135" offset="8008516">This Court held... actually, part of the opinion is a plurality opinion, but the holding is that the... it does not matter if the sentence is more based on some false fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2080.875" offset="8323448">That doesn't make sense, but rather manifest injustice, and the key word is manifest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.005" offset="11255954">For instance, in the State of Texas, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner constitutes a future danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.179" offset="11288660">In the State of Louisiana, for instance, the state has to... one of the statutory aggravating factors are that the crime was committed in a heinous manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.581" offset="11330247">Those inquiries are more subjective and less objective than the inquiry required under the application the... of the exception that we propose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.605" offset="11374341">Additionally, Your Honors, the equities weigh strongly in favor of applying the rule in non-capital sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.386" offset="11413525">Justice Scalia asked a question as to why this rule may be necessary because there would always be ineffective assistance of counsel, and frankly there's an answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.493" offset="11457933">And that answer is, there will not always be a meritorious... under a meritorious claim and there will not necessarily be ineffective assistance of counsel for one reason at least, and that is, under Carrier, this Court held that to rely on the ineffective assistance of counsel as cause in Federal court, that claim had to have been raised below in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.646" offset="11570573">So there could be a scenario, this scenario, if Mr. Haley had not properly raised ineffective assistance of counsel below in state habeas or on state appeal as required by state law, he would not be entitled to rely on that ineffective assistance of counsel for cause in Federal court, and so the court would be presented again with this fundamentally unjust situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3192.915" offset="12771579">Your Honors, in relation, briefly here at the end to Almendarez-Torres, we agree with the Solicitor General that if Almendarez-Torres does not control, then this case is... is very easy and there need not be any application of Sawyer, and that is because, as I said earlier, he would be actually innocent of the enhanced offense of theft by habitual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.439" offset="12885682">As pointed out in our brief, Almendarez-Torres is not controlling because in this case there is an additional... there is something else that must be proven in addition to the fact of the prior convictions, and that is the date of the commission of the second prior felony offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.877" offset="13359438">If the Court decides that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim should have... or cause and prejudice should have been reached first, since it was not presented in the question presented, the Court should not reach any issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.994" offset="13415967">Mr. Haley should be able to go about his life and not be subject to a day more in prison that the state concedes is unlawful, and as the court advised... as the state advised the district court, if this Court were to reverse, it intends to put Mr. Haley back in prison for an additional 10 years that it specifically admits is unlawful and not authorized by the legislature, and a remand presumably would result in the same sort of injustice visited upon Mr. Haley by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.118" offset="13576464">For those reasons, Your Honor, I respectfully suggest that the Court affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and hold that Mr. Haley has sufficiently established that he is actually innocent, reach the merits of the claim, and... and that's the only issue the Court needs to resolve.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.958" offset="13679804">I'd like to quickly revisit an exchange Justice Scalia had with Mr. Albritton concerning Almendarez-Torres, and make the point that even if this Court were at some future date to decide to overrule Almendarez-Torres, which I don't believe is presented in this case, that would not necessarily mean that the actual innocence exception would extend to non-capital sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.135" offset="13764441">The inquiries are altogether different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.871" offset="13771442">The former, what was at... the case at common law at the time of the founding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.791" offset="13787115">The latter is, as the exchange illuminated, a question of what 28 U.S.C. Section 2254 provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.503" offset="13821910">And I would note 2255, with respect to Federal habeas, explicitly includes in its statutory text as one of the grounds for granting habeas that a sentence is, quote, in excess of the maximum authorized by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.422" offset="13873633">That's in 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.296" offset="13881156">It is not in 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.964" offset="13891814">The only ground for granting habeas in 2254 with respect to a state conviction is if someone is held in custody of violation of the laws or Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.488" offset="13933923">And so it is altogether possible that this Court could decide at some future date to... to overrule Almendarez-Torres and then yet nonetheless decide that in looking to the ends of justice that now repeal language from the habeas statute, that there is not an obligation to excuse procedural default for every single conceivable sentencing error.</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.865" offset="14219389">Cause and prejudice can address situations where relief is merited, such as perhaps Mr. Haley's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.468" offset="14245825">On the other side, there is the risk of expanding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.017" offset="14260036">Non-capital sentencing, unlike actual innocence, I didn't do it, of the crime, unlike actual innocence of death, non-capital sentencing is virtually ubiquitous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.214" offset="14300787">Interestingly, Mr. Haley's amici law professors in footnote 13 of their brief acknowledge the ability of the slippery slope to extend beyond just increasing the statutory maximum to sentences within a range and to a whole host of factors that the states used for sentencing factors, facts... factors such as the amount of drugs, such as the value of stolen goods, such as the status of a victim, whether the victim is elderly, whether the victim is a police officer.</text>
