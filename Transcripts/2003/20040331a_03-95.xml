            <text syncTime="11.146" offset="44513">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.822" offset="59246">In its decisions a few years ago in the Ellerth and Faragher cases, this Court held that where a supervisor has created a hostile work environment by acts of sexual harassment, the liability of the employer is not strict, but rather is subject to an affirmative defense which centers around the opportunities provided by the employer for corrective or preventive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.689" offset="150674">The question here is whether that affirmative defense should continue to be available where there is an allegation that the hostile work environment resulted in a constructive discharge, and we submit that it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.034" offset="200098">In our view there is nothing about a claim of constructive discharge that changes the Ellerth-Faragher analysis of hostile work environments.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.148" offset="240536">A supervisor's acts which create a hostile work environment don't produce strict liability because they are not acts of agency; that is, they are not the acts of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.467" offset="281809">They don't bear the imprimatur of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.818" offset="291213">They aren't ratified by the employer, and they are not the sorts of things which could only be done by somebody invoking the authority of the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.991" offset="323918">Mr. Knorr, I'm... I had a hard time, in reading the briefs on this case, figuring out what we ought to do with the suggestion that there's a constructive discharge theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.473" offset="385881">Now, I don't think this Court has ever weighed in on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.826" offset="403226">It comes out of the labor law context I guess.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.163" offset="420571">I'm wondering, you know, in... in Ellerth and Faragher, what we said was that when no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.533" offset="494132">So I'm wondering if we shouldn't just try to look at the facts in this case and ask whether what the supervisors did amounted to a tangible employment action and that would answer the... the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.997" offset="559961">I... I don't know that viewing it through the lens of a constructive discharge is helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.024" offset="583993">What she says is that the supervisors... that she had taken tests to qualify for a promotion, that the supervisors had hidden the results of those tests and had thereby prevented any promotion, and that there was a false arrest I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.687" offset="674691">Now, why shouldn't we just look to see if those actions occurred, and if so, whether they amounted to a tangible employment action?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.916" offset="719621">Wouldn't that answer the question?</text>

            <text syncTime="181.857" offset="727353">Justice... Justice O'Connor, if we haven't made this clear, then the Court has my sincerest apologies because that is exactly what we suggest the Court should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.010" offset="768000">If the underlying actions of the supervisor amounted... which... which provoked the constructive discharge amounted to a tangible employment action, then there is no affirmative defense.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="202.413" offset="809587">But... but Justice O'Connor is going a little bit further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.385" offset="821499">I think she is suggesting that there cannot be a constructive discharge without some tangible employment action because constructive discharge itself attributes to the employer the desire to get rid of the employee, and that desire cannot simply be communicated through some lower... lower people.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.814" offset="923167">Now, maybe the... the tangible employment action is the refusal of the employer to respond when the obscene actions of... of the... of the coworkers here are brought to the employer's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.217" offset="1000803">That would be I... would that qualify as tangible action in... in your part... in your estimation?</text>

            <text syncTime="257.935" offset="1031732">I'm not sure if it would be tangible action or not, but it would certainly indicate that if the employer didn't respond, that it was in some sense ratifying or approving what it has done.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.247" offset="1076976">The only person that can discharge is the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.188" offset="1084709">You have to pin it on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.045" offset="1092127">I don't know how... how subordinates alone can... can produce a situation that amounts to a constructive discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.590" offset="1126296">That, Justice Scalia, is partly true and it partly is not true because the precise elements of what you need to prove to... to get a constructive discharge vary quite widely from court to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.510" offset="1178018">And in some courts what you say is quite accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.739" offset="1186900">There has to be some proof of an intention on the part of the employer, even if it's only through a failure to respond to a complaint, to get rid of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.739" offset="1222949">But in other courts... and... and this includes the Third Circuit... that is not really the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.993" offset="1459931">There are such jurisdictions and they include the Third Circuit, but I need to be a little more expansive than that because in all jurisdictions, including... including the Third Circuit, there is an inquiry into whether the employee acted reasonably, but... and in some jurisdictions, that inquiry is directed to... to the question of whether the employee tried to resolve this... this matter internally.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.284" offset="1549061">In other jurisdictions, including the... the Third Circuit, the inquiry into employee reasonableness is tied only to the question of how bad were the conditions; that is, were these conditions so bad that a reasonable person would quit?</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.901" offset="4311562">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.157" offset="4344581">An employer is strictly liable for a constructive discharge in any harassment that has preceded it only when the constructive discharge comes about as a result of an official company act, such as a demotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.623" offset="4394423">If the constructive discharge comes about as a result of a supervisor's creation of a hostile environment, then the employer has an affirmative defense and can show that the plaintiff unreasonably bypassed available opportunities for correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.136" offset="4460460">Now, the requirement of an official company act as a predicate for strict liability comes from the Court's decision in Ellerth and is supported by two important considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.934" offset="4511660">First, a company act is the kind of act that is likely to be documented and subject to higher levels of review, and so it's the kind of act over which the employer can exert the most control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.605" offset="4562338">And that heightened potential to control makes it fair to hold the employer strictly liable, even if in a particular case the employer would otherwise be able to show that it acted reasonably and the plaintiff did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.715" offset="4622838">It... it... second of all, furthering title VII's... the... recognizing the affirmative defense when there's not an official company act, furthers title VII's prophylactic purposes because it gives the employer an extra incentive to create policies that will help to prevent discrimination from occurring in the first place and it gives employees an added incentive to complain before problems become Title VII violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.505" offset="6841992">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.615" offset="6866442">Pursuant to title VII, the general rule has been is that employers are liable for the discriminatory acts of their supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.338" offset="6913254">The question presented is whether a constructive discharge is the equivalent of a formal discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.844" offset="6947318">One of the greatest difficulties in dealing with the law that we're addressing today is one of semantics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.914" offset="6987651">A formal discharge is the equivalent of a constructive discharge by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.913" offset="7023595">It is a... it is a matter of methodology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.851" offset="7051389">The United States and the petitioner would have this Court define the culpability of the employer for the supervisor's acts as a matter of official act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.492" offset="7149923">That leads this Court down an incredibly complex road of... of definitional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.267" offset="7192973">If the Court goes back to Meritor, the Chief Justice's opinion, where the Court held clearly there is no automatic liability for the employer's being responsible for the wayward acts, clearly outside the scope of employment, clearly not authorized, but we're not going to find a... a... an automatic liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.446" offset="7329750">What the United States wants to do and why the respondent believes that the Third Circuit... that the Third Circuit Court of Appeals decided this case properly is to devise a general rule and underline if proven, if the constructive discharge is proven, then the obvious occurs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.573" offset="7578227">And the issue in the question presented is when a... if... if we stick to that issue, is that is a constructive discharge a tangible employment action.</text>
