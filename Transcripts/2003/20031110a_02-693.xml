            <text syncTime="25.801" offset="103131">The United States Trustee, for all of its rhetoric about the statute's plain text, actually says that the statute contains two errors in two different places, but the list of compensable providers inadvertently includes a reference to the attorney and that the statute's so-called payees' list inadvertently omits the necessary conjunction or.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.720" offset="190798">We say there was a different mistake, that the payees' list inadvertently omits the reference to the debtor's attorney, and our reading of the two is the superior one.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.835" offset="231340">It is the one that's most consistent with the... the structure of the statute as a whole, with the past bankruptcy practice, with the legislative history, and frankly, with common sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.847" offset="475324">I mean, how does that work?</text>
            <text syncTime="121.448" offset="485773">I... and I... I do agree that the chapter 7... the... the debtor's attorney really is often required to do some very important things to get the chapter 7 filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.284" offset="537078">But if the... if it's an 11 first, as this one was, could the chapter 11 court have authorized the work to be done?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="142.253" offset="568947">According to the U.S. Trustee, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.398" offset="577515">Let me, if I could, just step back and put this in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.083" offset="588278">This is a converted case, just like, for example, the Hartford Underwriters case this Court had a few terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.656" offset="610534">And so I take it the question might be, look, if they were a debtor's attorney at one point... and we all agree that for the chapter 11 proceedings, they clearly were authorized to be paid under 330(a)... could that authorization have continued?</text>
            <text syncTime="166.235" offset="664869">And I think the answer is no because at some point there will be a fee application and the fee application will be under 330(a), and what will happen is exactly what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.811" offset="703216">The U.S. Trustee or the objector will say, look, for the period that it was a chapter 7, there's a... a gap in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.553" offset="778136">Our position is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.039" offset="784091">The U.S. Trustee's position is that it... they're without power.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.300" offset="797153">I think it's an important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.415" offset="801646">We view the structure of the statute to operate just as it has for... the Bankruptcy Code has for 100 years, and that is, that the bankruptcy court is a gatekeeper.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.817" offset="843233">It has to decide, in what are now the literal terms of the statute, whether the services of the debtor's attorney are both necessary and beneficial to the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.157" offset="876565">The position of the U.S. Trustee is that even when the services are both necessary and beneficial to the estate... that is to say, even when they produce more money for the creditors, which is the whole point, after all... you still can't perform the services and be compensable--</text>

            <text syncTime="270.526" offset="1082096">There is a passing suggestion in the Government's brief... and, Mr. Chief Justice, that is at 1a of the gray brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.940" offset="1111667">There is a suggestion by the U.S. Trustee that if the debtor's attorney really needs to do something, the trustee's lawyer will hire the debtor's lawyer, and so it all will work out in the end, and I take it that's a point you're picking up.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.262" offset="1169032">The statute is much more limited than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.574" offset="1178227">It says the trustee, with the court's approval, may employ for a specified special purpose, other than to represent the trustee, and it goes on to say, an attorney that has represented the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.894" offset="1219500">The way this works... and we have tried very hard to find out how often this happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.776" offset="1235069">Mr. Lamie's firm, for example, has been doing bankruptcy for 23 years and has represented the debtor in more than 4,000 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.071" offset="1268193">In that entire time, the trustee has hired the debtor's counsel two times.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.786" offset="1319079">Well, we know that that's not the case, Justice Souter, because the Bankruptcy Code does, as Justice Kennedy has suggested, give important responsibilities to the debtor qua debtor, not that are distinct from the duties of the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.039" offset="1372056">And let me give you an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.358" offset="1377384">And so those are jobs that can't be handled by the trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="658.299" offset="2633143">In 1997, there were two bills that were proposed in the Congress that were a part of general correction legislation that had a variety of different provisions, including one fix for this one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2894.535" offset="11578096">That can't be a result that Congress contemplated under the U.S. Trustees' vision of what Congress was up to--</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.488" offset="11605891">But can't that be checked by the court under 329 and say that's too much?</text>

            <text syncTime="2905.103" offset="11620310">--Precisely, precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.423" offset="11625639">But that's my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.332" offset="11629296">What results is the 329 fees are subject to a Lessing standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.648" offset="11654583">They just have to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.218" offset="11660852">They aren't subjected to all the laundry list of 330.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.395" offset="11673496">So the result of this change, if there was a change, would only have been to decrease judicial oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.371" offset="11701394">Retainers are subject to less to judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.222" offset="11712888">The second point I should make is that don't come away from the argument that this... believing that this case is limited to chapter 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.992" offset="11739951">It applies equally to chapter 11 debtor out of possession cases and chapter 12 and 13 cases for services that are beneficial to the estate, but not the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.940" offset="11779657">The U.S. Trustee has always pitched this as somehow a case limited to chapter 7, but that's not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.141" offset="11800555">And the Pro-Snax case from the Fifth Circuit, for example, is a chapter 11 debtor out of possession case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.540" offset="11826155">Third, Justice Souter, I still don't understand what the answer is to your reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.773" offset="11851024">Justice Breyer, Justice Souter said, okay, there are a list of three people who can get the check: the trustee, the examiner, the professional person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.089" offset="11876310">Fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.491" offset="11881953">But we also know, as Justice Stevens has said, that the statute's reference to the attorney has always been to the attorney, the same reference to the attorney in 331 is a reference to the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.356" offset="11921345">321 says a chapter 7 attorney can get a retainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.699" offset="11934720">Justice Souter has said isn't the literal language, if we're going to follow the literal language, that the money can go to the trustee, to which I said, and that's... you know, the trustee directed Mr. Lamie to do these things, and therefore the trustee just owes the money back to the debtor's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.696" offset="11990727">That rationalizes all of the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.584" offset="12002325">The important thing then in deciding whether to follow the literal text is, is there anything to support?</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.341" offset="12025313">Is there a whit... a whit... of indication in the history of the statute that Congress intended to do what the U.S. Trustee has hypothesized?</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.907" offset="12059585">Is there a word that from 1898 to 1994 Congress decided to make this choice to eliminate fees that are both necessary and beneficial?</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.104" offset="12100336">Those are the only fees we're talking about, those that benefit the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.653" offset="12114547">Did Congress intend to eliminate them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.389" offset="12121548">Is there any indication of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.097" offset="12128340">And the answer to that question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.848" offset="12139311">And that's important because the U.S. Trustee is not correct to say that when a chapter 7 is initiated or if the case is converted, that the debtor and the debtor's attorney leaves the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.298" offset="12185182">There are ongoing duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.934" offset="12191660">There's the 341 hearing, the meeting with the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.467" offset="12201796">There is the duty of the debtor's attorney to transfer the materials to the trustee, to cooperate with the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.632" offset="12230426">Here, there was an adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.861" offset="12239412">The trustee wasn't substituted as counsel for 8 months, and somebody had to tell the trustee about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.260" offset="12265012">There are real responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.746" offset="12270968">And we're not talking about, in any particular case, a ton of money, but it is important.</text>
