            <text syncTime="68.552" offset="274181">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.025" offset="288078">The United States, joined by seven other nations, has concluded that the decision in this case is an error and should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.410" offset="317544">The reason is that the plaintiffs here are foreign claimants which allege that they paid too much for vitamins outside of U.S. commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.274" offset="348996">Trying these claims in our courts would conflict with the principle that the Sherman Act does not regulate the competitive conditions of other nations' economies, and stretching the antitrust laws to include such claims is a recipe for international discord and for heavy new burdens on our Federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.699" offset="426736">Now, when Congress passed the FTAIA in 1982, it did not expand the domain of the antitrust laws, but rather clarified limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.115" offset="468428">It required both an effect on U.S. commerce and the claim arising from that same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.599" offset="494341">As the Government explains, this is language that refers most naturally to a claim of the plaintiff before the court, and not a claim of some other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.786" offset="531122">The court of appeals, of course, believed that it was enough for somebody else to have a claim arising from a U.S. effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.818" offset="4059220">Given the key role of deterrence, both in the opinion below and in the respondents' arguments here, the United States thinks it important to offer the Court an accurate understanding of how international cartel enforcement really works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.465" offset="4109793">It's only in the past 8 years that we've begun to see dramatic success in detecting and punishing international cartels, and that has come about only by international cooperation with other enforcement agencies and through the use of amnesty programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.356" offset="4173322">There's nothing in the FTAIA, much less any clear congressional statement, in statute that after all was jurisdiction-limiting in intent, that would require jeopardizing our progress in those enforcement efforts through a dramatic extraterritorial application of U.S. treble damages litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.927" offset="4243644">Even if there were, established principles of standing under Section 4 of the Clayton Act would nonetheless preclude that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.278" offset="4365061">The... the important point, Justice Kennedy, is that under these amnesty programs, there is no amnesty given for civil liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.533" offset="4394109">So it is our experience that when a company finds that its employees have been engaged in wrongdoing, it balances the potential for freedom from criminal liability against the certainty that civil treble damages will follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.894" offset="4447504">And to make the type of sea change in the law that's advocated by respondents here to provide for unquantifiable, potentially unknowable worldwide liability will in our judgment lead to the risk that companies who discover this type of conduct will instead hunker down and simply hope not to be detected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.227" offset="4520856">The... the effect will be even more dramatic with respect to the amnesty programs of some of our trading partners, such as the countries who have filed briefs here, because in those systems, treble damages are simply unknown.</text>

            <text syncTime="1306.711" offset="5226789">The respondents have attempted to cite district court cases, but if you look at each of those, you will find an effect on U.S. commerce, and with respect to the Industria Siciliana case mentioned in their brief, you'll find that that was a case that was expressly disapproved by the Congress when it passed the FTAIA, even if it could be read that way, so that under the FTAIA, we think the natural reading is simply to ask the court to look at the claim before it and to ask whether the U.S. effect gives rise to a claim on behalf of the party in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.695" offset="5358759">Where the United States is bringing a claim, any time we can meet the direct, the effects test of Hartford and Alcoa, we will always have a claim that has arisen from a U.S. effect, so that there is no danger here to U.S. enforcement, which continues under the application of the FTAIA without any burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.047" offset="5432111">But as to a private plaintiff, the private plaintiff must show that its own claim is one that has been given rise to by a U.S. effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.513" offset="5474011">Turning to standing, we think even if the FTAIA did not apply, that the proper result here would nonetheless be reached under the Clayton Act, not only for the... by reason of rationale that Justice Stevens mentioned in his question, but also because the plaintiffs are not within the zone of interests that are protected by the antitrust laws under this Court's opinion in Matsushita and elsewhere, which makes clear that our Sherman Act is not intended to set the competitive conditions for other nations' economies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.275" offset="5613087">And finally, if the Court simply were to apply the remoteness or proximate cause rationale that's also very prevalent in the Court's antitrust standing cases, which excludes injuries, for example, to shareholders, to employees, that the case also would not be proper under a remoteness rationale, because these plaintiffs do not in fact allege that they were the victims of an overcharge in U.S. commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.795" offset="5727086">They do not even allege, Justice Ginsburg, that they made any attempt to purchase in U.S. commerce, but would rather seek to use speculative transactions that never occurred to make an end run around the FTAIA by defining a so-called one-world market or one big conspiracy theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.728" offset="5806811">To do that would certainly again be completely contrary to this Court's holding in Matsushita, where the Japanese aspects of a conspiracy were sought to be put together with American aspects into one big claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.987" offset="5859892">The Court plainly rejected that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.318" offset="5869192">Indeed, if we were to proceed on that theory, why would not the claim here be equally seen to have been given rise to by effects in France, effects in Great Britain, Russia, or elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.099" offset="5924362">There is simply no limiting principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.672" offset="5930632">And as Mr. Shapiro suggests, to pursue this path would embroil the district courts around the country in all forms of satellite litigation, and it's very important to recognize that this is not a test that would apply only to a notorious worldwide criminal conspiracy, such as was at issue here, but would apply to rule of reason cases, joint venture cases, could apply even to Section 2 cases under the Sherman Act any time a plaintiff was able to allege that some other plaintiff somewhere suffered from a U.S. effect that was related to that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.803" offset="6067200">And the cases that Mr. Shapiro mentioned are good indications of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.258" offset="6088934">So in our judgment, the Court should pay attention to the practical realities of enforcement and avoid doing damage to them, avoid creating friction with our trading partners in a situation where whatever else can be said, there is no clear congressional statement that the FTAIA should be read to expand jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.914" offset="6175556">In fact, the statute cannot on its terms expand jurisdiction by reason of its language, which begins with a statement that the antitrust laws shall not apply, and then puts the plaintiff back where it was prior to the FTAIA if certain conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.183" offset="6236682">In no case can the statute operate to give additional causes of action or create additional standing on behalf of parties who didn't have it prior to the FTAIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.821" offset="6283180">In short, all the Court need do is evaluate respondents' own claim rather than the hypothetical claims of others, and doing so will require dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.657" offset="6318602">If the Court has no further questions, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.433" offset="6481711">--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but not because the FTAIA applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.908" offset="6499579">We have to prove that we would have had a claim before the Sherman Act, before the '82 Act was adopted, and we intend to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.082" offset="6524238">I do know... do, however, think that the '82 Act is illuminating because it eliminated claims of other people and not ours, and that would be the victims of a U.S. export cartel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.691" offset="6566661">Now, the reason our position is critical is the one identified by Justice Kennedy, and that is that the conspirators' cartel encompassed a worldwide market for bulk vitamins and the worldwide market is relevant because geographic boundaries don't have any meaning here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.499" offset="6629982">A conspiracy limited to U.S. commerce would have collapsed as U.S. purchasers bought abroad, as Justice Scalia has said, and there is a critical fact about the nature of the worldwide market and how the United States enforces the antitrust laws that has not been touched on in the first half hour, and that is that U.S. antitrust law... and Mr. Chief Justice, this is prior to the 1982 Act... deems their conspiracy... Justice Breyer, it's not the individual transactions, it's the entire conspiracy... illegal, lock, stock, and barrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.141" offset="6756519">The U.S. Government in this case prosecuted the petitioners not for price-fixing in the United States and not for market allocation in the United States, but price-fixing and market allocation in the United States and abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.390" offset="6813466">If the petitioners are right about what the Sherman Act means, including after the 1982 Act, then it will be the prosecutions of the United States that fall along with our position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.726" offset="6854844">No, no, I mean, their argument I take it is simply, of course, there... the quinine cartel, which I had heard of, I'd not heard, the quinine cartel sets in Holland and raises the price of quinine that's sold all over the world, and of course it violates our law and we're out there and they're lobbing these shells at us in a sense, and so of course we can bring a claim against them, it hurts us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.092" offset="6952333">But other countries have different laws, and as far as they're concerned, those laws... what they are doing in Holland is fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.889" offset="6991517">And so what business do we have telling Uruguay, which thinks depression cartels, or Japan, which thinks oppression cartels are the greatest thing, and they may be, and so does Holland think that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.431" offset="7053688">And what business do we have saying that a citizen of Japan who's hurt by something that the Japanese think is just fine and the Dutch think is just fine come to our court and enforce our law against those other countries where it doesn't affect us?</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.839" offset="7115337">That's their claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.942" offset="7355768">In this case, the Federal Government prosecuted Mr. Shapiro's clients for price-fixing and market allocation in the United States and abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.837" offset="7395265">That is, we don't care that Ecuador likes price-fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.767" offset="7406968">I will come to the fact that they don't, but it doesn't matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.190" offset="8332748">So I want to talk, Justice Scalia, about pre-1982 law on whether or not the Sherman Act actually made the transactions, if we were to focus on them, illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.988" offset="8371931">And then, Justice Breyer, I want to come to whether the '82 act changes that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.649" offset="8438596">To read from the opinion that... that established the decree, several agreements relating to manufacture and trade, we deem the European markets are but some of the links in the chain which was designed to enthrall the entire commerce in titanium.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.789" offset="8495125">Timken Roller Bearing did the exact same thing, and the Solicitor General argued in Timken that acts would have... that those acts would have violated the Sherman Act even if they had related solely to the commerce of the foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.448" offset="8545698">Those precedents, Justice Scalia, if you look at them, do say that the underlying activities that are in the overt acts, if you will, in furtherance of the conspiracy, are illegal under U.S. law, and that's for a good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.236" offset="8596898">That is, if we don't go after them, the conspiracy itself will be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.828" offset="10227252">This was settled in Hartford Fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.409" offset="10237597">Mr. Shapiro is relying on the dissent in Hartford Fire for the proposition that comity concerns are built into the definition in the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.416" offset="10285662">And although he says the issue is nonetheless here, his page... page 41, note 16 of their brief in the court of appeals expressly acknowledged that the question is different from the question of comity presented in Hartford Fire.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.443" offset="10389734">Justice Kennedy, the courts of appeals leading up to Hartford Fire were unanimous and then Hartford Fire cites with approval, for example, a case called Mannington Mills, and that is that the courts of appeals had always understood up to the point of Hartford Fire, and then Hartford Fire applied the same analysis, that comity is a restriction on the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by the Sherman Act, and so Hartford Fire endorses it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.621" offset="10490462">And then subsequent to Hartford Fire... and Justice Breyer, I am coming back to the substance of the comity analysis... but let me just say that subsequent to Hartford Fire, the courts of appeals have applied comity robustly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.788" offset="10535079">Let me just cite two cases for you, Metro Industries, which is 82 F. 3d 839, and Nippon Paper, 109 F. 3d 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.165" offset="10568620">They have continued to look at all of the different considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.417" offset="10581577">And so, just to return to structure and then to substance, the district court and the court of appeals had no cause to consider whether or not this case would interfere with international relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.524" offset="10626090">Now, that analysis in the case of monopolization or unfair trade practices would preclude the exercise of U.S. antitrust jurisdictions for several reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.627" offset="10902465">It would be to say you can't get greater damages here than single damages, because that's the norm.</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.548" offset="11146136">We have, however, a dilemma that Congress recognized, and that is, as Justice Scalia said, with respect to the great majority of the world, and we cite in our brief the OECD's formal report on cartels, the seminal report to the Attorney General on international antitrust, a source after source after source that says there is grave under enforcement of cartels, and I can illustrate it here with two facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.593" offset="11246341">The first is, with respect to more than half of the volume of commerce in bulk vitamins, more than half of it, they are going to get away with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.120" offset="11276434">And that leads to the second fact, because there's no enforcement, public or private, that leads to the second fact, and that is, if they win here, they will net from activities that are per se illegal under Sherman Act, net, net, net, $13 billion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2905.991" offset="11623863">They don't think a monopoly is a bad thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.861" offset="11631386">But what we do know is that everyone agrees that price-fixing is bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.513" offset="11649985">It is not an infringement on their ability to regulate primary conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.248" offset="13048895">But you're saying that a foreign company has a cause of action by reason of the fact that had the American company not purchased at the artificially high conspiratorial price, but at a lower price, they might have purchased from that... from that intermediate person, and... whereas Illinois Brick would clearly bar the first suit, you're saying it doesn't bar the second suit as a rationale for allowing them to sue here, and that strikes me as very strange.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.772" offset="13199047">The first two relate to the technical requirements of Illinois Brick and the third explains why you shouldn't read Illinois Brick to bar such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.707" offset="13226736">The first is that we're not merely talking about arbitragers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.040" offset="13240111">We're talking about, there are companies in the United States that made vitamins and they would have sold to our clients absent the cartel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.565" offset="13266233">The intermediary isn't a necessary part of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.965" offset="13275847">The second is that even though you buy from an intermediary, under Illinois Brick you still have a claim, and that is you have a right to bring an action for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.602" offset="13314403">The third is that, look, our reading, the one that says, and that Justice Breyer has hypothesized, accept what they're saying and allow the claim only if the injury is tied into a worldwide market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.151" offset="13368529">That's a reading that protects U.S. interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.992" offset="13379918">To say that Congress set up the structure, whereas... that would allow you to look at the foreigners through clause 2, but eliminate of their claims on Illinois brick grounds, would render the statute and its... its provisions against cartels ineffectual.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="3400.177" offset="13600705">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.709" offset="13606766">The court of appeals and Mr. Goldstein have relied on the deterrence concept here, but it's important to remember that the Government, supported by seven of our allies and trading partners, has said that this position is going to undermine deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.807" offset="13655144">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.428" offset="13657652">Because it's going to reduce the detection of international price-fixing cartels, and you get zero deterrence if you don't have actual detection of overseas cartel behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.025" offset="13700075">The key to getting the detection is the amnesty program and international cooperation with our allies, and right now, our allies are shrinking away from the United States, information-sharing agreements that are needed here to investigate and prosecute cartels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.044" offset="13760157">The Justice Department officials have been giving speeches about that bad effect, so there's a very serious danger of undermining deterrence here if this position is accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.733" offset="13794847">Now, on comity of nations, that is not a judicial balancing of one factor and another equitable factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.425" offset="13821597">That's a rule of statutory interpretation that this Court has applied ever since the Charming Betsy case 200 years ago, and what it means is that if a particular alternative is presented that broadly construes our laws to intrude into the affairs of other nations and cause friction, that interpretation is going to be rejected, and that was certainly not rejected in the Hartford case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.989" offset="13903935">Professor Areta, in his treatise, pointed out that our antitrust laws do not rule the entire commercial world, and that's a concept that's written right into Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.577" offset="13946253">It applies to... its domain is commerce among the states and commerce with foreign nations, not commerce within foreign nations, not commerce between foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.013" offset="13988049">And the reason the FTAIA drew the sharp lines that it did is the reason that Justice Breyer was driving at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.686" offset="14010723">Other nations have their own policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.067" offset="14020232">They disapproved treble damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.050" offset="14028173">They have their own procedures for dealing with antitrust issues instead of per se rules and rules of reason, they have prohibitions and then a series of exemptions applied by expert administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.017" offset="14072059">So if our courts take these issues over and apply treble damages remedies, they override procedure, they override the... the substance of these laws, and... and they are certainly going to override policies against treble damages, which have provoked huge international discord in the form of claw-back statutes, blocking statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.388" offset="14149486">Our closest allies have responded to overreaching that way, and Congress wanted to minimize that problem with passage of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.033" offset="14176131">Now, the Timken case that counsel referred to was a case where the Government was going after contracts overseas that injured our commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.371" offset="14209463">The Government was not going after practices overseas that had effects overseas and not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.804" offset="14231197">Counsel referred to the weight of scholarship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.634" offset="14238511">I read all those articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.113" offset="14244362">There's only one of them that suggests that everybody in the world can come trooping into our courts if some person here has an antitrust claim from two private practitioners who had no background in the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.992" offset="14287935">They simply asserted that without any analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.294" offset="14297130">I don't think that constitutes weighty scholarship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.836" offset="14311340">Now, the National Bank of Canada case that counsel referred to, if in fact that's the case that Congress meant to approve, that means they're out of court, because that's a case where the complaint was dismissed because the injury was felt in Canada and was not felt in the United States, and the Second Circuit dismissed that claim as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.340" offset="14385319">Now, on this worldwide market point, the... the statutes here hinge jurisdiction on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.674" offset="14418651">Lawyers can always draw a global conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.305" offset="14429205">Economists can always say there's a global market, and these issues would be enormous quagmires for the district courts if that's what our courts' jurisdiction turned on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.600" offset="14462328">Congress did not intend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.283" offset="14469120">It intended a clear jurisdictional benchmark by focusing on our commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.027" offset="14488033">There has to be an injury to our commerce and the plaintiff before the court has to be alleging treble damages based on that particular injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.083" offset="14520320">In... in light of these considerations, the Justice Department's position, the position of our allies, who have submitted amicus briefs, we submit that this decision is an error and it should be reversed and I thank the Court.</text>
