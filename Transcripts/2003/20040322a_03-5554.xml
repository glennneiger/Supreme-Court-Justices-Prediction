            <text syncTime="3428.610" offset="13714390">Truly if the officer is stopping Machine Gun Harry and he says, oh, I'm John Smith, and... and if you follow the government's position, then the officer at that time can relax his guard, thereby increasing the... the possibility of danger.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.597" offset="14050325">And the Court was very careful to suggest that there was a limited right, not a general exploratory search, that now we will be involved when... excuse me... because a name, the government suggests, will be the key to unlock data that is endless, given the modern age of technology, that the government can learn about that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.580" offset="14154292">It is a general exploratory search which the government ultimately is asking this Court to approve of.</text>

            <text syncTime="3597.202" offset="14388767">Well... well, with respect to the Terry stop itself, it is for investigation related to whether or not a crime may occur or is about to occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="3622.650" offset="14490540">But the... the notion that a person has to affirmatively provided a ticket to terminate that Terry encounter really tips the balance too much in favor of the State and risks a lot of benefits to our society that accrue through freely being able to move, to be let alone, to engage in protected activity without being subjected to the accosting that one is subjected to during a Terry stop.</text>
