            <text syncTime="1179.398" offset="4717505">Under Stillert... excuse me... Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal and Slack v. McDaniel, this Court has already made the determination that it has jurisdiction to consider and review a circuit court of appeals' decision pertaining to whether or not a first titled 2255 is second or successive following recharacterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.313" offset="4825234">Both of those cases dealt with that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.657" offset="4838609">They were different fact situations, but the bottom line was this Court took jurisdiction under those cases to consider the issue of successive or second petition under AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.744" offset="4890958">In addition, a... an actual look at the statute, 28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3)(E), which is in the appendix of the Government's brief, appendix 2a, that is the statute that the Government contends shows that this Court does not have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.129" offset="4992418">What that particular section deals with is a proscription against this Court having jurisdiction when a court of appeals has granted or denied a request for authorization for a district court to consider a second or successive petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.535" offset="5086041">That is a recognition on the part... the statute recognizes that there has been a first 2255 so characterized as such, so pleaded as such by the petitioner, and that he has then come before them with what he recognizes is a second motion, and he's going to the court of appeals and saying, under AEDPA there are restrictions that we have not had before, and I am required to come before you and meet certain gatekeeping requirements in order for the district court to hear my second or successive petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.023" offset="5252075">There is no first 2255 for a second... for... for the first titled 2255 to be successive to or to be second to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.141" offset="5308500">And therefore, section 2244(b)(3)(E) is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.790" offset="5335144">Now, the Government's argument in that regard is that because the Eleventh Circuit looked at the appeal and said, you don't meet the gatekeeping requirements, that that determination that it did not meet the gatekeeping requirements was a further sua sponte determination and recharacterization of his appeal into a request for certificate of authorization, and that therefore, under that scenario, 2244(b)(3)(E) should serve as a bar to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.831" offset="5495223">We strongly suggest, Your Honors, that that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.518" offset="5521972">The AEDPA and the... changed jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.048" offset="5552170">It... it limited this Court's jurisdiction to review very important habeas corpus... habeas petitions, and in so, it should be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.454" offset="5609744">The Government would have a further sua sponte recharacterization in this chain and prevent this Court from having jurisdiction to even hear the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.006" offset="7035925">The second instance... let me back up to try to answer that as clearly as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.836" offset="7055256">The ordinary case where a court of appeals is able to address the question whether the district court properly found that a motion was second or successive is a case where a motion for authorization to file the motion is filed in a court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.234" offset="7116904">That's because in many circuits, once a district court finds that a motion is second or successive, it's obligated to transfer the case to the court of appeals so it can make the gatekeeping determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.464" offset="7161835">And even in cases where a district court is permitted to dismiss and does rather than transfer, and once it's found that the motion is second or successive, it's going to be a rare case where the defendant is able to take an appeal from the dismissal because under this Court's decision in Slack v. McDaniel, he'll only be able to get a certificate of appealability if he makes two showings: first, that the procedural ruling that it was second or successive is subject to debate among reasonable jurists; and in addition to that, that there was some underlying constitutional claim that has arguable merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.984" offset="7295896">So in a rare circumstance, when an appeal can be taken on the issue of whether the motion is second or successive, and in the rare circumstance where the court of appeals, after affirming that finding, does not go on to reach the gatekeeping issue, as courts of appeals often do just to bring the case to a close, that will be the rare case where there has been a court of appeals' finding that the motion is second or successive, but yet no grant or denial such that 2244(b)(3)(E) does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.086" offset="8056268">We think that's the first textual indication that our position is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.718" offset="8070792">The second textual indication is that in 2244(b)(3)(A) and (b)(3)(B), Congress speaks of an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.062" offset="8120216">We think it's reasonable to view an order granting or denying an authorization to be synonymous with 2244(b)(3)(E)'s reference to a grant or denial of authorization.</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.126" offset="12004415">You know, we're not involved in recharacterization as a daily basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.417" offset="12021656">And moreover, we're not sure what rule to pick or what exact formulation, which will make a huge difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.786" offset="12043076">Now, the other approach is the First Circuit's approach, which is not the reason it commends itself to me, but I just put it out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.709" offset="12074736">And that is to say we interpret the words, second or successive petition, in AEDPA not to include this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.369" offset="12113398">You see, what they were talking about in Congress was not this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.993" offset="12131892">They didn't think a second or successive petition was second or successive where the first one took place under these no-warning circumstances before AEDPA was even enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.993" offset="12167941">Now, I think they come to exactly the same place, but that second approach, which they followed, doesn't get us into the business of writing rules in some kind of supervisory capacity in the dark.</text>
