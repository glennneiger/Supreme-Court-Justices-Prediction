            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 03-6539 Johnson against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.228" offset="28839">We granted certiorari in this case to review a decision of the Supreme Court of California interpreting Batson against Kentucky, a challenge as to jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.433" offset="65724">The case was briefed and argued but we now conclude that we are without jurisdiction in the matter because the opinion of the California Supreme Court was not final.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.798" offset="107102">We conclude this opinion in these words, "It behooves counsel for both petitioner and respondent to assure themselves that the decision for which review was sought is indeed a final judgment under Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.946" offset="163736">Such attention is mandated by our rules and will avoid the expenditure of resources of both counsel and of this Court on an abortive proceeding such as the present one."</text>
            <text syncTime="51.556" offset="206158">We dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.895" offset="215562">The Per Curiam opinion is unanimous.</text>
