            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="8.064" offset="32183">In a Texas Trial Court, the petitioner Delma Banks, Jr., was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.277" offset="65097">The prosecutor during pretrial proceedings told defense counsel that the State would provide all the discovery to which Banks was entitled despite that understanding, the State withheld evidence that would have allowed Banks to discredit two key prosecution witnesses by showing their links to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.367" offset="153391">One of the two witnesses, Robert Farr, testified at both the guilt and penalty phases of Banks’ trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.083" offset="184320">The State did not disclose to Banks that Farr was a paid police informant who had played a key role in the scenario leading to Banks’ indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.085" offset="228310">The prosecutor allowed Farr to testify untruthfully and without correction that he never spoke to any police officer about Banks’ case until a few days before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.014" offset="280033">Presenting the State’s penalty phase summation, the prosecution urged the jury to believe Farr calling his testimony open and honest, and of the utmost significance to the State’s plea for a capital sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.470" offset="333845">The other key witness, Charles Cook, testified only at the guilt phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.203" offset="352758">Cook had been coached intensively by prosecutors and law enforcement officers in preparation for his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.131" offset="384522">The transcript of a police-Cook interrogation revealed the coaching, but the prosecutor did not tell the defense that the transcript existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.528" offset="430080">To direct appeal and state postconviction review proceedings, the State left undisclosed the police links to prosecution witnesses Farr and Cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.614" offset="470413">When Banks alleged an State Court habeas petition that Farr was an informant, the State denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.468" offset="501864">The long suppressed evidence ultimately came to light through discovery and an evidentiary hearing ordered in a federal habeas proceeding, the Federal District Court granted Banks relief from the death penalty pointing to the State’s failure to disclose that witness Farr was a paid police informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.098" offset="576366">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.076" offset="592248">Banks did not qualify for federal relief from the death penalty, the Court of Appeals ruled, because he had not documented his claims of prosecutorial misconduct in State Court and was therefore barred from introducing evidence of the state office’s misconduct in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.855" offset="663406">The Fifth Circuit also denied Banks’ certificate of appealability on his claims that the prosecution had wrongfully withheld from the defense the transcript of the pretrial rehearsal of witness Cook.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.445" offset="717740">We reverse both Fifth Circuit’s rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.382" offset="729443">When police or prosecutors conceal significant, exculpatory, or impeaching material, we hold, it is ordinarily incumbent on the State to set the record straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.877" offset="779494">As to witness Farr’s informant status, it was Banks’ burden to show cause and prejudice to overcome his counsel's failure to produce evidence of police links to Farr in State Court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.468" offset="833829">Banks succeeded in demonstrating the requisite cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.199" offset="848771">He reasonably relied on the State’s representations made pretrial and repeated in state habeas proceedings that the prosecution had disclosed all relevant information.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.699" offset="894746">We reject the State’s contention that Banks nevertheless should have attempted to unearth the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.563" offset="922227">A rule declaring prosecutor may hide defendant must seek, is not tenable in a system constitutionally bound to accord a defendant’s due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.893" offset="967471">As to prejudice, Banks demonstrated reasonable probability of a different result in the penalty phase of the case had the jury known a prosecution witness Farr's, collaboration with the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.718" offset="1026821">Showing cause and prejudice to overcome his procedural default, today’s opinion explains Banks at the same time established the essential element of his claim, the prosecutorial misconduct infected the death penalty adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.790" offset="1087112">We also reverse the Fifth Circuit’s ruling on Banks’ claim of guilt phase prosecutorial misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.686" offset="1114697">A claim that rested on the State’s suppression of the transcript showing that witness Cook had been coached.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.679" offset="1142700">The Court of Appeals, we hold, should have issued the certificate of appealability on the question whether Banks should be deemed to have pleaded the Cook transcript claim given federal rule of Civil Procedure 15(b)’s provision for amendment of a party’s pleading to conform to the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.370" offset="1221381">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Scalia joined.</text>
