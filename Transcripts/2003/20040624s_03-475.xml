            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">The opinion of the Court in No. 03-475, Cheney against United States District Court for the District of Columbia will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="10.182" offset="40647">The plaintiffs who commenced this case in the United States District Court alleged that members of the presidential committee had failed to comply with the federal statute, the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.126" offset="88503">The common shorthand reference to that law is FACA.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.299" offset="109192">The Task Force in question was the National Energy Policy Development Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.172" offset="124656">Its chairman was Vice President Cheney.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.547" offset="134165">In a memorandum establishing the group, the President of the United States directed the Task Force to develop a National Energy Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.724" offset="166870">FACA requires advisory committees to comply with detailed procedural and disclosure requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.755" offset="186932">And the plaintiffs alleged that the Task Force was not in compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.061" offset="200202">The defendants pointed out that FACA exempts from its coverage, committees that are composed wholly or full-time or permanent part-time officers or employees of the Federal Government, and the named members of the group all did fall within this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.750" offset="254955">Now, the plaintiffs counted that despite its formal composition, the group have -- had included non-Government employees in its deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.975" offset="299886">And under this theory, the plaintiffs have said the exemption from FACA did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.186" offset="324650">Now, that -- those contingents were the main underlying issue in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.269" offset="345025">Then, the case became clouded with pretrial and procedural questions that give rise to our decision today.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.311" offset="369162">The precise dispute before us began as a discovery issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.892" offset="387553">The plaintiffs demanded information and documents about the group's meetings and deliberations and these plaintiffs are the respondents here in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.200" offset="424751">The Vice President and other defendants are the Petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.805" offset="435200">The Government representing the Vice President and his co-members on the committee took the position that the information requests were unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.914" offset="463621">Merely responding to the request, they said, in effect, would give the plaintiffs all the relief they sought on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.100" offset="484310">Furthermore, particularly in the case of the Vice President, it was argued that compliance with the discovery request was so burdensome and intrusive that this in itself would violate the principle of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.670" offset="530599">The District Court rejected the Government's objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.291" offset="541153">It ordered discovery and it denied the Government's motion to certify that ruling to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.420" offset="565603">The Vice President and the other defendants brought in action in the Court of Appeals seeking the writ of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.948" offset="587755">It asked that the District Court be directed to hold the discovery and dismiss the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.694" offset="606772">The Court of Appeals denied the mandamus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.436" offset="617744">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.948" offset="623700">We now vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.806" offset="639164">We reject respondent's preliminary argument that the mandamus position -- petition was jurisdictionally out of time under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4a.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.969" offset="675840">That rule by its plain terms applies only to the filing of a notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.595" offset="694335">It's inapplicable to the Government's mandamus petition under the All Writs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.756" offset="710949">Respondent's alternative argument that the mandamus petition was barred by the equitable doctrine of latches also lacks merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.265" offset="741042">The Government's active litigation posture following the District Court denial of the motion to dismiss was not a neglect or delay that would make application of latches appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.547" offset="782106">Now, with respect to the central issue in the case as it now comes to us, the Court of Appeals was incorrect to conclude that it had no authority to exercise the extraordinary remedy of mandamus under the -- on the ground that the Government protect -- could protect its rights by asserting executive privilege in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.502" offset="849920">With the Vice President not a party, the case might present different considerations, but the Vice President and his co-members on the Task Force are the subject of the discovery orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.846" offset="891298">The mandamus petition alleges that the discovery orders threaten substantial intrusions on the process by which those closest to the Government advising.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.317" offset="933198">These facts and allegation removed this case from the category of ordinary discovery orders where interlocutory review is unavailable through mandamus or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.595" offset="974367">The Court has held that a President's communications and activities encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material, than would be true of any ordinary individual and Chief Justice Marshall sitting as a trial judge recognized the unique position of the executive branch when he stated that in no case would a court be required to proceed against the President as against an ordinary individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.827" offset="1067259">This separation of powers consideration should inform a Court of Appeals evaluation of a mandamus petition involving the President or the Vice President.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.697" offset="1098710">Accepted mandamus standards are brought enough to allow Court of Appeals to prevent the lower court from interfering with a co-equal branch's ability to discharge its constitutional responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.470" offset="1141864">Respondents place heavy reliance on United States versus Nixon, the case that ordered the President to submit information in response to subpoenas in the criminal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.491" offset="1185959">Now, that case is not controlling here for various reasons that we discuss in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.746" offset="1206962">Among them is that there are no checks in the civil discovery process that are analogous to the constraints in the criminal subpoena context to filter out insubstantial legal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.829" offset="1247295">The narrow subpoena orders in Nixon also stand on a different footing from the unbounded discovery request in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.896" offset="1275507">We decline Petitioners' invitation to direct the Court of Appeals to issue the writ against the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.801" offset="1295151">This is not a case where having considered the issues, the Court of Appeals abused its discretion by failing to issue the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.450" offset="1317721">Instead, the Court of Appeals relying on its mistaken reading of Nixon terminated its inquiry without reaching the weighty separation-of-powers objections raised in the case, much less exercising its discretion to determine whether the writ of mandamus is appropriate under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.602" offset="1378325">We leave it to the Court of Appeals to address these -- these issues in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.827" offset="1399223">Justice Stevens has filed a concurrent opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.933" offset="1407687">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.154" offset="1428584">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Souter joins.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="362.840" offset="1451259">The Court today vacates the decision of the Court of Appeals that abided by the ordinary rules of appellate jurisdiction and under those rules did nothing wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.943" offset="1495771">I would affirm that Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.363" offset="1505384">The plaintiffs in this case Judicial Watch and Sierra Club alleged that private persons had served on an Energy Policy Advisory Group, in fact, if not informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.086" offset="1552300">Such participation, if it occurred, could subject the group to the disclosure requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.016" offset="1592007">The discovery plan advanced by the plaintiffs and initially authorized by the District Court, all agree, was exorbitant.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.826" offset="1627220">Was the overbreadth, of that initial authorization, a sufficient basis for an appellant court to stop the District Court in its tracks by issuing a writ of mandamus?</text>
            <text syncTime="422.299" offset="1689182">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.599" offset="1706318">I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.440" offset="1713737">Throughout these proceedings, the Government has insistently maintained that in deference to the executive's right to seek advice from any court, no discovery should be permitted in this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.915" offset="1771624">If that were so as a matter of law, there would have been at least an arguable basis for stopping the District Court midstream, well in advance of any final appealable judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.008" offset="1823974">The Court, however, does not address the question the Government tendered in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.959" offset="1851768">Indeed, the Court apparently rejects the Government's position that no discovery, whatever, is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.154" offset="1884578">Instead, the Court remands for consideration whether the discovery authorized by the District Court was too sweeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.933" offset="1919687">That intervention seems to me out of order.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.422" offset="1937659">In our federal judicial system, courts generally do not act on their own initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.635" offset="1966498">They await a party's motion or application.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.560" offset="1982171">In this case, the Government quite deliberately did not move for an order narrowing discovery and the District Court was under no obligation to issue such an order uninvited.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.448" offset="2041731">More than once, the District Court expressed its readiness to rein in discovery should the Government so move, but the Government made it plain that no discovery, not narrowed discovery, was its objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.084" offset="2104320">The Government moved not for reduced discovery but for a protective order relieving it of any obligation to respond to plaintiffs' discovery request.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.601" offset="2150400">When the District Court rejected the Government's plea for adjudication of the case, solely on the administrative record and supplemental affidavits and without discovery of any kind, the Government sought a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.929" offset="2215706">The Government asked the Court of Appeals to mandate that the District Court disallow any and all discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.291" offset="2245068">The Court of Appeals refused that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.550" offset="2258129">But should the Government so move, the Court of Appeals said, the District Court should indeed, narrow discovery to ensure that the plaintiffs obtain no more than they need to prove their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.813" offset="2323226">Mandamus, again all of us agree, is available only when no other adequate means to obtain relief is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.328" offset="2357290">If the problem was the overbreadth of the discovery, the District Court initially authorized as the Court of Appeals explained, a remedy was plainly in sight.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.346" offset="2405355">The Government could move the District Court to confine discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.903" offset="2423536">As the Court of Appeals suggested, discovery could be kept down to two issues, did persons other than federal officials participate in the Energy Policy Group, and if so, to what extent?</text>
            <text syncTime="620.861" offset="2483409">The Court of Appeals was fully aware, to use its own words, of the judiciary's responsibility to police the separation of powers in litigation involving the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.642" offset="2538475">It expressed confidence that if the Government were to move for an order narrowing discovery, the District Court, also mindful of separation of powers concerns, would grant such relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.673" offset="2590616">This Court has no force to disturb that judgment or to quote the Court of Appeals for insensitivity to separation of powers concerns that the Court of Appeals' opinion shows it had well in mind.</text>
