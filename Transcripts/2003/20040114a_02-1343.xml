            <text syncTime="199.467" offset="950233">Well, there are two answers to that, one that I was trying to answer before which is I don't think that this provision actually covers that particular situation because you don't need this provision in order to have authority as a local jurisdiction to make purchases on your own as to what you're going to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.206" offset="1009269">That's not, I don't think, a standard within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.178" offset="1021077">But second of all, I also don't think that the...  it must be unconstitutional in all respects as the controlling standard of law in this particular context either.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.177" offset="1057126">It is clear that there is a significant component of this...  of these fleet rules that is preempted, and perhaps all of them are preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.625" offset="1086905">But we were dismissed out at the earliest stages of these proceedings without an opportunity to demonstrate the metes and bounds of the regulations as they would particularly apply at this...  at...  at this particular juncture.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.215" offset="7085246">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.098" offset="7100815">The question in this case is whether section 209(a) of the Clean Air Act, which is reproduced at page 36a of our brief, preempts very modest fleet purchase rules which apply only to vehicles that are already commercially available, that is, that cannot have an effect on manufacture...  cannot require manufacturers to produce or sell anything, and which were adopted by a unique airshed in which 90 percent of all toxic air pollution derives from motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.083" offset="7248773">And the answer to that question is no because the text and the context of the Clean Air Act, title II of the Clean Air Act that deals with motor vehicles, show that Congress intended the word standard in section 209 to be used in the same way that it is used in section 202 and, indeed, throughout the entirety of title II...  title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.832" offset="7355771">It's used 100 times, I'm told by an amicus, in section 202 alone, and every single time that it is used there, it is used to refer to an obligation placed on manufacturers, that the vehicles they produce and sell meet specified emissions characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.175" offset="7441139">No one contends that that definition, the way the word is used in section 202, covers the rules in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.387" offset="7473949">Now, express preemption...  it requires discerning Congress' intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.589" offset="7494742">It's not an exercise in definitional possibilities, this Court has reminded us many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.873" offset="7515849">Now, you can read every brief from our opponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.300" offset="7529642">Every different brief offers up some other definition, and their briefs in related cases have done the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.161" offset="7553047">And we've heard no definition this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.473" offset="7562242">They look to the dictionary definition of standard or criteria or test, and they're reproduced in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.814" offset="7595679">But they...  they concede that there is no dictionary definition that they offer that coincides with the rule that they seek because they concede that Congress did not intend to cover incentive programs or tax programs even though, like purchase rules, they operate through the market on manufacturers and not directly on manufacturers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.178" offset="13877083">From the relevant perspective, that is the perspective of the manufacturer, they are the same, as Senator Levin and the EPA explained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.911" offset="14348019">Let me start with Justice O'Connor's hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.140" offset="14357005">We are told in language that I think a 6-year-old would have a hard time understanding that a flat ban on all gasoline-fueled engines in the State of California is not a standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.115" offset="14420848">Justice Kennedy is absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.140" offset="14428998">It has rendered the scope of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.573" offset="14438716">There is no field of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.226" offset="14445299">There is not even a divot of dirt of preemption that is created under that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.344" offset="14465779">It's not consistent with the language of the word standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.028" offset="14476541">Standard means more than what manufacturers do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.917" offset="14488035">It's not simply how it gets enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.487" offset="14494304">It's broader, and Justice Stevens is clearly correct in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.830" offset="14507679">The one provision that seems to have gotten lost in the...  in all of this, which I think is terribly important, is section 177 which states that State...  and this is at the...  the respondents' brief's appendix at 4a...  4a.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.583" offset="14558775">The States are not authorized to prohibit or limit directly or indirectly the manufacture or sale of a new motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine that is certified in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.895" offset="14604019">That is precisely what is being done here, is that vehicles that are certified in California are prohibited by a subagency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.902" offset="14635993">The State can't even do this, which is why I submit the answer to your question, Justice Scalia, is the State wouldn't have the authority to place the kind of restriction on its own subentities without running afoul of section 177.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.475" offset="14694298">And the only way California could get approval for that would be to go to the EPA in the way that Justice Breyer has already described.</text>
