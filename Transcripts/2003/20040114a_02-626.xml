            <text syncTime="1399.481" offset="5597832">First of all, EPA has never attempted to regulate water control facilities like the S-9 pump in the 30 years that the NPDES program has been in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.193" offset="5632731">And what's more, in cases, the closely analogous cases, of dams where water is simply being passed through a dam, EPA has taken the position that an NPDES permit is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.596" offset="5674318">Part of the reason for this is there are other regulatory programs that deal with these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.918" offset="5695634">Justice Breyer mentioned the problem of taking a polluted river and combining it with a pristine river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.196" offset="5720712">That actually implicates a number of different programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.729" offset="5730847">First of all, in the case of the polluted river, that river is subject to 402 requirements, and so there will be steps taken to prevent the discharge of pollutants into the polluted river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.518" offset="5777972">The States also are required, or at least strongly urged by the Government and with strong carrot and stick type incentives, to adopt non-point source pollution programs to reduce any non-point pollution that might be going into that polluted river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.173" offset="5836591">If there's an attempt to connect that river to another river, it does implicate, as Mr. Bishop indicated, the section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act which deals with regulations that result in the change in the flow of--</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.847" offset="12159373">However, if the Solicitor General's position were correct, St. Paul would no longer need that NPDES permit, and St. Cloud, substantially up-river on the Mississippi, would... would be under a... a review for does its discharges to the Mississippi, which have been found to meet the NPDES requirements, not changing the designated use or violating the Mississippi's water quality standard... it... its discharges should be deemed to be somehow removable artificially downstream in the Mississippi so that anyplace anyone at any time might construct the pipe and move them into a more pristine water body, you, St. Cloud now have to anticipate that and will be put under that... that mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.974" offset="12335856">So the inability of a permit writer to construct a 402 permit because he doesn't know that the evaluation is now to the receiving navigable water, but instead I have to evaluate where anyone with a pipe might move it, hundreds and hundreds of miles, without an NPDES permit, that permit writer essentially has to permit only for the highest designated use and the highest water quality standard anywhere in the United States, notwithstanding that where the discharge... point source is discharging to is a particular designated use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.953" offset="12487784">That would make the act either impossible to administer or place burdens on the governments that the petitioner says should not be placed on the governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.386" offset="12533447">Instead of placing it on the government that for some purpose, some economic purpose, is able to... to determine the costs and to... and to clean the water or at least subject itself to review, when it takes it from a navigable water into a pristine navigable water, you place the burden instead on anyone else who might discharge so... and... and whose... whose discharge might, if removed anywhere downstream by anyone for any reason, might end up causing a violation of a water quality standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.665" offset="13258606">But it's also possible, under those circumstances... and this is not our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.561" offset="13278145">Our case discharges at almost four times the water quality standard, 10 parts per billion, for the receiving water body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.620" offset="13306462">It clearly impairs the receiving water body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.168" offset="13320568">But if the standard for a water body were 20 of a substance, its actual receiving level was 10 and you discharged at 5, not to get too complex, but you're discharging at a lower level than the receiving water body and the water bodies are not impaired, it's possible mathematically, but not our case here... these hypotheticals should be left to another time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.386" offset="13413460">It's possible that the 1 gallon in the receiving water body that had 10, with 1 gallon added to it that had 5, the 2 gallons now have 15, or in fact, 7-and-a-half per receiving unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.546" offset="13462152">That may be determined by rule or other appropriate analysis in the western cases, if they ever come up, to not be an addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.751" offset="13498932">But that's not our case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.775" offset="13507082">The Court, in an abundance of caution, could point out that our case here is an artificial canal that receives substantial surface water runoff, itself probably a conveyance under the Clean Water Act definition of channels or discrete conveyances, that it discharges at levels up to four times the receiving water body's water quality standard, that it is itself an impaired water body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.982" offset="13595899">So that the hypothetical situations or application to western States or elsewhere is... are not being addressed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.330" offset="13625260">Now... now, the... the amici from the Tongue and Yellowstone River Irrigation District point out actually that in the west, they believe that ranchers and farmers will suffer from the Federal Government's unitary water theory because they will now be subject to water that is not of sufficient quality for their irrigation district and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.364" offset="13717420">It's not simply a west... and the State of Washington also joined in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.875" offset="13731422">We, of course... we don't count States, but more States support the tribe in their briefs saying this is essential than do support the... the district and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.624" offset="13766426">The... it's particularly important to recognize the C-11 was itself dug, is not a residual part of the Everglades, and that it's... the C-11 basin is not simply a... a water body divided from the WCA or the Everglades protection area by a levee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.339" offset="13853257">Looking at pages 6a and 7a of our brief, which are the appendix to our brief, are from the district's own web site, which it cited in its brief, and it shows the urban construction right to the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.887" offset="13903517">So it's not that the C-11 basin is water just divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.922" offset="13923683">It's an artificial canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.491" offset="13929953">It's no... no more part of the Everglades protection area than Fenway Park in Boston is part of the Charles River because it's built on the landfill where the Charles River once was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.439" offset="13969659">They're quite distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.297" offset="13977182">With respect to federalism issues, the Clean Water Act itself is a federalism instrument because it provides for the States to do the designation of uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.494" offset="14017933">It provides for the States to... to create the water quality standards, and it does protect the ability of the States to allocate quantities of water, but this is not a quantity allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.581" offset="14070282">The record shows clearly that the S-9 pump is turned on when you get to 1 foot of... turned off when... when the C-11 basin is at 1 foot and turned on when it's at 4 foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.750" offset="14122945">It is strictly a drainage mechanism to take surface water runoff and other water out of the C-11.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.522" offset="14150008">They're disposing of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.931" offset="14187624">It is the pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.129" offset="14192431">Whenever they say merely conveying water, we would say conveyance is defined as a point source and they convey pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.228" offset="14228898">If they didn't convey this massive amount of pollutants, we would not be before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.392" offset="14257528">The district, by pumping pollutants contained in the water against the natural flow of that water into the specially designated Everglades protection area, added that water to the Everglades protection area within the plain meaning of... of the Clean Water Act and within the common usage of... of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.767" offset="14346971">The district put those pollutants in the Everglades and nobody but the district put those pollutants in the Everglades.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.364" offset="14377378">An effort to reconstruct the term, addition to navigable waters, to allow them to dispose of those pollutants anywhere in the United States with a navigable water of any designated use or of any water quality standard would decimate the Clean Water Act's protection not only of the Everglades, but of the case law that... that Your Honors have had cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.967" offset="14475807">Now, the circuit court cases are not particularly precedent for your Court, but it does point out that Loon Pond would have had water that peeled paint off of the adjoining buildings put into it and not just through snow-making devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.262" offset="14544980">The... the court clearly indicated that sometimes the Pemigewassett water was put directly to Loon Pond to... to increase the amount of water in Loon Pond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.945" offset="14591687">Now, the... the United States would try to save its singular water theory in some cases by saying, well, water might be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.459" offset="14621780">They said on the Dubois case, the First Circuit Loon Pond, that it was removed for snow-making, but I point out that the court said in several places that it also went directly, never through snow-making devices.</text>
