            <text syncTime="54.036" offset="216085">The central question here is whether Atlas' post-filing change in citizenship should be allowed to create retroactive diversity jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.066" offset="256209">To justify rewriting the longstanding time of filing rule, Atlas relies on the fact that this case was tried to verdict before the jurisdictional issue was identified and raised in the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="77.442" offset="309708">When you found out that you had this fundamental jurisdictional objection, when did you know that the partnership included partners not only Texas entities but two Mexican citizens?</text>

            <text syncTime="94.903" offset="379611">There are two answers to your question, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.604" offset="390374">In terms of when we became aware of the issue, that was after verdict, and that's reflected in the affidavit which appears in the record at volume I, page 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.247" offset="428931">In terms of the question of was there evidence in the record that could have been pieced together to identify this issue earlier, the answer to that question is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.528" offset="470100">If... if... it probably could have been identified earlier, should have been identified earlier, but it was not.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.733" offset="506880">Dataflux at one point moved to add the Mexicans as individuals as counterdefendants.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="136.225" offset="544810">And why would it do that if they were members of the partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.229" offset="560901">If... if it was sure that they were members of the partnership, then you wouldn't need to make them defendants as individuals because partners have individual liability.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_boyce" startTime="151.253" stopTime="198.147">
            <label>Mr. William J. Boyce</label>
            <text syncTime="151.253" offset="604996">Two answers to that... that question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.853" offset="615340">First, under the Texas Revised Limited Partnership Act, the... the partnership can sue... the limited partnership can sue on its own without the participation of the limited partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.947" offset="663719">In terms of all of the counterclaims against Llamosa and Robles, again under the Texas statute, we can choose to sue the partnership itself or we can sue individual limited partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.124" offset="712411">In this circumstance, our counterclaim against them was predicated not on their status as limited partners, but rather on the fact that Mr. Llamosa and Mr. Robles made affirmative misrepresentations, was our position, directly to us to induce us to enter the contract that led to the... the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.526" offset="790047">So--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="198.147" offset="792555">But at that stage, you called them employees or former employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.245" offset="820976">So it seems that the... that you had some inkling.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_boyce" startTime="213.501" stopTime="247.105">
            <label>Mr. William J. Boyce</label>
            <text syncTime="213.501" offset="853995">--There... there was some confusion early on in terms of what exactly their status was and we, Dataflux, did not thoroughly explore that issue early on.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.473" offset="901851">And... and that should have been done earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.990" offset="911882">But I would also note that the bottom line here is that... is that Atlas, the party with unique knowledge of the exact circumstances of its partnership at the time of filing, is the party here who filed the case in Federal court at a time when there was not diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.034" offset="972069">There certainly could have been more that we should have done to explore the issue earlier.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="247.105" offset="988369">Well, you've admitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.135" offset="992444">You... you just admitted it flat out in your answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.799" offset="1011148">There were admissions that jurisdiction existed, but I would hasten to add that pursuant to the longstanding rule that jurisdiction cannot be stipulated to, agreed to, created by estoppel or waiver, that those statements are not effective to create jurisdiction if it does not exist at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.573" offset="1090247">And... and I would emphasize the language that was relied most recently in this Court's decision in Kontrick from January in which the Court noted that a court's subject matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to account for the parties' conduct during litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.888" offset="1151478">And I think that principle addresses that.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.746" offset="1158896">Is there more that could have been done to explore this earlier... this issue earlier and bring it up?</text>
            <text syncTime="295.773" offset="1183033">The answer to that question is yes, but I don't think that that circumstance undermines the fundamental rule here, which is that as of the time of filing, there was not a diversity present, and because of that--</text>

I noted in Caterpillar at page 11 that the Court cited the McMahan case from the Third Circuit in which there was a change in the partnership after the filing, but before the trial so as to empower the court with complete diversity and the court had the judicial power to decide the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.799" offset="9587148">I take it that if this Court in its unanimous opinion referred to the McMahan case, Knop v. McMahan, that it... it understood that change in that case and did not dispute the fact, therefore, that the change in a limited partnership is acceptable so that when that change occurs and then there is complete diversity and then there is a trial, that the court has the Article III judicial power to decide the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.579" offset="9734269">Or as... or as Justice Souter said in Lexicon, while not on all fours with this case by any means, there was no continuing defiance but merely untimely compliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.302" offset="10013153">The plaintiff took the option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.645" offset="10026527">While the case was on appeal, the appellate court gave the option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.482" offset="10041887">The plaintiff dismissed the dispensable party and the court said okay, we had jurisdiction then to render... the district court had jurisdiction then to render summary judgment in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.885" offset="10083474">The plaintiff could have turned down that power and said, no, I don't want to lose that dispensable party.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.356" offset="10121404">So you do have this Court in Newman-Green approving, if you will, the act of the plaintiff unilaterally to make the decision whether it's going to stay in Federal court or in that case... well, stay in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.120" offset="10196428">Here, there are... there are... the... the petitioner raises two salient issues: removal is different than remand and this was unilateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.630" offset="10246478">I've covered the unilateral in my opinion, and I will say one final thing about... subject to questions, about the removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.957" offset="10283781">And that is once a case comes to this court by removal or by direct filing, the jurisdictional questions are the same at that point, and that is, is there diversity?</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.011" offset="10331951">And in Caterpillar, it said, well, there wasn't and the court erroneously ruled, but later on diversity obtained and we had Article III jurisdictional power to try the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3346.599" offset="13386292">I would like to elaborate on an answer to Justice Breyer's question, which has been touched on by a number of the questions here, which is what's the worst that can happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.506" offset="13417953">And I... I think the point would be this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.766" offset="13467063">Jurisdiction can be created and jurisdiction can be destroyed by virtue of post-filing changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.044" offset="13492140">I mean, you... you could do that, but I mean, it's very clear to say it could destroy it; no.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.365" offset="13657443">If... if a court is going to make such a regime, surely it would make a sensible one and not one that's subject to abuse.</text>
