            <text syncTime="12.875" offset="51409">The court of appeals held that respondents could bring this suit under the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge the Bureau of Land Management's ongoing management of vast tracts of public land in Utah divorced from any specifically identifiable agency action that BLM had taken or that BLM was obligated to take but had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.289" offset="141061">The court of appeals relied on section 706(1) of the APA which authorizes a court to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.612" offset="182439">The court of appeals decision is contrary to the text of 706(1) which is limited to compelling agency action, not ongoing agency conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.801" offset="219115">It is contrary to the roots of 706(1) in mandamus, which has historically been limited to the performance... compelling the performance of what this Court termed in its seminal Kendall decision precise and definite acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.227" offset="276898">It is contrary to the APA's generally applicable limitation of judicial review to final agency action, not the sort of evaluation and planning activities at issue here.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="83.634" offset="334472">Certainly an action can be discrete and be compellable under old mandamus rules without being final agency action in the narrow... in the narrow sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.179" offset="404689">Let's assume a... a requirement under... under the statute that the agency promulgate its regulations by a certain date.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.903" offset="451605">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="113.838" offset="455262">Now, I... I'm... I'm not sure that that would constitute a failure... the... let's say these regulations are... are general plans of the sort that are at issue here so that they would not give rise to any immediate right of action in that they're not final agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.823" offset="563200">But if the statute says that the agency plan will be promulgated by a certain date, wouldn't there be a cause of action to require... you know, 6 months after that date the agency still hasn't come out with the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.573" offset="678243">Well, boy, I... I think you... I think you're out of the frying pan into the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.894" offset="695484">I... I think it's much more useful to the Government to... to say that... that a lawsuit can't be brought as soon as the plan is adopted, which it could if you call that final agency action, than it is to say that the failure to promulgate it can be... cannot be sued upon because the promulgation is not final agency action.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.842" offset="791301">--Just because something is final agency action doesn't mean it's ripe for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.211" offset="804780">And that... that's basically what this Court held in the Ohio Forestry case where it was a challenge to a comparable general land use plan that the Forest Service had promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.900" offset="843546">The plan itself was final agency action, but the Court said it was not ripe for judicial review because it did not have any immediate consequences on the behavior... behavior of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.958" offset="883775">But the court of appeals in this case allowed 706(1) to be used to compel certain conduct that is certainly not... probably not even agency action, but certainly not final agency action, for example, monitoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.182" offset="936647">Some of these plans contemplated that... that BLM personnel would... would go out and monitor various activities, not surprisingly in... in the vast tracts of land, and the court said that that could be compelled under 706(1).</text>

            <text syncTime="251.044" offset="1004147">Among other things, there's a claim that the land use plans for San Rafael Mountain and Henry Mountain require certain very specific things, that the land use plan, for instance, for one commits the Bureau of Land Management to finish an off-road vehicle designation rulemaking by 1992--</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.070" offset="13656189">It follows, we think, a fortiori under 706(1) that that cannot be done because 706(1) is essentially ancillary to 706(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.242" offset="13692865">It is designed to require the agency to disgorge final agency action if it has a legal obligation to do it so that once that final agency action is issued, it can be reviewed under the central provision of the APA, section 706(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.638" offset="13762456">706(1) is limited to compelling that sort of action and putting the courts in the position where they can then review final agency action in the way the Administrative Procedure Act contemplates, which is on the basis of the agency's decision, the agency's finding of fact, its application of law and policy to fact and its rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.051" offset="13844167">So this is not just a matter of form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.569" offset="13854198">We think that the difference between the lawsuit that plaintiffs have brought and the lawsuit that the APA contemplates is critical to the relationship between agencies and courts under the APA and under the separation of powers under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.727" offset="13906860">Plaintiffs' vision would put the courts in the position in the first instance of finding whether there's been compliance with the statutory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.483" offset="13933923">Our view and the way the APA requires is to submit a request for a particular order or regulation, let the agency act, and then review that discrete controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.922" offset="13975615">All three of the claims in this case that the plaintiffs have brought would reflect a radical departure from that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.826" offset="13999229">The first is to compel compliance with a general statutory standard to manage lands in a particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.996" offset="14023889">Management is not agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.865" offset="14035383">It's like a program, which this Court said in Lujan could not be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.769" offset="14055027">The claim to require NEPA statements is independent, not tied to any proposed major Federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.608" offset="14086374">They're claiming an ongoing duty to update NEPA programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.727" offset="14098808">And with respect to the land management program... plans, no court has ever held since FLPMA was enacted and these plans have been utilized that they impose on BLM a duty owed to members of the public to comply with schedules, tentative, anticipated schedules, as this document says, of what will be carried out in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.038" offset="14176131">This is not just a question of standing and zone of interest which private people might be able to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.525" offset="14198073">It's more fundamental than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.961" offset="14203820">These plans do not impose any duties owed to any member of the public because they are designed for internal management by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.900" offset="14239556">We are in no way saying that what BLM does is beyond judicial review, but the plaintiffs are required to follow the right procedures.</text>
