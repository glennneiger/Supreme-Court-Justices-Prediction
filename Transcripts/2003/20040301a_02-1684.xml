            <text syncTime="63.530" offset="254119">For nearly 4 decades, the ultimate inquiry as to whether a person is in custody is whether there is formal arrest or restraint in freedom of movement to the degree associated with formal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.841" offset="299363">The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the State court had identified the correct legal standard for determining custody, that no Supreme Court case had addressed whether age and experience needed to be considered for that determination, and that it was borrowing legal principles from another area of jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.130" offset="372506">Yet, it held that it was objectively unreasonable for the State court to have abstained from innovating such a new role.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.591" offset="406361">This case illustrates why Federal habeas relief cannot be granted under 28 U.S.C., section 2254(d), when a State court decision does not extend Supreme Court precedent to a new context.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.254" offset="461009">Such relief is incompatible with the provisions of section 2254(d) for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.737" offset="486922">First, to require a State court to extrapolate Supreme Court precedents from the voluntariness context to the custody context cannot be fairly characterized as applying this Court's custody precedents.</text>
