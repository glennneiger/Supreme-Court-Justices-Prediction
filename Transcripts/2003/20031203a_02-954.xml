            <text syncTime="10.857" offset="43363">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.846" offset="55380">In the course of their investigative work, Federal law enforcement officials, of necessity, routinely come into possession of substantial amounts of highly sensitive and highly personal information.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.121" offset="108460">Sometimes that information includes graphic death scene and autopsy photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.415" offset="133642">Those photographs are taken for the limited and restricted use of law enforcement and public safety officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.405" offset="165616">They are not freely available to the general public as a matter of law, custom, or practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.092" offset="192366">The question presented in this case is whether death scene photographs should be broadly disclosed to the general public under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.866" offset="235416">They should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.536" offset="242103">The Freedom of Information Act's purpose is not maximum disclosure, but responsible disclosure, and the publication of death scene photographs goes beyond the bounds of responsible disclosure, because in the terms of exemption 7(C), production could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of surviving family members.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.275" offset="345025">In ordering the release of four photographs in this case, the court of appeals recognized that that substantial intrusion on privacy would occur, but it then committed three errors in assessing the countervailing public interest in disclosure.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="101.591" offset="406361">Must there be identifiable family members to suffer this invasion of privacy?</text>
            <text syncTime="108.112" offset="432379">Would it just be automatic instead?</text>
            <text syncTime="110.729" offset="442828">The... a scene like this, you would assume that there was someone?</text>

            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Millett</label>
            <text syncTime="114.799" offset="459128">No, the... the practice of the Federal Government is that we need to identify the existence of a survivor.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.652" offset="486504">There was a case in the D.C.... excuse me... District Court, named Outlaw, that I believe was cited in respondent's brief, where the Department of Defense had asserted survivor privacy without having first identified a survivor, and that was held to be impermissible, and as a matter of practice, because this is sort of specialized application of privacy interest, the Government identifies a survivor before invoking it.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.544" offset="586083">But that is often not a difficult job because the types of records that bring the photos to us, law enforcement records, military records when it's a military service member who's been autopsied, will often contain, or allow the identification, of family members.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="162.725" offset="650867">And if you're so unfortunate as not to have survivors, or to have survivors who don't like you, the most embarrassing and gory photographs of your body can be released?</text>

            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Millett</label>
            <text syncTime="177.380" offset="709486">Well, Justice Scalia, that has been the practice after the Outlaw decision of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.210" offset="728816">It... it's not inconceivable to me that because you're talking about an objective test, at least under 7(C)... some of these photographs are held... upheld under... or withheld under exemption 6, which doesn't have the same objective test language.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.842" offset="779285">It's not inconceivable that the Government could justify withholding, in a situation like after the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, and their substantial amounts of... sorry, but, for the graphic nature... but partial remains that can't be matched with particular individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.651" offset="842501">But we know that for some significant percentage of those people, there are a significant percentage of survivors on a match for match.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.331" offset="873221">In that case, I think we would argue should not be required and that withholding could be done because we--</text>

            <text syncTime="228.817" offset="915226">I don't know why you... you can't say, and I think some courts have held, have they not, that... that there is a privacy interest in the... in the person who's died?</text>

            <text syncTime="237.295" offset="949081">--For the most part, courts have said that privacy dies with the individual, but again, the problem in this case is the Ninth Circuit didn't think we were withholding too little.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.432" offset="989727">It rule... it ruled that we were withholding too much that... and that, in fact, when there are known survivors, these... these disturbing photographs still have to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.546" offset="1030165">And in doing that, they committed three errors.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.313" offset="1041241">Before we get to that though, on the question that was asked, if there are no survivors, given that the main rule of FOIA is disclosed, unless you fall under an exemption, and exemptions are to be narrowly construed, I don't think the... the Government could suppose, could hypothesize an interest that may or may not have existed in the decedent when there are no survivors.</text>

            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Millett</label>
            <text syncTime="286.441" offset="1145731">Well, Justice Ginsburg, that has been the Government's practice, is to identify a survivor, but again, I think our position is, because the nature of our world has changed and we now have to deal with situations involving mass deaths, that we aren't going to insist when you have a large collection of remains and we know that for some percentage of those there... there are survivors, that withholding would still be permissible.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="310.962" offset="1243847">But why is that any less of a leap than saying the deceased... the deceased's privacy is being invaded?</text>
            <text syncTime="319.961" offset="1279791">Why is it less of a leap to say that the privacy... the privacy of the survivors is being invaded?</text>
            <text syncTime="326.210" offset="1304764">It doesn't seem to me that it's... it's their privacy that's being invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.499" offset="1317930">It's... it's their... their sensitivity, various other things, but... but it seems to me strange to speak of their having a privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.825" offset="1355233">Surely they have an interest in not having their... their... their relative displayed this way, but I... I wouldn't normally call that a privacy interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.825" offset="1391282">Well, Justice Scalia, the common law... a number of common law courts did, and they did... and we cite... one of the very first common law courts ever to recognize the right to privacy, in 1895, the Schuler v. Curtis case, which is cited in our reply brief, found exactly a privacy interest in the survivors, and it said it is not the privacy interest of the deceased, because under the common law tradition, privacy dies with the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.689" offset="1502668">But what's being protected here is the survivors.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.709" offset="1518759">It sort of takes three forms, first of all, their... their memory of the deceased, their ability to provide a dignified disposition of the body, and the ability to have seclusion in their grief and repose and closure.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.182" offset="1576647">And those concepts packaged together have been recognized as a privacy right, both at tort law by a number of courts, and more broadly, by custom and practice in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.410" offset="1621577">These types of photographs are not freely available virtually anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.119" offset="1640385">A large number of states, as we've cited in our brief, prevent their disclosure or have restrictions on their disclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="978.079" offset="3912307">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="995.540" offset="3982106">There are five basic reasons why the privacy interest at issue in this case should be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.349" offset="4009378">First, the Foster family seeks to protect their own, wholly legitimate privacy interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.030" offset="4040098">The privacy interests here of the family are to be free from seeing these photographs on television and in grocery store tabloids, to be free from the knowledge that these photographs are displayed in virtual perpetuity on ghoulish Web sites that show death and carnage, to be free from the harassment by the media that inevitably will follow if these photographs are released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.901" offset="4147513">Second, while FOIA privacy protection is broader, there is significant common law authority that a survivor's right of privacy is violated by showing photographs of deceased loved ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.216" offset="4208849">The Restatement of Torts recognizes this, so does Reid v. Pierce County, a 1998 decision by the Supreme Court of Washington, en banc, which allowed a cause of action for displaying the autopsy photographs of former Governor, Washington Governor, Dixie Lee Ray, at cocktail parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.764" offset="4295053">Third, every FOIA case that has examined the issue has found that in appropriate circumstances, survivors have a proper... a privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.364" offset="4341447">The Ninth Circuit and the D.C. Circuit did so in the cases involving these photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.225" offset="4364852">There is a 1987 opinion in the D.C. Circuit of Badhwar v. Air Force that does so regarding autopsy reports, and Justice Ginsburg joined in that opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.610" offset="4422426">We haven't heard anything about the other... the other half of the inquiry, and that is what the public interest is in... that might overcome that... that... that privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.718" offset="4474776">I'm sure the other side is going to... is going to talk about that, the... the alleged discrepancies in the reports and whatnot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.106" offset="4512392">Well, Justice Scalia, we think that there is no public interest on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.662" offset="4534648">We think as... as counsel for the Solicitor General has said, that there's a strong evidence test for showing that there is government... government misconduct where that is the allegation of the public interest, which is the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.471" offset="4597864">A... a number of courts have said that the test should be compelling evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.195" offset="4616777">The D.C. Circuit has done that in several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.894" offset="4631510">The Fourth Circuit has done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.296" offset="4637153">Other circuits have come to other standards in... in terms of what the public interest should be, but it must be something that is strong, that is not insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.237" offset="4680934">Secondly, in determining what the public interest is, the Court must be aware that there have been five investigations, five investigations of Mr. Foster's death, and all of them have found that he died by suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.470" offset="4741851">These investigations have released over 3,000 documents over--</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.421" offset="4761600">Yes, but it seems to me that the... arguably, the interest in disclosure might not challenge the ultimate conclusion, but rather they might contend... want to show that one of the team of investigators was totally incompetent, and it was necessary to have three or four other investigations to reach the correct result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.563" offset="4826175">I don't think the ultimate conclusion necessarily answers the... the claim that there may be some public interest in how the investigation was conducted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1228.770" offset="4914991">And here, where there have been five investigations, where the reports are voluminous, where the documents released and the photographs already released are voluminous, it is very difficult to see what the public interest is in getting these photographs, which would grossly invade the privacy of the family.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.276" offset="12493009">The Brandeis article was one of the six scholarly articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.354" offset="12505339">Now, keep in mind, the Brandeis article, 1890, was maybe the earliest trying to come up with a definition of privacy, so the language isn't as precise as what, for instance, former Solicitor General Fried came up with in his seminal 1996 article, also cited by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.329" offset="12569287">So I would say that the best definition that provides the clearest workable standard is the right to control information about yourself, and again, on the second point here, I... I won't go down the litany of things that are in the brief talking about how there was misconduct, at least negligence with regard to reporting this case, but once I've established that, which I have, I think that the Government can no longer be trusted to filter the raw evidence to the people in this case, and I don't see how in a democracy that depends on the integrity of its law enforcement agencies in a case where you've had... well, by the way, there haven't been five investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.509" offset="12742008">For instance, the Senate Whitewater Committee stated out the outset of its two-day hearings they're not looking into whether Mr. Foster committed suicide or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.161" offset="12784640">So we're also looking at a situation with regard to the Fiske and Starr offices using FBI agents as part of their investigation, where the FBI did the initial investigation with the Park Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.088" offset="12832287">That's all in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.574" offset="12838243">There's a conflict of interest there when you have FBI agents participating in an examination of what they already did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.633" offset="12866456">So to call this five separate investigations is highly misleading, and I think that the only investigation that will matter in this case is the one that the people can do directly by seeing the raw evidence for itself, because for whatever reason, and I don't impugn the motives of Judge Starr or anybody else, I have no personal knowledge that he actually wrote the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.257" offset="12956944">He had lawyers in his office.</text>

November 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.500" offset="13733930">You won't need to go to findadeath dot com.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.358" offset="13741349">You can go to departmentofdefense dot gov to find pictures of... the 50 pictures that are routinely taken during autopsies of military office... officials killed overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.843" offset="13783353">Justice Kennedy, you had asked about the remand, whether a remand was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.159" offset="13808536">It is not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.017" offset="13816059">On pages 56A through 59A of the petition appendix, the district court, before being redirected by the court of appeals, we think erroneously, ruled that the... the pictures should be withheld applying a less demanding standard than the one that we approached, that it just balanced the allegations of misconduct against the privacy interest, and concluded that the privacy interest still outweighed, assuming that... that just allegations count for something on the public interest side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.426" offset="13925669">So if this Court agrees with the Government's position or requires anything more than allegations of misconduct, there'll be no need to remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.682" offset="13958687">It's also not a discretionary decision, it's a de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.565" offset="13974256">The balancing is undertaken in the first instance, but it's reviewed de novo by the court of appeals and de novo by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.342" offset="13997349">Justice Scalia, you talked about this doesn't sound like privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.553" offset="14022113">Well, privacy is a language that has been used by not all, but a number of common law courts that are cited in our opening and reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.627" offset="14054504">And this Court's interpretation of the concept of privacy under the Freedom of Information Act has gone far beyond what tort law would protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.543" offset="14090136">There... I don't know that there's any court case that would suggest that rap sheets should be public records, like rap sheets would be protected under privacy conceptions in common law, so it would be extraordinary in this case to decide that the language Congress employed, personal privacy, is intended to be interpreted more narrowly than it has, at least at some... at some courts at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.213" offset="14176758">Justice Scalia, you also asked about narrowly construing the exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.869" offset="14199432">It's... I agree that there are cases that say that, but in John Doe Agency v. a John Doe Corporation, this Court made clear that these exemptions still have to be interpreted in a way that allows their exempt... the purposes of the exemptions to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.441" offset="14257737">And in a... and they should not be construed in the non-functional manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.073" offset="14272261">If law enforcement is to become the instrument... in the eyes of the public, the law enforcement, the Federal Government, will be the instrument of these types of disclosures and causing this type of pain to families that is likely to have a chilling effect on people's willingness to provide information to law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.846" offset="14351360">You asked about other statutes, and we discussed the Privacy Act statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.253" offset="14372989">The Privacy Act statute doesn't apply to survivors, but that's because the language is specifically different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.281" offset="14397022">The Privacy Act talks about... defines the... the records that are covered in terms of information about an individual and information that... to that pertains to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.079" offset="14448222">It has a sort of very... and it has to be information contained in a system of records that... where information can be retrieved by an individual identifier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.457" offset="14481763">It's a very narrow and specialized definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.232" offset="14488869">It's exactly the type of definition that Congress would have used if it wanted a more narrow approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.062" offset="14508199">Thank you.</text>
