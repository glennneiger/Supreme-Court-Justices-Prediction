            <text syncTime="90.158" offset="360594">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="93.251" offset="372924">28 U.S.C., section 1782 authorizes discovery for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal, upon application by an interested person.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.938" offset="435722">Those are words of indeterminate scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.449" offset="449724">No one in this case contends that they should be applied to the limits of definitional possibility, that words like interested person, for use in, proceeding require a contextual interpretation, and the context in this case is comity in discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.541" offset="534152">As... in language that everyone in this case quotes, the 1964 Senate report characterized the statute as for the purpose of, quote, adjusting U.S. procedures to the requirements of foreign practice and procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.465" offset="601757">And with respect to the question presented in this case, there are three salient, completely undisputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.382" offset="637492">Number one, EC law denies an antitrust complainant any discovery rights for anything at any stage of the proceeding however long or short it may go.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.954" offset="695798">Number two, if AMD had filed its complaint with the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department or the FTC, it would likewise have no discovery rights whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.072" offset="752222">And third, the EC, which can obtain these documents directly from Intel, has not only declined to do so in this case, but has unequivocally represented to this Court that permitting parties that file complaints with it, thereby to invoke section 1782, will interfere with its governmental functions.</text>

I'm confident that our successive briefs in this case provide a number of hooks, but I'm going to give you one or two that I think are particularly applicable with respect to textual interpretation, although obviously we also would urge the Court, because this is a procedural statute, not one that grants substantive rights, that it can and must announce general rules of supervisory power that outline where a... where discretion ends and abuse begins because another operative word in the statute is may.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.548" offset="1118145">But since we're talking with text, let's look, for example, at the word, interested person.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.288" offset="1141133">The innovation of the statute is it said, okay, you can grant discovery either pursuant to a letter rogatory, et cetera, et cetera, which is the ordinary way in which international discovery is invoked by foreign tribunals or foreign sovereigns, or by an interested person.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.017" offset="1220023">Now, no one in this case says that interested person should be given its plain meaning, otherwise we would have essentially a universal private freedom of information act.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.931" offset="1471634">Your first two points puzzle me because there is no counterpart in European schemes to our out-of-court discovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.562" offset="1594201">You don't have a complainant who has a right before that commission to submit evidence, to be present at their... if they... if they do have a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.259" offset="1741009">But the context of this statute is discovery, and the purpose, as made pellucidly clear, is to reduce the significance of international boundaries in discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.859" offset="1787402">And therefore, what we say, with respect, is you should read interested person to mean an entity that has at least some discovery rights to something at some stage of the process, whether it's pending or imminent or reasonably foreseeable.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.518" offset="1898057">Another purpose of the statute was the imperial export of, quote, liberal American discovery rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.660" offset="1926583">Now, we think that's wrong, but even if it were right, it would be unavailing in this case because it is undisputed that if they had filed a complaint with any of the antitrust regulatory authorities here, they would be entitled to no discovery whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.031" offset="2000039">And therefore, at least you ought to interpret interested person to mean a private entity that has no discovery rights whatsoever either in the foreign proceeding or would have it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.207" offset="2048731">I mean, the very premise of, quote, liberal American discovery is that it is available when a private party undertakes the obligations of being a litigant.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.074" offset="2212258">The court has to authorize it, and the order for discovery will come not from a subpoena that you sent as a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.133" offset="2240470">It's just... they don't... so if we were to interpret it your way, then you would say, well, that no private party in a civil law system that doesn't know from pretrial discovery, doesn't have anything like pretrial discovery, could never get any documents, could never get any testimony.</text>

I mean, I think this Court ought to announce that since the manifest purpose of the statute is to assist, quote, foreign tribunals and litigants before those tribunals, that the indeterminate words of the statute should be read in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.107" offset="2376411">But even if you wanted to say that discovery would be available at least on a discretionary basis, to someone who has some discovery rights somewhere, if they were to file this type of action in some place, that would also be useful to the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.569" offset="2446211">And there... it is simply irrational to say that a statute that was enacted in order to reduce the significance of international boundaries would create this giant loophole that creates ubiquitously universally unavailable discovery, just because somebody has... happens to bring an administrative complaint in one country and seeks to receive documents that are available in this country when he or she couldn't have received them if he had sued here and where the foreign, quote, tribunal has stated as a categorical matter that resort to section 1782 by complainants before it will affirmatively undermine its sovereign governmental processes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.041" offset="4576131">And we know from the briefs that AMD has a pretty good idea what that information entails and therefore would be in a perfectly adequate position to go first, obviously, to the commission and say this is why we want you to consider this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.037" offset="4632137">And then second, in the event that we were to issue a refusal to go forward with the proceeding, which we have to explain, frankly, in quite excruciating detail, that's then subject to very much plenary review by the court of first instance and ultimately the Court of Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.736" offset="6722873">And, therefore, it is terribly important that this Court announce a rule, either as a supervisory matter or as a matter of statutory construction, that will limit the ability of the commission to be used, as I say, as a pawn in this discovery effort.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.210" offset="6964767">Those concerns deserve respect, but emasculating section 1782 is not the proper way to respect those concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.098" offset="7048359">As to the second question, whether or not this is a proceeding before a tribunal, which seems to be the heart of this case, when Congress enacted or amended section 1782 in 1965, it is absolutely clear that Congress intended to extend the rights granted under section 1782 to proceedings in foreign countries that were quasi-judicial and administrative in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.962" offset="7159745">And it is also quite clear that Congress did not know and did not consider it necessary to know all the different shapes and forms that administrative law might take in other jurisdictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.322" offset="14265260">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.634" offset="14274456">The brief, amicus curiae of the European Commission, states that what it wants is reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.413" offset="14297652">It wants reversal of the decision that sent this back for a discretionary, 1 of 800 judges' factor-by-factor balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.669" offset="14330671">Now, everybody considers... Justice Souter, with respect to your question about how difficult it might be to determine foreign discoverability, everybody agrees that's a relevant factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.072" offset="14372258">So the question is going to come up in even more instances if you don't announce a rule, either by construing interested person or proceeding or for use in, that somehow channels the discretion of district judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.758" offset="14434952">Justice Kennedy, pages 36 and 37 and particularly footnote 18 of our blue brief provide, we think, the authority for instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.367" offset="14477375">But it's basically saying the way you do when you decide cases involving discovery under rule 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.189" offset="14500676">There are certain instances in which, since we know what the statute... there's no doubt about the purpose of the statute, it will always be an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.477" offset="14537874">Now, with respect to the question of whether this is isn't a tribunal or how soon a tribunal has to occur, AMD acquiesced, and this is a point made in footnote 2 of our reply brief on page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.050" offset="14596180">They acquiesced... and this Court granted cert on the second question presented... on the assumption, as the lower court found, that there is no proceeding before a tribunal now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.028" offset="14640065">Otherwise, the question of whether the D.C. Circuit's interpretation of how soon it had to be or the Second Circuit's interpretation would have been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.045" offset="14676114">Similarly, this morning is the first time that... that AMD has argued that it was in... that it is, in fact, a litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.521" offset="14714044">It has always argued that you shouldn't read the interested person to require litigant even in the private context because it's only in the title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.695" offset="14746749">It's only showered throughout the legislative history, but it's not in the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.691" offset="14766707">But the question of when something is a tribunal or when it isn't may determine, as this Court's questions this morning suggest, lots of very, very fact-specific determinations that have to be examined perhaps on a case-by-case basis, although we would argue that where the, quote, tribunal itself says we're not, a court ought to accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.915" offset="14855628">But if you simply interpret interested person or interpret for use in in the context of a request by a private party before there is any proceeding, that where the request is by an entity that has no rights of discovery at all, not to documents, not to testimony, not at the first stage, not at the second stage, and not in any subsequent judicial proceeding, we can simply cut this off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.592" offset="14986344">It will always be abuse of discretion to come to the United States and try and get discovery when you're trying to aid a tribunal that doesn't now and never will allow you to get any discovery.</text>
