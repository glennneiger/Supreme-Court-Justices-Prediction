            <text syncTime="297.092" offset="1188362">And the Eleventh Circuit judgment, Justice Scalia, is actually one that says once the petitioner is scheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter whether it's a conditions of confinement suit as you described, that the Federal courts somehow have no authority to grant relief or conduct review because the execution... the scheduling of the execution somehow divests those courts of jurisdiction.</text>
