            <text syncTime="87.845" offset="351295">Historically present value has been an objective concept equalling the real interest rate and inflation, which is the time value of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.283" offset="413048">The Seventh Circuit has redefined this concept in a manner that seriously disrupts two fundamental principles of chapter 13, that being the equal treatment of creditors similarly situated and the debtor's rehabilitation, the debtor's access to chapter 13.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.812" offset="659226">It's not particular to a specific creditor because you're just trying to equate the amount of money over time to a particular amount of the allowed secured claim.</text>

I thought that the coerced loan approach, which you object to, did have certain deficiencies, because you had to have testimony what the interest rate is, you have to conform it to the particular transaction, it's hard to administer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1142.517" offset="4569966">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.604" offset="4622315">The court of appeals here held that the bankruptcy courts are required to presume that the pre-bankruptcy contract rate of interest, which varies from creditor to creditor and could range anywhere from 0 to 40 percent or more in some jurisdictions, is the appropriate discount rate to use in calculating the present value of plan payments under section 1325.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.096" offset="4696294">Now, that approach is mistaken, we submit, for three principal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.645" offset="4710504">First, it violates the core bankruptcy principle of equality of distribution for similarly situated creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.954" offset="4739762">Under the court of appeals' approach, two creditors could make car loans to the same debtor that resulted in allowed secured claims of equal value, and yet one would receive thousands more in plan payments solely because the other made its car loan at a time when the debtor's financial troubles had not yet become obvious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.956" offset="4863791">Your Honor, this is an important point because I think there is some misconception about what the court of appeals held in this case, and I think that's due in part to the fact that respondents, at least as I read their position, are not really defending the approach taken by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.536" offset="4918126">The court of appeals did not adopt a presumption in favor of the pre-bankruptcy contract rate because it thought that that represented accurately the relevant market, if you will, for the risks of...  and benefits and protections that exist under the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.927" offset="4971624">In fact, under the court of appeals' approach, the risk of nonpayment is really irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.074" offset="4992209">What the court of appeals says is that because the...  the creditor is denied use of funds for the period of the payment plan, that it therefore is entitled to whatever rate it would have gone out and funded a new loan at if it had been allowed to foreclose and reinvest the proceeds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.181" offset="11148643">The best test for what it's worth would be what the market says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.557" offset="11166198">Now, the problem is, is that in chapter 11 there is a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.250" offset="11180931">People do lend to chapter 11 debtors, and the standard is the same in chapter 11 as 13: value as of the effective date of the plan under 1129</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.581" offset="11210292">So what we...  we have to be very careful about is in chapter 11, the markets do value debtors' promises to pay and they lend money and they charge very high interest rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.073" offset="11248222">Exit lenders or finance lenders charge very high interest rates, 18, 19, 20 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.820" offset="11267239">It can't be true that in bankruptcy, in chapter 13, where the riskiest chapter...  riskiest debtors with the highest default rate, that we systematically give them a rate which approaches prime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.573" offset="13010233">But the debtor has no money at all and certainly you don't want the debtor's money eaten up hiring an attorney and further depleting the money that could go to the creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.895" offset="13247530">If the debtor doesn't like that, we'll offer less of a rate and then what happens is a negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.353" offset="13265398">And the debtor and the secured party get together and they negotiate based upon the debtor's presentation of this is why I think it should be adjusted off of that because my circumstances have improved or there's a lot of equity in this particular collateral, so your risks are less, so you're more protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.616" offset="13330390">And those various reasons can then be given, and then the parties can negotiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.158" offset="13348571">If, however, you set a standard where the bankruptcy court is just simply going to decide based upon the evidence that the parties put in, we're not going to adopt the formula approach, then you'll be back to the problem where we are before, lots of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.508" offset="13394024">Again, because the contract rate is the best evidence of a...  of a market rate between these parties, it should be the presumptive rate and we should work from that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.842" offset="14143321">The debtor makes payments to the chapter 13 trustee as a dispersing agent, and the chapter 13 trustee then distributes the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.272" offset="14172996">What you're doing here is you're reallocating in this case a few hundred dollars away from unsecured creditors toward the secured creditor because, again, the statute says the secured creditor is not required to take...  shoulder uncompensated risk for the benefit of anybody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3608.788" offset="14435056">First of all, we need to get back to the concept of present value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.596" offset="14462328">Present value is the time value of money, which is the real rate of interest plus inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.953" offset="14495765">The record in this case shows that the real rate of interest was 2-and-one-half percent, and inflation was 3-and-one-half percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.398" offset="14529515">Now, in this case, the debtors made all the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.433" offset="14549682">They actually paid the contract off early, but we need to start with as pure a base as possible and then if there are special circumstances, sure, the bankruptcy court could have discretion to add on if there is particular jeopardy to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.807" offset="14639125">But we're measuring two different things here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.286" offset="14649051">The...  the statute doesn't say contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.720" offset="14658873">The statute doesn't say market rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.942" offset="14671726">This market rate concept has been misabused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.772" offset="14691056">And it...  right now under the bankruptcy court's interpretation anything is okay as long as you put this market rate label on it, and that's not a proper standard for chapter 13 confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.126" offset="14752496">The other problem is with the respondent's approach, the respondent uses words out of the Bankruptcy Act, pre-Bankruptcy Act, that simply were never enacted under chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.528" offset="14830028">Full compensation, full value of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.274" offset="14849045">That's nowhere in chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.504" offset="14857927">It's not a part of the chapter 13 requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.930" offset="14871719">Indubitable equivalence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.583" offset="14878302">That's not a chapter 13 confirmation concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.875" offset="14895438">That's a...  that's a concept that was brought in to confuse this issue, but it is not chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.843" offset="14927308">Respondents...  their amicus said that under their interpretation of the statute, basically anything goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.707" offset="14966805">A rate from 100 percent to 300 percent would be just fine with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.023" offset="14992091">Congress has not chosen to protect subprime creditors.</text>
