            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 02-1609, the City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.545" offset="34168">Mr. Nathan.</text>

            <text syncTime="9.371" offset="37407">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.655" offset="58619">This case presents the narrow issue of the judicial review appropriate for a license denial under Littleton's ordinance where clear, objective standards guide the city's quick and guaranteed decision to grant or deny a license and render that decision subject to effective review in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.551" offset="138136">As FW/PBS has made clear, none of the three risks the Court has articulated to justify the extraordinary remedy of a mandated judicial deadline exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.575" offset="182230">Those risks are: the government will err in line-drawing between protected and unprotected speech; self-censorship stemming from a censored decision that speech is not protected; and foot-dragging when the government is the plaintiff seeking to vindicate its decision to censor.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.842" offset="263314">Instead, where the decision to grant or deny a license for expressive activity is bounded by valid time, place, and manner considerations, this Court has held that certiorari review is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.731" offset="310857">That is because the alleged risk here that the city clerk will violate the ordinance when it requires a granting of a license is not a risk that flows from the language of the licensing standards at all, but rather a refusal to apply those objective standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.532" offset="378044">In short--</text>

            <text syncTime="109.947" offset="439693">These were in the old days when they had censure boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.615" offset="450456">So there was a great impetus to have quick action.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.832" offset="471249">But here, I take it that the business was up and running and it was the city that said you need a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.111" offset="504372">And my question is, do these questions... does the business start first and the city come in and say you need a license, or do... does the entrepreneur wait until... and... and apply for a license before starting up in business?</text>

            <text syncTime="146.152" offset="584516">The entrepreneur would apply for a license and, assuming it is granted, would then start the business.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.363" offset="961411">First, it would allow the secondary effects that the licensing ordinance seeks to prevent while the provisional license is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.991" offset="995892">And second, it would allow the business to drag its feet in court, whereas a business that needs a license has every incentive to pursue that.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="259.560" offset="1038211">Well, if... if there's a danger of delay in litigation that... that both parties fear... and apparently you feared... isn't that all the more reason that before you have a license which restricts the publication of allegedly lawful speech, that you should have a... a system for prompt judicial determination?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Andrew Nathan</label>
            <text syncTime="282.595" offset="1130371">But where you have an ordinance, Your Honor, that does not deal directly with speech, has separate objective licensing standards that do not have anything to do with speech, the government does not bear the burden of going to court first.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.375" offset="1205499">But more importantly, the court should be able to determine if... readily from a record that's created by the administrative process as to whether or not the decision to deny the license is a subterfuge to deny speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.989" offset="1271954">And in that case, what happens is... is that a mandated judicial remedy would require courts to determine even those cases where the business is not claiming that there's a First Amendment reason for the denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.729" offset="1338828">They're just claiming that the denial is incorrect.</text>

I... you could... if we're sitting here drafting a model ordinance, which is of course part of the problem that I'm presented with so far as the respondents are concerned, but if you're... if we're trying to envisage a model ordinance, just account for that contingency, saying our prompt judicial determination procedure applies only if there's a First Amendment claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.470" offset="4441861">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.130" offset="4480418">It is neither necessary nor appropriate to require licensing schemes like Littleton's to provide prompt judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.611" offset="4506436">It's not necessary because, as this Court's cases demonstrate, the type of judicial review required in licensing schemes must be correlated to the First Amendment concerns that the ordinances present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.659" offset="4546560">The First Amendment risks here are far less than the risks of freewheeling censorship that were at issue in Freedman and its progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.587" offset="4570279">The ordinance here does not license speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.187" offset="4580728">It licenses businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.552" offset="4586162">Thus, prompt access is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.864" offset="4595357">In fact, it would be inappropriate to impose a judicial deadline requirement for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.898" offset="4615523">First, it would impede State and local efforts to control secondary effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.894" offset="4635481">Second, it would offend notions of comity and federalism by assuming that State judges will ignore their constitutional obligations to be sensitive to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.901" offset="4667559">And finally, it would require local officials to impose time limits on those over whom they have no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.435" offset="4689711">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.589" offset="4694309">Thus, both constitutionally and jurisprudentially, prompt access to meaningful review is all that the Constitution requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.647" offset="4722521">The Freedman decision was motivated by two concerns, neither of which is present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.470" offset="4745822">There's neither the... the problem of unbridled discretion, nor a risk of self-censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.754" offset="4766929">Unbridled discretion occurs only in two situations where you have either the possibility of administrative delay or standardless discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.049" offset="4800157">And as this Court has recognized in a number of cases, the latter, standardless discretion, presents unique challenges for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.291" offset="4829100">It makes sense in that context to require some type of judicial deadline because essentially meaningful judicial review on an expedited basis is impossible if there's no standard to give any indication as to why the administrative decision was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.666" offset="5062635">Here the court... or I'm sorry... the city waived any abstention argument in order to allow the 1983 case to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.353" offset="5089384">Potentially it could have, notwithstanding the abstention argument, but of course, there would be the issue of abstention which is one reason why prompt access to some type of State remedy is so important in... in the case if 1983 is not an effective vehicle.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1286.554" offset="5146122">Of course, I guess we'd have to have either a statute, such as the statute that requires Federal district courts to expedite criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.957" offset="5187814">I'm not sure a Federal district court can both take the case and also bump it up to the top of its docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.759" offset="5218952">Can they do that, leaving... leaving behind people who have been waiting several years to be heard?</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.641" offset="5234521">I don't know that that will work without a Federal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.120" offset="5244447">Well, and I guess at... at core, it doesn't matter whether you go to the Federal court under 1983 or to State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.088" offset="5276317">Presumably the sensitivity of the judge to the First Amendment concerns in both cases would be the same and their willingness to move it to the front of the docket would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.261" offset="5309022">We look... I mean, this Court has definitely in the past shown that where State courts are not sufficiently sensitive to First Amendment concerns, for instance, in the Skokie case, the Court demonstrated that it could fashion tools to handle what it felt was undue delay in the court system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.895" offset="5447576">But... but the point is as long as you have prompt access, you're going to get access to a judicial official who is going to be sensitive to First Amendment concerns and, if necessary, has all the traditional tools of equity available to provide immediate relief, TRO's, PI's.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.123" offset="5616431">So by having a clear exit, as well as a... a vehicle that's either prescribed by rule or by statute so everybody knows the appropriate vehicle and there aren't any questions about the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter, as well as a record that... that they can use to make a... a prompt review when it gets before them, we would contend that that meets what this Court was talking about with respect to the second prong in FW/PBS.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.942" offset="13435716">And if... if we take it back to Freedman, you read Freedman and Freedman does... did provide a right of access, a right of appeal and talked about judicial review interchangeably with prompt judicial determination, disposition, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.854" offset="13491409">Now, without an actual judicial disposition, the administrative officials will have the power to shut down an entire business, not simply a single work of art, but it will be an entire business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.523" offset="13722018">And that is essentially the default position of any trial court.</text>
