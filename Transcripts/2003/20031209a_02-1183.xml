            <text syncTime="9.825" offset="39288">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.982" offset="51827">Before this Court's decision in Dickerson v. United States in the year 2000, it was the uniform rule in the lower Federal courts that the failure to issue Miranda warnings meant that the unwarned statement was not admissible in the Government's case, but that there was no requirement to suppress physical evidence that was derived from those unwarned statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.895" offset="151510">Following this Court's decision in Dickerson, which affirmed that Miranda has constitutional stature, the majority of the Federal courts of appeals to address the issue continued to adhere to the pre-Dickerson rule that physical fruits of an unwarned statement were admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.728" offset="222877">In this case, the Tenth Circuit broke ranks with that uniform body of authority and held that, as a result of Dickerson's ruling that Miranda has constitutional stature, there is a derivative fruits suppression component to the Miranda rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.205" offset="292780">That holding should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.161" offset="304588">Miranda stands as a rule that implements the Fifth Amendment, not by requiring the compulsion that the Amendment literally speaks of, but by providing an extra level of protection for the core of the Fifth Amendment right, the right for the defendant's own statements that are incriminating not to be used against him in a criminal trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.279" offset="469055">So it is...  there is obviously some provision of the Constitution that enabled us to disregard that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.467" offset="609802">And to provide an extra layer of protection to avoid the violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, the Court adopted a prophylactic warnings and wavier procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.595" offset="830380">What we're talking about in this case is not a substantive violation of the defendant's rights, but a procedural violation of the Fifth Amendment that this Court has defined in Miranda, but has defined it in a way that is highly distinct from the basic, textually-mandated rule of the Fifth Amendment that compelled statements may not be used.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.122" offset="1032464">What Miranda addressed was a situation in which it was extremely difficult for the courts to sort out whether a statement was coerced or not coerced, and to avoid the risk that an actually coerced statement would be used in evidence against the defendant, thus violating the core Fifth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.018" offset="1111980">The Miranda Court, as this Court has later explained, adopted a presumption, a presumption for a limited purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.362" offset="1609352">The rule, at the time of Miranda and today, is that if there is actual compulsion, the Government may not make use of the actual statements that are taken or their evidentiary fruits.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.249" offset="1872980">But this Court has recognized, in allowing the use of unwarned statements for impeachment and in adopting the public safety exception, and in permitting a second warned statement, as the Court did in Oregon v. Elstad, to be admitted into evidence, notwithstanding an earlier unwarned statement, that there is a difference between the Miranda presumption and a finding of actual compulsion.</text>

Quarles, that when pressing public safety needs justify the conduct of custodial interrogation without prior issuance of Miranda warnings, that situation falls outside of the Miranda paradigm, and the statements themselves can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.145" offset="2184568">Now, Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion argued that there should be no exception for public safety for the statements themselves, but the gun, as derivative evidence, should come in, because it was not the product of actual compulsion at which the Fifth Amendment is aimed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.163" offset="13376575">Miranda is a rule that is perfectly matched to the problem that the Court sought to address, namely the risk that the defendant's own self-incriminating statements would be obtained by compulsion and admitted against him to prove his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.253" offset="13444911">That risk implicated two central concerns of the Fifth Amendment, one going to reliability, the other going to the state's burden to prove guilt with evidence other than that extracted from the defendant's own mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.364" offset="13505411">Extension of Miranda to this case, which involves physical evidence that does not involve the reliability concerns that are at the heart of the Fifth Amendment, and does not involve the concern about using the defendant's own self-compelled words to incriminate him, would not only be contrary to the body of authority in the lower courts before this Court's decision in Dickerson and largely after it, but would also be contrary to the purpose of truth-seeking in a criminal trial that is central to the Court's jurisprudence in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.005" offset="13639993">Justice Stevens, I...  as far as the Government is aware, there was no more than a handful of cases in the state courts that have followed the rule, other than what the Federal rule had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.925" offset="13691611">Justice White's dissenting opinion from the denial of certiorari in the Patterson case, I believe, collects them, but this was by no means a groundswell movement in the state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.897" offset="13739572">Well, I understand, but I noticed that in your brief, in your oral statement you said that they were unanimous, your brief said there was a strong majority in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.866" offset="13771442">I haven't checked it out myself but is it...  is it a unanimous view in the Federal courts?</text>

            <text syncTime="3446.785" offset="13787115">My understanding is that there are eight Federal circuits before Dickerson, including the Tenth Circuit, that it held that suppression of derivative physical evidence was not warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.105" offset="13828389">Since Dickerson, only the Tenth Circuit has changed its position, and there is no other court, other than the First Circuit, which follows a rule that depends on...  on balancing deterrence concerns against the loss to...  of evidence to the trial, that follows anything akin to the kind of derivative suppression rule that the Tenth Circuit adopted in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.535" offset="13966106">In our view, Justice Breyer, no different rule is warranted in that situation, because Miranda continues to protect against the risk that it's aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.708" offset="13998811">Absent actual compulsion, there is no warrant for a rule that does anything other than suppress the actual statements.</text>
