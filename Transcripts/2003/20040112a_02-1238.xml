            <text syncTime="61.195" offset="244715">This case concerns 47 U.S.C., section 253(a) which preempts State laws that prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide telecommunications services.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.561" offset="294243">Now, it's common ground that section 253(a) preempts State laws that keep private firms from the telecommunications market.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.953" offset="323709">The question presented is whether the law also reaches into the structure of State government and invalidating even a State statute that declines to grant the State's political subdivisions the authority to provide telecommunications.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.623" offset="374491">In Gregory against Ashcroft, this Court held that Federal statutes should not be construed to intrude on core areas of State sovereignty unless Congress has made its intent to do so clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.018" offset="455993">Under respondents' interpretation, section 253(a) would be a sharp and unprecedented break with that tradition because it would be a grant of power by the Federal Government to political subdivisions of powers that the State, which was hitherto the sole source of their authority...</text>

            <text syncTime="663.849" offset="2655295">There is another provision which says...  I don't remember the number...  which says that there can't be exclusive franchises.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.557" offset="2674207">This is intended to get at laws not only that would by terms give an exclusive franchise or keep a particular company out of the telecommunications business, but also that would have the effect of doing that by imposing high taxes on one category of...  of participants rather than on another category.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.358" offset="2741394">There...  there's the...  in fact, in the Texas case that came before this, the Federal Communications Commission found a couple of provisions of Texas law preempted because they did just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.097" offset="2788310">And the statute was designed...  it is an anti-monopoly law, but it is a little bit broader than just granting exclusive franchises.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.934" offset="2815687">It's also favoring one...  at one...  one company or one class of company or the incumbent telephone company over other new entrants into the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.684" offset="2850691">Respondents cite the...  Lead-Deadwood case as the closest that they can come to this, and I'd just like to point out that that case has a dramatically different question than the one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.628" offset="2910459">In that case, there was no question of the Federal Government giving authority to local...  to political subdivisions that the State itself had not...  had not given.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.832" offset="2947239">That case would be much closer to this case if, for example, the State there had said we don't want our political subdivisions to be providing education because we do that at the State level, and then the political subdivision had taken the Federal money that was at issue there and said we want to open up a local university or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.642" offset="3010560">At least that would have presented the question that's presented here of an intrusion of that sort on State sovereignty, but that wasn't before the Court there and therefore the Court didn't apply a clear statement rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.301" offset="3389127">And that would intrude drastically on the structure of State government.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.645" offset="3402501">A general language term like entity is too broad to meet the Gregory test because it doesn't clearly and unmistakably include State subdivisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.186" offset="3492676">But that standard is important to the States because it gives the States some notice and opportunity to react to proposed legislation that may intrude on State sovereignty, and it requires Congress to be clear in the wording that it uses and to demonstrate cognizance of the impact of legislation on State sovereignty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.724" offset="12486844">And the Court said, well, if they had stopped at employees, maybe they would be giving judges life tenure, but they said employees at the policymaking level and that's just too ambiguous for us to think Congress was doing such a dramatic thing to the structure of State government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.956" offset="12547762">This is nothing like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.608" offset="12554344">This...  this statute simply says that among the universe of entrants that we want in this robust, wide-open, newly competitive field of telecommunications, if municipal corporations, true to their roots as corporations, want to get into this business, the States can't keep them out except if they're doing the kinds of regulation that States can reasonably do to private and public corporations alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.014" offset="12647967">That seems to me not only a coherent reading of the statute, not only one that is consistent with what everyone agrees is the very dramatic pro-competitive turn that the 1996 Telecommunications Act took, but also one that really is not a significant incursion on State sovereignty, certainly not an unprecedented incursion on State sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.160" offset="12728633">When decisions of this Court have held municipalities liable under the antitrust laws, notwithstanding State efforts to immunize them, liable for damages, notwithstanding States' efforts to immunize them, have withdrawn from municipal governments States' efforts to grant them sovereign immunity against State claims in the State court, Congress...</text>

Gregory against Ashcroft is thrown up as an obstacle to their doing what they think is needed to serve their citizens' interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.234" offset="13052865">And given what seems to me to be the unambiguous language of section 253(a) and the very limited circumscribed focused nature of what Congress has done in this circumstance, it seems to me to be an unwarranted conclusion for the...  for the commission to reach.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.435" offset="13145652">I'd like to contrast this case with the Yeskey case, which came up during Mr. Strauss' argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.122" offset="13172402">In the Yeskey case, the Americans with Disabilities Act referred to public entities, I think, and then it defined them as including any department of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.865" offset="13211376">Once...  that meant that in that act, Congress had specifically considered that it was going to intrude deeply, as Justice Scalia said, in State government, and it had made the decisions of how to do it and the whole...  in fact, title II of the act is designed to...  to tailor that, exactly how Congress wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.250" offset="13276996">In this statute, there's no indication that Congress crossed that initial dividing line and wanted...</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="3326.559" offset="13306149">Well, Mr. Strauss points to subsection (b) of the statute as indicating Congress did contemplate giving some leeway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.051" offset="13344183">Yes, Congress did contemplate giving some leeway to the States when it was competitively neutral, but the question of what competitive neutrality means in this context is not an easy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.371" offset="13385456">And...  and I'd like to add that if Congress had had to take the...  do what it did in Yeskey and...  and decide yes, we do want this to apply to the States, it might have occurred to Congress that they were going to have to think about exactly what that means, applying a statute like this to State governments that grant their political subdivisions different kinds of powers in different kinds of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.401" offset="13461525">Congress didn't...  never made that first choice that it consciously wanted to intrude on State...  State sovereignty the way the Eighth Circuit held, and therefore it never answered those other questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.405" offset="13513561">What is the rationale for saying a municipal utility, a wholly owned electric company, wholly owned by the city, that's okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.981" offset="13551909">That doesn't matter...  the State can't stop that from going into the telecommunications, but it can stop the municipal corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.494" offset="13581897">Well, I mean, that is an issue in this case, but the FCC's rationale is that insofar as under State law you have a thing that is treated just like a private corporation, it's...  it's an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.383" offset="13629440">That's exactly who Congress was clearly and directly and most importantly targeting this law at.</text>
