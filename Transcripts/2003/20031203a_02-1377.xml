            <text syncTime="95.086" offset="380343">The argument is made on the other side that, in fact, it would be $1,000 for every publication in this case, for example, for every caption of a... of... of an order that went out, to everyone to whom that order was sent, so that it would not be $1,000, it would be many, many thousands.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.681" offset="474697">The answer to that is no, Justice Souter, and let me answer that in at least two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.594" offset="494341">First of all, the District of Columbia Circuit has already held that the number of... that the $1,000 is key to each individual and not to the number of disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.892" offset="535510">For example, in the Tomasello case in the D.C. Circuit, there was a simultaneous disclosure of information about a single individual to some 4,000 recipients.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.923" offset="575634">--and I think correctly, that that would be considered one disclosure under the act and, thus, the individual would be entitled to only a single $1,000 recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.261" offset="1020970">Let me answer both parts of your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.452" offset="1029747">As to the first part, I... I don't think we can presume that plaintiffs are going to make up an adverse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.344" offset="1057332">They are certainly under the obligations to testify truthfully, and in this case, the Government had every opportunity that... to... and did cross-examine Mr. Doe as to the veracity of his adverse effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.489" offset="1101949">The magistrate found as a matter of fact he did suffer an adverse effect, the district court adopted it and the Government never appealed that finding, so whatever arguments they have at this point are gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.726" offset="1142805">Second part of your question, class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.698" offset="1154717">That's certainly the parade of horribles that the Government is trotting out here, and I think perhaps, Justice Souter, may go more... more directly to your question as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.986" offset="1191915">The answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.465" offset="1201842">Even if an individual who has suffered an adverse effect caused by an intentional or willful violation of the act is entitled to a statutory damages award without being required to quantify actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.697" offset="1262759">There are still at least two individualized issues that will exist in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.899" offset="1283553">One is the pleading and proof of the adverse effect, which necessarily may vary among different plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.534" offset="1314064">Second is the causation, and particularly in the causation question, Justice O'Connor, this is not a... a standard that... that plaintiffs lightly leap over.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.110" offset="1352411">In fact, there are a number of cases, one of which is the Oroquoia decision of the First Circuit, which was handed down while this petition was pending, noted that in cases where the... the adverse effect alleged is a... an emotional distress-type problem, you may well run into causation problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.802" offset="6315154">I'd like to begin by discussing the distinction as we see it between the terms adverse effect and actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.208" offset="6336784">And as one of Justice Scalia's questions indicate, the term adverse effect is not one that originated in the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.069" offset="6360189">It's... it's a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.062" offset="6364160">The general judicial review provision of the Administrative Procedure Act grants a right of action to persons adversely affected or aggrieved, and I don't think it's the case that a plaintiff under the APA needs to show that he has suffered the type of harm that would ordinarily be compensable in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.439" offset="6433750">Because the APA excludes money damages as an available item of relief, the typical inquiry in... under the APA in determining whether a plaintiff has standing is whether he is likely to suffer harm in the future, not whether he has been harmed in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.929" offset="6491638">And if we had a hypothetical APA suit, for instance, challenging an ongoing or imminent program by which the Government intended to release Social Security numbers, and a particular plaintiff could show there is a likelihood that my own Social Security number will be released in the near future, I think that would be sufficient in and of itself to establish that that person was adversely affected or aggrieved within the meaning of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.026" offset="6592052">He would be suffering a... a violation of his legal right to have information about him maintained within the Government's files and he would also suffer at least an increased risk of identity theft.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.007" offset="13252023">Justice Kennedy, I'd like to address my first point to you, because I... I think you put your finger on one of the number of... of absurd results, or difficult-to-swallow results that flow from accepting the Government's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.868" offset="13311373">The Government's essential contention here is that quantification of actual damages is an essential element of a Privacy Act claim, but boy, what a strange way to write the statute if that's what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.985" offset="13367902">The... the relative language is reproduced at pages 3 and 4 of petitioner's brief, and it says that whenever an agency fails to comply with any other provision of this section, and I'm going to ellipsis, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual, the individual may bring a civil action against the agency, and I'm putting another ellipsis there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.669" offset="13450658">You then go to subsection (g)(4), which states that if that adverse effect was the result of an intentional or willful violation, then the Government, the United States shall be liable, in the sum... in an amount equal to the sum of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.789" offset="13523069">Liability is established once those three prerequisites are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.553" offset="13542191">All that is left at that point is an exercise of arithmetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.890" offset="13559536">It would be a very strange statute that says the United States shall be liable in the sum of the following amounts you are to add up, and that amount would be zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.299" offset="13597153">And, in fact, that would never be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.694" offset="13606766">Costs are always available to a Privacy Act plaintiff who establishes an adverse effect caused by an intentional or willful violation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.642" offset="13646472">So there are certainly going to be at least some recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.326" offset="13657234">There's no qualification of the costs award with reasonableness of precondition of actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.839" offset="13687327">So some... there is going to be a recovery in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.995" offset="13699971">Now, if that's the only recovery that's available, it's a very... it's, one, a very strange statute, and number two, a statute that arguably is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.440" offset="13733721">But you don't need to read it that way, because the natural reading is, as was pointed out in the argument, that, yes, Congress did anticipate precisely this issue, that privacy invasions very typically result in emotional harms that inherently are not quantifiable, and Congress didn't intend, I can't imagine, to... to make the line of recovery turn on whether you can prove that you put 37... a 37-cent stamp on an... on an envelope to get your credit report or pay the $10 fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.762" offset="13862975">That's a very arbitrary line.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.029" offset="13908114">Moreover, it reduces any efficiency savings that are realized under the act as Congress intended by saying, look, we're not going to get into those sorts of proof issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.712" offset="14026815">It renders the adverse effect requirement superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.723" offset="14038831">Proof of actual damages will necessarily in every case require proof of an actual harm and causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.917" offset="14063595">So even the attempt by the Government to place a... a meaning on the adverse effect requirement must fail.</text>
