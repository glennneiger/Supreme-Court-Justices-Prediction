            <text syncTime="1314.606" offset="5258344">There are findings in the record which are a part of the brief, with respect to what the... what the pledge means, the context of the pledge in its historical context, in the connection with its civic invocation, its ability to invoke certain principles that are indisputably true, which gave rise to the institutions which have given us freedom over all this period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.063" offset="5348206">It's in... it is significant that the Court in, the Congress, in making those findings, specifically referred to the decisions that I was referring to before, which have been characterized as dicta, but very important dicta, because they explain how the Court came to its conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.237" offset="5416856">So those are differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.602" offset="5422393">The other difference that should be made is that the challenge here too is not directly to the Pledge of Allegiance, but it's to the invocation or the... the articulation of the Pledge of Allegiance in the Elk Grove School District.</text>

            <text syncTime="1478.163" offset="5912555">Thomas Jefferson in his autobiography, which was published in 1811, said there was a motion to amend to refer to the holy author, Jesus Christ, and he said in his autobiography that that was rejected because the framers of the Virginia Bill of Rights, or act establishing religious freedom, which is a precursor to the Establishment Clause, was intended not to include any particular sect, but to... to apply to Jews, Hindus, Mohammedens, and it even says the word infidels in Thomas Jefferson's explanation for the background of that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.488" offset="6057900">In... in summary, the state... the Pledge of Allegiance is not what this Court has said the Establishment Clause protects against, that is to say, state-sponsored prayers, religious rituals or ceremonies, or the imposition or the requirement of teaching or not teaching a religious doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.543" offset="6142119">The Establishment Clause does not prohibit civic and ceremonial acknowledgments of the indisputable historical fact of the religious heritage that caused the framers of our Constitution and the signers of the Declaration of Independence to say that they had the right to revolt and start a new country, because although the king was infallible, they believe that God gave them the right to declare their independence when the king has not been living up to the unalienable principles given to them by God.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.919" offset="12963631">The question is, when you look at what it... the religious part, and then the question is, what are you going to define that as being encompassed in?</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.780" offset="12987037">In Lee v. Weisman, it was the prayer within the context of the graduation and I think it was like an hour and a half for the graduation and two minutes for the prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.839" offset="13015353">So here we have, I think, if you actually multiply and look at the ratio, the ratio of the two words, under God, to the Pledge of Allegiance is greater than the ratio of the time spent on prayer versus the graduation exercise in Lee v. Weisman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.963" offset="13059762">You can do that with anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.061" offset="13064150">We have Allegheny County showing, you know, we... if you talk about the staircase and just being, you know, this individual thing, we could say, well, the staircase is this... this transportation mode just like here the pledge is this patriotic mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.328" offset="13109290">But the question is, why did you stick the creche in the middle of this grand staircase?</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.126" offset="13124441">The question is here, why did you stick these two purely religious words, under God, in the middle of the Pledge of Allegiance?</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.161" offset="13144607">So I would say that it's clear here there is a purely religious purpose, we have purely religious effects, it fails the endorsement test, it fails the outsider test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.501" offset="13177940">Imagine you're this one child with a class full of theists and you... you're... you have this idea that you want to perhaps at least consider and you have everyone imposing their view on you, it fails every test this Court has ever come up with, and there's a principle here and I'm hoping the Court will uphold this principle so that we can finally go back and have every American want to stand up, face the flag, place their hand over their heart and pledge to one nation, indivisible, not divided by religion, with liberty and justice for all.</text>

            <label>Mr. Terence J. Cassidy</label>
            <text syncTime="3325.337" offset="13301342">I would like to take this opportunity to respond to several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.510" offset="13333943">First, under Lynch we know that acknowledgment of the role of religion in American society is not exercising religion, nor is it endorsing religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.420" offset="13373649">Second, respondent has stated his daughter is being required to stand up and say the pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.783" offset="13403115">His daughter is not required to stand up and say the pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.225" offset="13420878">It is the parents' choice, the parent chooses whether the child recites the pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.829" offset="13447314">In this case, the mother has exercised her legal right under the state custody order and we have discussed that previously, but therefore, Mr.... respondent's recourse is to object to the mother's decision, to seek his recourse in state court for the mother's decision, because there is a lack of a causal relationship with respect to his not having a legally protectable right to assert what he seems to be asserting in this case, that it is his daughter who is affected by the pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.325" offset="13573224">Third, following Barnette, schools across the country, including the Elk Grove Unified School District, have developed a number of procedures to accommodate students who wish to opt out of the pledge exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.550" offset="13638113">They do so by consulting with the teachers and the principals, who are in the best position to know how to adopt that to the various class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.310" offset="13677192">In particular, there may be several ways that a child could opt out and exercise the rights that were developed post-Barnette.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.209" offset="13712823">Equally important to the opt-out procedure or the voluntary requirement is the fact that teachers now instruct the students about mutual respect, respect of other belief systems, of all persons' belief systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.417" offset="13765590">Third, I would like to go back to the issue that was presented in this case, which was whether the school district policy violates the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.883" offset="13815432">Respondent conceded at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the school district policy had a secular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.903" offset="13843540">There's nothing in the record to show that the school district policy was adopted solely for religious purpose, nor is there anything in the record that shows there was any religious purpose in adopting the school district policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.771" offset="13899024">Moreover, the Pledge of Allegiance in grammar schools, in public schools, is part of a teaching program, and that's what we're here about, to talk about the educational upbringing of a child, and it has to do with national unity and citizenship of our young students.</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.689" offset="14022740">If the religious portion of the pledge is not intended as a serious affirmation of faith, then every day government asks millions of school children to take the name of the Lord in vain.</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.777" offset="14075089">I would disagree, because we feel that the use of the term, one nation under God, reflects a political philosophy, and the political philosophy of our country, as set forth in the Declaration of Independence, is one is... that ours is one of a limited government, and that is the philosophy that's now more enhanced, more reflected in the 1954 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.790" offset="14175086">But back to our school district policy, which is what is being challenged in this case, I would point the Court to the joint appendix at page 149, which sets forth not only that the pledge is recited in grammar school, but also that the pledge is then... also can be recited in secondary schools, and likewise, that policy provides that school children are to look at all the different components of our history, speeches, historical documents, whether they be state constitutions, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and likewise, that's incorporated into the history and social sciences content standards for California, specifically at grade one level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.431" offset="14381662">Not only are the students learning the Pledge of Allegiance and singing songs such as My Country 'Tis of Thee, but likewise they're learning about the Declaration of Independence, so they are learning about our country's nationalism and civic unity at a very early stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.007" offset="14455954">They don't say the Pledge of Allegiance and go home.</text>
